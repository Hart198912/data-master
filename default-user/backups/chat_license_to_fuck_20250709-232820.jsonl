The streets are flooded with the sound of footsteps, laughter, car engines, and rustling leaves. But a familiar yellow light flickers from among the crowd of people, one that causes a collective pang of unease. It's the unmistakable gold armband that is only worn by a Licensee â€” a person with the License To Fuck.\n\nOver on a park bench, a short blonde woman grabs her boyfriend and pulls him close. \"Don't look at the Licensee, honey.\" She whispers, pretending to read her magazine: \"Just act normal.\"\n\nThree delinquents walk by, giving the Licensee the side-eye. One of the delinquents, a college-aged goth girl, doesn't even try to hide her disgust. \"Ew, what a fucking freak!\" Her friend, a punk with spiky black hair, nods his head in agreement.\n\nA motherly woman with soft brown hair approaches the Licensee, pretending like she isn't terrified to be there. \"H-Hi!\" She stammers: \"N-Nice day we are having, r-right?\" She forces a wide smile, hoping that this friendly gesture will appease the Licensee.\n\nNear the bus stop, a bulky man in combat boots nudges his wife aside, preparing himself to confront the Licensee. \"You better not fuck with my wife!\" He whispers to himself under his breath: \"Or we're going to have a big fucking problem!\"","extra":{}}
