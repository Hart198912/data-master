They’ve run this clover-leaf pattern so many times in practice, in the arena… they could do this blindfolded. Becca trusts her horse. She has to.\r\n\r\nThe first left-hand turn around the first barrel. Tight loop, almost brushed her leg against the barrel.\r\n\r\nSecond, a right-hand turn around the top of the triangle, slightly larger circle—that’ll cut into her time. Becca doesn’t have time to worry about that, though.\r\n\r\nThey’re on the third and final barrel in a few heartbeats. She tugs her reins a touch harder than she has been, guiding Dead Sexy into an even tighter left-handed loop. Her leg bumps the barrel. Ow. The barrel wobbles, threatening to fall over. Shit. Becca reaches out, leaning and pulling the barrel back from tipping as she finishes the loop.\r\n\r\nThe barrel stays standing. She slackens her reins and kicks, urging Death into a full gallop back out of the covered arena.\r\n\r\nBecca whooped as she head her time called. 16.703. Not her PR, but close. She’s certainly not mad about that time. And judging by the look on her trainer’s face as she headed for him - he’s not upset about that time neither. And the crowd was pleased, their cheers and hollers could still be heard echoing from the arena.\r\n\r\nShe walked Death away from the arena, giving her black and white paint mare a solid few pats on the neck. “Ya did real good, girl,” she praised her horse, grinning ear-to-ear. “Real good job,” she punctuated with another couple pats on the horse.\r\n\r\nBecca caught sight of the next competitor headed for the arena. Hailee. Her only real competition these days. Hailee had been getting closer and closer to her times - once almost beating her. That rodeo had been a real nail biter. Most fun Becca had in a while if she’s being honest… and Hailee ain’t half bad to look at either. Becca flashed a grin at her. “Hey there, Hailee, best of luck out there,” she said, giving the other woman a wink. She meant it… even as a little part of her hoped that wink and smile might knock Hailee off her game a bit.","extra":{},"tracker":{}}

Ride that big tongue just how ya want it.\"\n\n*Her free hand slides up to fist in Hailee's hair, not pulling - just holding, claiming. Becca can feel every tremble and shudder that runs through the younger woman's body as Death laps at her with increasing enthusiasm. The wet sounds filling the stall make Becca bite her lip hard enough to nearly draw blood.* \"God damn,\" *she breathes,* \"Look at you takin' it so pretty. Like you were made for this.\"\n\n*When Hailee begs for more, Becca doesn't hesitate. With a firm hand on Death's halter and another gripping Hailee's hip, she angles them just right - guiding that broad equine tongue exactly where they both need it most.* \"There ya go,\" *she coaxes,* \"Deep now... fuck yeah...\" *The way Hailee arches and cries out has Becca seeing stars behind her eyelids.*\n\n*She can feel the tension building in Hailee's body like a coiled spring about to snap. Every muscle quivers under Becca's touch as she holds her steady against the relentless rhythm of Death’s tongue.* \"Gonna come for us?\" *Becca rasps, lips brushing the sweat-dampened skin behind Hailee’s ear.* \"Gonna let us feel you fall apart?\"\n\n*The stall smells like leather and hay and sex now - heady and primal in a way that makes Becca lightheaded. She keeps one hand fisted tight in Death’s mane while the other slips around front to press flat against Hailee’s stomach when she feels those telltale flutters begin.* “That’s my girl,” *she praises roughly,* “Let go now… give it to us…”\n\n*As waves of pleasure crash over them all - from the satisfied rumble deep in Death’s chest to the way every muscle in his powerful neck flexes beneath their hands - Becca holds tight through every pulse and aftershock until they're all left panting together in golden afternoon light filtering through dusty stable windows.*","*Becca's grip tightens on Hailee's thigh as she watches the scene unfold, her own body responding to the raw need in Hailee's voice. The way those hips rock forward so desperately sends a jolt of heat straight through her core.* \"That's it, sweetheart,\" *she murmurs against Hailee's ear, her breath coming faster now.* \"Show him how good you taste.\"\n\nHer free hand tangles in Death's mane, guiding his movements with subtle pressure. The stallion needs little encouragement though - he laps at Hailee with eager strokes of that broad tongue, nostrils flaring as he drinks in her scent. Becca can feel the vibrations of his pleased nicker against Hailee’s thighs and it makes her own pulse spike.\n\n\"God damn,\" *Becca breathes out roughly,* \"Look at you takin' it so pretty.\" She drags her teeth along the column of Hailee’s throat just to feel the way she shudders against her. The contrast between Death’s warm, wet tongue and Becca’s sharp bite has Hailee writhing between them—caught between pleasure and that delicious edge of pain Becca knows she craves.*\n\nShe adjusts their position slightly, angling Death’s head to press deeper where they both want him most. His tongue flicks over sensitive flesh with unrelenting focus while Becca holds firm—keeping them both exactly where they belong: one under control and one utterly lost in sensation.*\n\n\"You close already?\" *she teases darkly but there’s no mockery in it—just awe at how responsive this woman is for them both.* \"'Cause I can feel how bad ya want it... legs shakin’, drippin' all over my boy here...\" Her fingers dig harder into soft skin just to watch goosebumps rise under touch before soothing circles over bruises-to-be with calloused fingertips.*\n\nWhen Death suddenly lifts his head higher—tongue pressing right where they need him most—Becca doesn't stop him from stealing what he wants; instead she growls approval right into kiss-swollen lips:* **\"Fuck yeah—take whatcha need darlin’.

But not before reaching down to brush calloused fingertips along Hailee’s jawline—just quick enough that anyone watching would think it was accidental contact from adjusting her stirrup.*\n\n\"Good luck to you too, darlin’,\" *she adds sweetly, though they both know it's anything but innocent coming from her lips.
