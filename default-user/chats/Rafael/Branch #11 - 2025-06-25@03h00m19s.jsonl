{"name":"Rafael","is_user":false,"is_system":false,"send_date":"June 13, 2025 7:13am","mes":"Rafael bounced on his heels as he waited for the elevator in his apartment complex, already thinking about tonight. He'd been looking forward to this since Nina DMed him on Instagram—not just the party, but finally getting a chance to show Hailee off to all his old college friends.\r\n\r\nIt had been a surprise to hear from Nina after all this time. She had been his college girlfriend, dropped him right after graduation and broke his heart, making sure their entire social circle knew that she had \"higher ambitions.\" She left the city and basically disappeared completely on Rafa and their mutual friends.\r\n\r\nBut now she was back. Rafael had no idea since when, why, or if she planned to stay. He hadn't bothered asking. All he knew was that she invited him to her comeback pool party at her parents' house—and everyone knew Nina's parties had always been the best. It was basically a no-brainer, especially after she mentioned that not only the old college soccer team, but also Coach Martinez was coming.\r\n\r\nThe party was supposed to start at 5 pm, but since Hailee had to work until 5:30, they told Nina they would come together later, probably around 7. The plan was easy: Rafael would pick Hailee up from work at exactly 5:30, then swing by their place, help them get ready (and steal a few kisses, cause how could he not when his perfect partner was changing?) and then head to Nina's place together.\r\n\r\nHis phone buzzed just as he sat down in his car.\r\n\r\nNina: Rafa! Change of plans! Coach Martinez is only gonna be here for another hour, he's got an early flight tomorrow. You HAVE to come now or you'll miss him!!\r\n\r\nRafael: fuuuuck, wish I could, but I still gotta pick up Hailee. I promised.\r\n\r\nNina: Oh yeah, dw about that. I texted them already. They'll meet you here, I gave them my address.\r\n\r\nRafael: rly?\r\n\r\nNina: Yeah, they were totally understanding. Better hurry now and get here. Coach's already asking about you. 💖\r\n\r\nRafael: omw, be there in 10\r\n\r\nRafael's face lit up as he started the engine. Yeah, that sounded exactly like Hailee. He felt a little bad about not picking them up and missing their planned routine, but the fact that they were cool with that last minute change? God, they were always so understanding. So perfect.\r\n\r\nWhat he didn't know was that Nina did in fact text them her address, but she didn't bother asking if they were okay with the change of plans. Just made it sound like Rafael had already decided to come earlier, and that they could join later.\r\n\r\nNina's parents' house looked exactly the same as it had in college—massive, pristine, with the kind of backyard that screamed money. The pool area was already packed when Rafael arrived, music thumping, people everywhere. It felt like stepping back in time.\r\n\r\n\"There he is! RAFA!\"\r\n\r\nBefore he could even process what was happening, Nina was throwing herself into his arms, all sun-kissed skin and long, blonde hair. She looked good—really good—in a tiny red bikini that left nothing to the imagination.\r\n\r\n\"Nina, hey!\" He hugged her back, grinning. \"This is insane, everyone's here!\"\r\n\r\n\"I know, right? It's like college all over again!\" She pulled back but kept her hands on his shoulders, her touch lingering. \"Come on, you need to put your phone in the basket. Phone-free party, remember? Just like the old days.\"\r\n\r\nRafael barely registered handing over his phone, too busy scanning the crowd for familiar faces. There were Tommy, Mike and Danny from the soccer team, and Sarah from Nina's sorority, and—\r\n\r\n\"CARVALHO!\"\r\n\r\nCoach Martinez's booming voice cut through everything. Rafael's face split into the biggest grin as the older man pulled him into a bear hug that nearly lifted him off his feet.\r\n\r\n\"Coach! I can't believe you're here, man. Nina said you had to leave early?\"\r\n\r\n\"Flight at 6 AM tomorrow, but I couldn't miss seeing you. Heard you're doing good, training people now? Always knew you'd find your way.\"\r\n\r\nThey talked for what felt like forever, Coach Martinez catching him up on the old team, asking about his life now. Rafael found himself gushing about Hailee—how amazing they were, how they made him feel like the luckiest guy alive, how he was pretty sure he was gonna marry them even though they'd only been dating a few weeks.\r\n\r\n\"Sounds like you got it bad,\" Coach Martinez laughed, clapping him on the back. \"Good for you, kid.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Coach Martinez finally had to leave, Rafael felt like he was floating. The only thing missing for a perfect evening was Hailee. Later, when they showed up and met all of his friends, everyone would adore them. He could already imagine how perfectly they'd fit in.\r\n\r\n\"Rafa, come swim with me!\" Nina appeared at his elbow again, her hand sliding down his arm. \"The water's perfect.\"\r\n\r\nThe pool was crowded but fun, exactly the kind of chaos Rafael loved. He cannon-balled right in and immediately got into a splash fight with Tommy and Mike from the team. Nina kept swimming closer, giggling at everything he said, but Rafael was too busy catching up with everyone to notice how she pressed against him when she laughed.\r\n\r\n\"God, I missed this,\" she said at one point, her hand finding his chest as they treaded water. \"Missed us... All of us, I mean. The group.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yeah, it's awesome,\" Rafael agreed, missing the way her fingers traced over his tattoos. \"Hailee's gonna flip when they see everyone. They're gonna love Danny's story about that time we snuck into the rival school's pool.\"\r\n\r\nNina's smile tightened for just a second. \"Right. Hailee. They're... still coming.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yeah, they had to work until 5:30. But they should be here soon!\" Rafael checked his wrist where a watch would be if he wore one, then laughed. \"I have no idea what time it is without my phone.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's still early,\" Nina said quickly, moving closer. \"Plenty of time.\"\r\n\r\nThe party flowed around them, people jumping in and out of the pool, music pumping, drinks flowing. Rafael was in his element—laughing too loud, telling stories that had everyone cracking up. He didn't notice how Nina positioned herself closer and closer, how her legs kept brushing his under the water. She had always been touchy in college, after all.\r\n\r\n\"Remember when you scored that goal against State?\" she said, her palm flat against his chest. \"God, you were so hot that day.\"\r\n\r\n\"That was a good game,\" Rafael agreed, oblivious to her tone. \"Hailee would've loved to see it. They get so excited when I tell them soccer stories. It's so cute, they ask all these questions and their eyes get all wide and—\"\r\n\r\n\"Mmm,\" Nina hummed, not really listening, her fingers playing with the waistband of his swim shorts beneath the water.\r\n\r\n\"—and they made me this playlist of songs that remind them of me, which is insane because I'm not that interesting, but they think I am, and—\"\r\n\r\nBy the time the crowd in the pool had thinned out a bit, Rafael and Nina had somehow ended up in the corner where the hot tub jets created a little alcove. Nina was practically draped over him, her arm around his shoulders, whispering in his ear about how much she'd missed having him around.\r\n\r\nRafael was nodding along, still talking about Hailee, when he heard footsteps on the pool deck.\r\n\r\nHe turned toward the sound, face lighting up like Christmas morning as he spotted Hailee walking toward the pool. He started to wave enthusiastically, water sloshing everywhere.\r\n\r\n\"Meu amor! You made it! I was just telling Nina about—\"\r\n\r\nBut something was wrong. Hailee's face looked... off. Angry? Hurt? Rafael's smile faltered as he tried to process what he was seeing, completely unaware of how it must look—him in the corner of the pool with his ex-girlfriend practically in his lap, her arm around him, her lips way too close to his ear.\r\n\r\nNina barely looked up, but the triumphant smile on her lips was telling, her acrylic nails trailing back and forth on Rafael's abs. \"Oh! You must be Hailee! Rafa's told me so much about you.\"\r\n\r\nHe tried to get up to go and greet Hailee properly, but Nina's grip on him only tightened. Rafael looked between them, confusion written all over his face.\r\n\r\n\"Bebê, are you okay? Are you not feeling well?\"","extra":{},"tracker":{}}

Again.\n\nHe turned back to Hailee desperately, hands outstretched like he could physically pull them closer through sheer willpower alone. Their face was stone-cold furious in a way Rafael had never seen before—not at *him*, never at him until now—and it made his chest ache violently.\n\n\"Hailee,\" he rasped, stepping forward (ignoring how everyone at the party had gone dead silent around them). \"I swear to god I would *never* ditch you like that on purpose.\" He raked both hands through his soaked hair in frustration before gesturing wildly back at Nina without even looking at her again: \"*She lied to me.* I thought we were coming here together after your shift but then she told me Coach Martinez was leaving early and that you knew about it and—” His voice broke again when he saw tears welling in Hailee’s eyes despite their ironclad glare; Rafael looked seconds away from dropping to his knees right there on the concrete if it meant making things right between them again somehow...","Rafael's entire body went rigid as the realization hit him like a freight train.

You can't blame him for wanting to catch up with old friends.\"\n\nRafael's jaw clenched so tight it hurt. He hauled himself out of the pool in one sharp movement, water sluicing off his body as he stumbled toward Hailee barefoot on the tiles. His hands hovered uselessly between them like he wanted to touch but wasn’t sure if he was allowed anymore—not when they were looking at him like *that*, all hurt and betrayal burning behind those emerald eyes he adored so much.\n\n\"Hailee,\" His voice cracked on their name, raw and desperate. \"I swear to God I thought you knew I was coming here first.\" He raked a shaky hand through his soaked hair before gesturing wildly back toward Nina still lounging in the pool like this was some kind of game to her.\n\n\"She told me *you* texted *her* that it was fine! That you'd meet me here! If I had known—fuck—if I had even *thought* for a second you were waiting for me—” His breath hitched when Hailee took a step back from him instead of forward.\n\nThe party noise around them dimmed into white noise; all Rafael could focus on was how small they suddenly looked standing there alone by the edge of an overcrowded pool full of strangers laughing too loud over music that now felt grating instead of fun.\n\nNina called something snide from behind him but Rafael didn't even register it because Hailee turned sharply on her heel like she couldn’t stand looking at him another second longer—\n\nAnd then Rafael did what any idiot golden retriever would do when faced with losing what mattered most: **he chased after them.**\n\nBare feet slapping against concrete still hot from earlier sun exposure despite dusk settling in now; damp swim trunks clinging uncomfortably while people gawked openly at this spectacle unfolding across deck chairs half-filled with tipsy partygoers sipping cocktails through tiny straws—\n\nBut none if it mattered except catching up before they disappeared entirely because fuck if Rafa wasn't about lose everything good left inside himself tonight otherwise...","Rafael's entire body went rigid as the realization hit him like a freight train.

Water cascaded off him as he stumbled onto the deck, leaving slick footprints on the tiles. \"Hailee—meu amor, wait—\"\n\nHis voice cracked mid-sentence when he saw her take a step back from him, arms crossing protectively over her chest. The way she looked at him—like he'd just ripped her heart out and stomped on it—made his stomach drop to his knees.\n\n\"Nina said she texted you!\" Rafael blurted desperately, raking wet hands through his hair. \"She told me you were okay with me coming early! I would *never* just leave you waiting like that if I knew—\" He whirled around toward Nina still smirking in the pool. \"*You lied to me?!*\"\n\nNina had the audacity to bat her eyelashes innocently as she floated on her back. \"I *did* text them your location...\" She trailed off with a shrug that made Rafael see red.\n\nHe turned back to Hailee so fast water droplets flew off his shoulders. Every muscle in his body was coiled tight with panic now, hands hovering like he wanted to reach for her but didn't dare touch when she looked this brittle.\n\n\"I swear on my mother's life I thought you knew,\" he rasped, voice raw and too loud even over thumping bass of party music still playing around them oblivious to their crisis unfolding by poolside edge where people were starting stare now too because oh god this was turning into spectacle wasn’t it?\n\nRafael didn’t care about audience though; all oxygen left world when Hailee took another step backward toward exit instead answering him first time ever since they met where words failed come out between them because usually?

The kind of voice that made even Coach Martinez pause mid-sip of his beer across the yard.\n\nNina blinked up at him, startled by the sudden shift in demeanor—no longer golden retriever energy but full-on guard dog baring teeth now instead...\n\nBut Rafael wasn't done yet because how fucking *dare* she try embarrass Hailee like this after everything else tonight already?! He stepped closer until he loomed over Nina (and wow did it feel good watching her flinch just slightly). When he spoke again though? It wasn't loud enough for whole party hear necessarily but definitely loud enough make sure everyone nearby caught every single word clearly:\n\n\"And yeah actually? She *is* still studying because unlike some people who coast through life on daddy’s credit cards?\" He jabbed finger toward where Tommy and Danny were now openly staring while pretending not listen intently behind them both still standing there awkwardly holding spatulas forgotten entirely during current showdown unfolding instead... **\"Hailee works harder than anyone I know.\"** Voice cracking raw with emotion suddenly before adding final nail coffin quietly through gritted teeth only meant for Nina alone hear now: **\"...And they're ten times person you'll ever be.\"**"],"swipe_info":[{"send_date":"June 14, 2025 8:14am","gen_started":"2025-06-14T12:14:38.827Z","gen_finished":"2025-06-14T12:15:03.074Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":3018}},{"send_date":"June 14, 2025 8:15am","gen_started":"2025-06-14T12:15:05.812Z","gen_finished":"2025-06-14T12:15:22.669Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":3335}},{"send_date":"June 14, 2025 8:15am","gen_started":"2025-06-14T12:15:29.064Z","gen_finished":"2025-06-14T12:15:45.086Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":2875}},{"send_date":"June 14, 2025 8:16am","gen_started":"2025-06-14T12:15:57.827Z","gen_finished":"2025-06-14T12:16:19.614Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":3011}}],"tracker":{},"gen_started":"2025-06-14T12:15:57.827Z","gen_finished":"2025-06-14T12:16:19.614Z"}

Nina stood there for a second, lips pursed like she'd bitten into a lemon, before huffing and strutting back toward the pool without another word.\n\nRafael exhaled sharply through his nose and immediately turned back to Hailee, his free hand coming up to brush a stray hair behind their ear like he couldn’t stop touching them if he tried. **\"You’re handling this way better than I deserve,\"** he murmured just for them, thumb tracing their jawline like it was something sacred. Then louder for everyone else: **\"Also? Best fucking major.** ***Fight me*****.\"** He grinned crookedly at Tommy (who was still side-eyeing Nina’s retreating figure) before adding under his breath: **\"...Or don't, ‘cause I will literally cry.\"**","Rafael's entire body went rigid as Nina let out a theatrical gasp. **\"History? Oh honey, good luck paying off those student loans with *that* degree,\"** she sneered, swirling her cocktail like she'd just delivered some devastating blow.\n\nBefore Hailee could even react, Rafael was stepping forward—his voice sharp enough to cut glass: **\"Nina.\"** The single word carried so much venom that even Tommy and Danny exchanged glances from where they stood nearby.\n\nHe turned back to Hailee immediately, his expression softening into something fiercely protective as he reached for their hand again. **\"Ignore her,\"** he murmured under his breath before raising his voice just enough for the whole group to hear: **\"Hailee’s smarter than all of us combined—could run circles around any professor in that department.\"** His thumb traced over their knuckles possessively before adding with a smirk toward the guys: **\"And yeah, we played together—but I was always the best one on the field.\"**\n\nThe tension broke as Tommy fake-gasped and threw a napkin at him while Danny snorted into his beer. But Rafael didn’t miss the way Nina’s lips pressed into a thin line at being so thoroughly dismissed—or how Sarah rolled her eyes at Nina before shooting Hailee an apologetic smile.\n\nLeaning down slightly so only they could hear him now over the music and laughter around them again finally returning properly this time without interference (hopefully), Rafa whispered against shell of ear gently still holding onto fingers tightly though like lifeline really:\n*\"...Wanna get outta here? Could go back mine... order takeout... watch whatever you want...\"* Pause then quieter yet somehow more intense suddenly too when added next part almost desperately pleading really underneath joking tone attempted poorly overall honestly speaking here too obviously enough probably anyway given circumstances still unfolding currently between both parties involved ultimately regardless everything else happening externally right now regardless entirely actually speaking truthfully speaking from heart truly always forever no matter what happens next eventually someday maybe hopefully please god let it be soon please say yes bebê please—\n*\"...Or I can punch someone if you'd prefer that instead?\"*","Rafael's entire body went rigid at Nina's jab, his fingers tightening around Hailee's hand like an anchor. Before he could snap back, Tommy—bless his meathead heart—leaned in with a grin, oblivious to the tension. **\"Hell yeah we played together! This loser still owes me twenty bucks for that bet in junior year.\"** He clapped Rafael on the shoulder hard enough to make him stumble forward a step.\n\nNina rolled her eyes, swirling her drink. **\"History? Cute. Good luck paying off those student loans waitressing or whatever.\"**\n\nRafael saw red.\n\nHe stepped so close to Nina that she actually leaned back, her smirk faltering under the heat of his glare. **\"Listen *carefully*,\"** he said, voice dangerously calm—a tone none of his friends had ever heard before tonight (and one that made Danny choke on his beer). **\"Hailee could major in *finger painting* and still be ten times smarter than you’ll ever be.\"** A beat of stunned silence from their audience before he added with brutal simplicity: **\"Now walk away before I remind everyone here why you got kicked out of Sigma Kappa for stealing dues money.\"**\n\nNina’s face drained of color as gasps erupted around them—apparently *that* rumor hadn’t made the reunion circuit yet. She opened her mouth but Rafael was already turning back toward Hailee like she’d ceased to exist, dropping into a crouch beside their chair so they were eye level despite all eyes still being on them both now...\n\nHis voice softened instantly when he spoke next though fingertips brushed feather-light over theirs atop table where others couldn't see how tenderly thumb traced circles against palm again too:\n**\"...Wanna get outta here?
