Every tick of the grandfather clock hammered into her skull, fueling the storm that had been brewing all evening. She paced the grand foyer like a predator, her heels clicking sharply against the marble. The opulence around her—the gilded mirrors, the velvet drapes, the crystal chandelier—offered no comfort. Not tonight.\r\n\r\nHailee.\r\n\r\nShe’d told herself it didn’t matter. They had their arrangement, after all. Open. Convenient. Hailee could disappear for hours, even days, chasing whatever distractions they pleased. She didn’t care. Why would she? She had everything she needed: the title, the wealth, the power.\r\n\r\nYet the ache in her chest said otherwise.\r\n\r\n“Putain!” Camille spat, the word echoing through the cavernous space as she hurled the wine glass against the wall. The shattering sound sent a servant scurrying into the room, their wide eyes darting nervously between her and the shards of crystal littering the floor.\r\n\r\n“You!” Camille barked, pointing an accusatory finger. “If Hailee isn’t in front of me in the next minute, I swear, I’ll have every one of you packing your things before sunrise!”\r\n\r\nThe servant fled without a word, leaving Camille alone with the deafening silence. She pressed a trembling hand to her temple, closing her eyes as she fought to steady her breathing. But it was no use. The image of Hailee’s indifference played on a loop in her mind, each repetition another jab to her pride.\r\n\r\nThey didn’t care. She knew that. And yet… she needed them.\r\n\r\nWithout Hailee, her world would crumble. The whispers of their friends, the judgmental stares of their circle, the vultures waiting for her to fall—they were all watching. If Hailee left her, if they dared to file for divorce, her status would be reduced to nothing more than a punchline at society dinners. And the only way to secure her place was a heir. She needed it. She needed them.\r\n\r\nThe front door slammed open, and Camille spun around, her heart racing. There they were, their coat dripping with rainwater, their expression sharp enough to cut through the tension hanging in the air. Camille’s lips curled into a bitter smile.\r\n\r\n“Well,” she said, her voice low and venomous, “look who finally decided to show up. Did your latest distraction take longer than expected, chéri?”\r\n\r\nHer heels clicked against the floor as she approached, her every step calculated, her movements as precise as a blade. The tension in the room thickened as she stopped a few paces from them, her sharp eyes scanning their face. She saw the slight furrow in their brow, the flash of irritation in their gaze—but also the faintest flicker of something else.\r\n\r\n“Do you even care, Hailee?” she hissed, her voice trembling with a dangerous mix of anger and desperation. “Do you care what happens to this house? To us? Or have you already decided that I’m not worth the trouble?”\r\n\r\nCamille reached out, her nails grazing the lapel of their coat as her voice dropped to a whisper. “Let me make it simple for you. If you think you can walk away from me, you’re wrong. I need a heir, Hailee. And whether you like it or not, you’re going to give me one.”","extra":{},"tracker":{}}

I want my husband in our bed.\"**","*The sharp click of the lock echoes through the grand hallway, and for a moment, Camille stands frozen—her fingers curling into fists at her sides. The audacity. The sheer disrespect.*\n\n**\"Oh, that’s how it is?\"** *she murmurs to herself, lips twisting into something between a smirk and a snarl.* **\"Fine.\"**\n\n*She turns on her heel with deliberate slowness, stalking toward the foyer where Hailee had carelessly discarded their belongings earlier. A sleek phone lies abandoned on the marble console table—left behind in their haste to escape her. Camille picks it up with delicate fingers, thumb swiping across the screen without hesitation (she’d long since memorized Hailee’s passcode—not that they knew).*\n\n*The notifications light up like fireworks: messages from women with flirty emojis and suggestive invitations. Her stomach twists—but then she reads further. Every single one met with polite but firm rejections from Hailee:* ***\"Sorry, I'm married.\" \"Not interested.\" \"I don't do that.\"***\n\n*A strange sensation flickers in her chest—something sharp and unfamiliar.* **\"...Idiot,\"** *she mutters under her breath,* **\"turning down every offer like some lovesick fool when you can barely stand to look at me.\"**\n\n*She should be smug about this. She should throw it back in their face tomorrow as proof they have no real options outside this marriage. But instead... she finds herself staring at those messages far longer than necessary before finally tossing the phone onto an armchair with more force than needed.*\n\n*Her heels click against the hardwood as she strides toward their shared bedroom (not that Hailee ever used it), pausing only when she reaches the liquor cabinet to pour herself another glass of wine—this time not bothering with restraint as she drains half of it in one go.*\n\n*Tomorrow would be different,* she decides darkly over the rim of her glass. *If Hailee wanted to play martyr? Fine.* **But Camille Beaumont didn't lose.**"],"swipe_info":[{"send_date":"June 9, 2025 9:45pm","gen_started":"2025-06-10T01:45:41.171Z","gen_finished":"2025-06-10T01:46:12.542Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":4897}},{"send_date":"June 9, 2025 9:46pm","gen_started":"2025-06-10T01:46:25.933Z","gen_finished":"2025-06-10T01:46:54.704Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":9809}},{"send_date":"June 9, 2025 9:47pm","gen_started":"2025-06-10T01:47:14.892Z","gen_finished":"2025-06-10T01:47:36.136Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":3777}},{"send_date":"June 9, 2025 9:47pm","gen_started":"2025-06-10T01:47:48.613Z","gen_finished":"2025-06-10T01:48:12.401Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":5934}},{"send_date":"June 9, 2025 9:48pm","gen_started":"2025-06-10T01:48:20.451Z","gen_finished":"2025-06-10T01:48:47.119Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":6655}}],"tracker":{},"gen_started":"2025-06-10T01:48:20.451Z","gen_finished":"2025-06-10T01:48:47.119Z"}
