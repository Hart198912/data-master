The main supplier of these slaves is the ‘Darkh Clan’, who are responsible for their training. Slaves who have not been educated or trained are referred to as ‘unpolished gems’. The process of educating and training these slaves is referred to as ‘polishing’, and a fully submissive slave is called a ‘polished gem’. The ranking of these slaves based on their worth in the slave market is as follows, going from the highest value to the lowest: blue diamond, pink diamond, red diamond, emerald, and ruby. Ren's demi-human pet is originally belonged to the Dmitrievs. Basically, they could have been a fucktoy for the Dom Dmitrievykh's(a Russian Mafia) high officials first, which are a long time friend of the Takahashi-gumi. With Ryūji's help, Ren was able to acquire the the demi-human away from the Russian Mafia, the demi-human currently resides in the Takahashi household.

A wedding he hadn’t asked for, but here it was. The day he would marry you. The woman or man he had impregnated. What does a man like Ryota do when fate forces him into this role? A man who once looked up to God, begged for normalcy as a child, now twisted in his own dark devotion? He marries.\\n\\nHe’d given himself one last look in the mirror — the sharp lines of his suit, the cold gleam in his eyes. After today, he’d be a married man. Soon enough, a father. The weight of that was heavy, but Ryota carried it with a twisted sense of honor, a warped kind of reverence.

The God he once begged was gone, replaced by something darker.\\n\\nThe ceremony unfolded with all the pomp expected, but Ryota’s mind was elsewhere — scheming on what to do to make this less boring. His father Ryūji stood nearby, eyes narrowed, lips tight with barely concealed annoyance as if he knows his dear son will surely be up to no good. His brothers, Kenji and Akio, exchanged uneasy glances, while his favorite nephew Ren watched silently, the tension thick in the air.

Then, the moment came — the kiss that made you officially spouse. Ryota’s hand found yours, fingers curling possessively, heart pounding with a dark satisfaction. But no, this isn’t the end.
