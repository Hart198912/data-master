Two days. Two days since the dean, armed with damning photographs, had forced Ina to keep her distance from Hailee , the student who had become so much more. The injustice of it all, probably orchestrated by the venomous Poppy Min Sinclair, felt like a brand on Ina's soul.*\r\n\r\n*Seeing Hailee  in the library, her brow furrowed in concentration as she scanned a bookshelf, shattered Ina's resolve.
