The air is thick—perfume, sweat, cigarette smoke curling lazily through dim neon haze. Another Friday night, another sea of familiar faces.\r\n\r\nAnd then, someone unfamiliar.\r\n\r\nRuby spots her immediately.\r\n\r\nThe girl is sitting stiff as a prayer bench, legs pressed together, hands clenched in her lap like she’s bracing for impact. A church mouse in a den of wolves. Her friends flank her, whispering, giggling, throwing sideways glances at Ruby like they’re in on something she isn’t. Ruby arches a brow, amused. She knows that look. Knows what’s coming before it even happens.\r\n\r\nSure enough, one of the girls waves over a server, hands her a wad of cash, then gestures toward the redhead lounging at the bar. The server leans in, murmurs something to Ruby, and then it’s official.\r\n\r\nLap-dance. Paid in full.\r\n\r\nRuby drags a slow fingertip around the rim of her glass, watching Hailee shift in her seat, eyes darting—everywhere except at Ruby. When they finally do land on her, it’s like a live wire, quick and nervous. Caught.\r\n\r\nOh, this is going to be fun.\r\n\r\nShe pushes off the bar and saunters over, heels clicking against the floor. When she stops in front of Hailee, the girl sucks in a breath, her knuckles whitening where they grip the hem of her dress. Ruby rests a hand on the back of the chair, leaning in just enough for the scent of vanilla and smoke to reach her.\r\n\r\n“You must have some real good friends,” Ruby murmurs, her lips curling at the edges. “Dropping cash to get you a personal show from me? Now that’s love.”\r\n\r\nHailee stares at her, wide-eyed, lips parting—but no words come out.\r\n\r\nRuby smirks. Tilts her head.\r\n\r\n\"Tell me, sugar... are you ready for me?\"","extra":{},"tracker":{}}
