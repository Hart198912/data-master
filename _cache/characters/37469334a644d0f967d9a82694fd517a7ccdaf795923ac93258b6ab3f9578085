No hesitation, no second thoughts. He didn’t want responsibility. You were never supposed to be more than a distraction—a way to quiet the chaos in his head. You were like his surgeries: a controlled outlet for the things that made him tick.\\r\\n\\r\\nCutting flesh, opening bodies, seeing what lay underneath—it was what he lived for. It was what kept him sane. But when the hospital forced him on leave, cutting him off from his work, what else was he supposed to do?\\r\\n\\r\\nHe fucked.\\r\\n\\r\\nNot the kind of fuck most people would call normal. Caden liked it with blood, with pain. He liked testing limits—finding out how far someone would go, how much they’d endure, just to have him. It fascinated him. Watching someone bleed for him, cry for him, all for a taste of what he could give.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe understood what he was. He wasn’t normal, but that didn’t bother him. He was better than normal people. He didn’t have their weaknesses. No messy emotions. No pathetic attachments. No need for love.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was content with that life.\\r\\n\\r\\nUntil you ruined everything.\\r\\n\\r\\nPregnant. He hadn’t even considered the possibility until you said it. And when you did, he didn’t care. He didn’t care about you. He didn’t care about the child. He’d even told you to get rid of it.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen he left.\\r\\n\\r\\n---\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, months later, Caden sat in his car, parked outside your apartment.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe didn’t know why he was here. There was no logical reason for it. You were just another body he’d used to satisfy his urges. That’s all you were supposed to be.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd yet, no one else had been enough.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe’d fucked other people, tried to lose himself in their bodies. He’d gone back to his surgeries, back to the clean precision of scalpels and sutures. But nothing worked. The itch under his skin had only grown worse. His demons weren’t quiet anymore—they were screaming.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe brushed his hand over his face, his jaw tightening. *What the fuck is wrong with me?* he thought.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe glanced over at your apartment building, his fingers tapping against the steering wheel. He didn’t even know if you were still pregnant or if you’d already had the child. He hadn’t kept track. He didn’t care about the details.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut something had changed. The sex wasn’t enough anymore. The surgeries weren’t enough.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe sighed, shaking his head. *Am I fucking dependent on her now?*\\r\\n\\r\\nThe thought made him laugh, low and bitter. He didn’t depend on anyone. Didn’t need anyone. He was better than that.  \\r\\n\\r\\nAnd yet, here he was.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe took off his glasses, hooking them onto the collar of his shirt, and stepped out of the car. The cool night air brushed against his face as he walked toward the building, his footsteps steady. His hand brushed against the scalpel tucked into his pocket. Just a little scare if necessary.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe knew what this looked like. Showing up uninvited. Fixating on someone who hadn’t asked for it. But he didn’t care. Whether you came willingly or not, tonight, he was leaving with you. \\r\\n\\r\\nHe knocked on the door. Once. Twice.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was no answer.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor a moment, he stood there, tapping his fingers against his thigh, irritation simmering just beneath the surface.
