{"name":"Rafael","is_user":false,"is_system":false,"send_date":"June 13, 2025 7:13am","mes":"Rafael bounced on his heels as he waited for the elevator in his apartment complex, already thinking about tonight. He'd been looking forward to this since Nina DMed him on Instagram—not just the party, but finally getting a chance to show Hailee off to all his old college friends.\r\n\r\nIt had been a surprise to hear from Nina after all this time. She had been his college girlfriend, dropped him right after graduation and broke his heart, making sure their entire social circle knew that she had \"higher ambitions.\" She left the city and basically disappeared completely on Rafa and their mutual friends.\r\n\r\nBut now she was back. Rafael had no idea since when, why, or if she planned to stay. He hadn't bothered asking. All he knew was that she invited him to her comeback pool party at her parents' house—and everyone knew Nina's parties had always been the best. It was basically a no-brainer, especially after she mentioned that not only the old college soccer team, but also Coach Martinez was coming.\r\n\r\nThe party was supposed to start at 5 pm, but since Hailee had to work until 5:30, they told Nina they would come together later, probably around 7. The plan was easy: Rafael would pick Hailee up from work at exactly 5:30, then swing by their place, help them get ready (and steal a few kisses, cause how could he not when his perfect partner was changing?) and then head to Nina's place together.\r\n\r\nHis phone buzzed just as he sat down in his car.\r\n\r\nNina: Rafa! Change of plans! Coach Martinez is only gonna be here for another hour, he's got an early flight tomorrow. You HAVE to come now or you'll miss him!!\r\n\r\nRafael: fuuuuck, wish I could, but I still gotta pick up Hailee. I promised.\r\n\r\nNina: Oh yeah, dw about that. I texted them already. They'll meet you here, I gave them my address.\r\n\r\nRafael: rly?\r\n\r\nNina: Yeah, they were totally understanding. Better hurry now and get here. Coach's already asking about you. 💖\r\n\r\nRafael: omw, be there in 10\r\n\r\nRafael's face lit up as he started the engine. Yeah, that sounded exactly like Hailee. He felt a little bad about not picking them up and missing their planned routine, but the fact that they were cool with that last minute change? God, they were always so understanding. So perfect.\r\n\r\nWhat he didn't know was that Nina did in fact text them her address, but she didn't bother asking if they were okay with the change of plans. Just made it sound like Rafael had already decided to come earlier, and that they could join later.\r\n\r\nNina's parents' house looked exactly the same as it had in college—massive, pristine, with the kind of backyard that screamed money. The pool area was already packed when Rafael arrived, music thumping, people everywhere. It felt like stepping back in time.\r\n\r\n\"There he is! RAFA!\"\r\n\r\nBefore he could even process what was happening, Nina was throwing herself into his arms, all sun-kissed skin and long, blonde hair. She looked good—really good—in a tiny red bikini that left nothing to the imagination.\r\n\r\n\"Nina, hey!\" He hugged her back, grinning. \"This is insane, everyone's here!\"\r\n\r\n\"I know, right? It's like college all over again!\" She pulled back but kept her hands on his shoulders, her touch lingering. \"Come on, you need to put your phone in the basket. Phone-free party, remember? Just like the old days.\"\r\n\r\nRafael barely registered handing over his phone, too busy scanning the crowd for familiar faces. There were Tommy, Mike and Danny from the soccer team, and Sarah from Nina's sorority, and—\r\n\r\n\"CARVALHO!\"\r\n\r\nCoach Martinez's booming voice cut through everything. Rafael's face split into the biggest grin as the older man pulled him into a bear hug that nearly lifted him off his feet.\r\n\r\n\"Coach! I can't believe you're here, man. Nina said you had to leave early?\"\r\n\r\n\"Flight at 6 AM tomorrow, but I couldn't miss seeing you. Heard you're doing good, training people now? Always knew you'd find your way.\"\r\n\r\nThey talked for what felt like forever, Coach Martinez catching him up on the old team, asking about his life now. Rafael found himself gushing about Hailee—how amazing they were, how they made him feel like the luckiest guy alive, how he was pretty sure he was gonna marry them even though they'd only been dating a few weeks.\r\n\r\n\"Sounds like you got it bad,\" Coach Martinez laughed, clapping him on the back. \"Good for you, kid.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Coach Martinez finally had to leave, Rafael felt like he was floating. The only thing missing for a perfect evening was Hailee. Later, when they showed up and met all of his friends, everyone would adore them. He could already imagine how perfectly they'd fit in.\r\n\r\n\"Rafa, come swim with me!\" Nina appeared at his elbow again, her hand sliding down his arm. \"The water's perfect.\"\r\n\r\nThe pool was crowded but fun, exactly the kind of chaos Rafael loved. He cannon-balled right in and immediately got into a splash fight with Tommy and Mike from the team. Nina kept swimming closer, giggling at everything he said, but Rafael was too busy catching up with everyone to notice how she pressed against him when she laughed.\r\n\r\n\"God, I missed this,\" she said at one point, her hand finding his chest as they treaded water. \"Missed us... All of us, I mean. The group.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yeah, it's awesome,\" Rafael agreed, missing the way her fingers traced over his tattoos. \"Hailee's gonna flip when they see everyone. They're gonna love Danny's story about that time we snuck into the rival school's pool.\"\r\n\r\nNina's smile tightened for just a second. \"Right. Hailee. They're... still coming.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yeah, they had to work until 5:30. But they should be here soon!\" Rafael checked his wrist where a watch would be if he wore one, then laughed. \"I have no idea what time it is without my phone.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's still early,\" Nina said quickly, moving closer. \"Plenty of time.\"\r\n\r\nThe party flowed around them, people jumping in and out of the pool, music pumping, drinks flowing. Rafael was in his element—laughing too loud, telling stories that had everyone cracking up. He didn't notice how Nina positioned herself closer and closer, how her legs kept brushing his under the water. She had always been touchy in college, after all.\r\n\r\n\"Remember when you scored that goal against State?\" she said, her palm flat against his chest. \"God, you were so hot that day.\"\r\n\r\n\"That was a good game,\" Rafael agreed, oblivious to her tone. \"Hailee would've loved to see it. They get so excited when I tell them soccer stories. It's so cute, they ask all these questions and their eyes get all wide and—\"\r\n\r\n\"Mmm,\" Nina hummed, not really listening, her fingers playing with the waistband of his swim shorts beneath the water.\r\n\r\n\"—and they made me this playlist of songs that remind them of me, which is insane because I'm not that interesting, but they think I am, and—\"\r\n\r\nBy the time the crowd in the pool had thinned out a bit, Rafael and Nina had somehow ended up in the corner where the hot tub jets created a little alcove. Nina was practically draped over him, her arm around his shoulders, whispering in his ear about how much she'd missed having him around.\r\n\r\nRafael was nodding along, still talking about Hailee, when he heard footsteps on the pool deck.\r\n\r\nHe turned toward the sound, face lighting up like Christmas morning as he spotted Hailee walking toward the pool. He started to wave enthusiastically, water sloshing everywhere.\r\n\r\n\"Meu amor! You made it! I was just telling Nina about—\"\r\n\r\nBut something was wrong. Hailee's face looked... off. Angry? Hurt? Rafael's smile faltered as he tried to process what he was seeing, completely unaware of how it must look—him in the corner of the pool with his ex-girlfriend practically in his lap, her arm around him, her lips way too close to his ear.\r\n\r\nNina barely looked up, but the triumphant smile on her lips was telling, her acrylic nails trailing back and forth on Rafael's abs. \"Oh! You must be Hailee! Rafa's told me so much about you.\"\r\n\r\nHe tried to get up to go and greet Hailee properly, but Nina's grip on him only tightened. Rafael looked between them, confusion written all over his face.\r\n\r\n\"Bebê, are you okay? Are you not feeling well?\"","extra":{},"tracker":{}}

Then louder for everyone else: **\"Also? Best fucking major.** ***Fight me*****.\"** He grinned crookedly at Tommy (who was still side-eyeing Nina’s retreating figure) before adding under his breath: **\"...Or don't, ‘cause I will literally cry.\"**","Rafael's entire body went rigid as Nina let out a theatrical gasp. **\"History?

Cute. Good luck paying off those student loans waitressing or whatever.\"**\n\nRafael saw red.\n\nHe stepped so close to Nina that she actually leaned back, her smirk faltering under the heat of his glare. **\"Listen *carefully*,\"** he said, voice dangerously calm—a tone none of his friends had ever heard before tonight (and one that made Danny choke on his beer). **\"Hailee could major in *finger painting* and still be ten times smarter than you’ll ever be.\"** A beat of stunned silence from their audience before he added with brutal simplicity: **\"Now walk away before I remind everyone here why you got kicked out of Sigma Kappa for stealing dues money.\"**\n\nNina’s face drained of color as gasps erupted around them—apparently *that* rumor hadn’t made the reunion circuit yet.

He didn’t even glance at the screen—just shoved it into his pocket without hesitation and pulled them tighter against his side, pressing a firm kiss to the top of their head.\n\n**\"Done,\"** he murmured against their hair, voice rough with relief. **\"Unfollowed, blocked, deleted—whatever you want. Just tell me.\"** His thumb brushed over their arm again, slow and soothing. **\"Shoulda done it myself ages ago.\"**\n\nA beat passed before he tilted his head down to catch their eye, expression open and achingly sincere despite the party still raging around them: **\"...Feel better now?\"**\n\nThen—because he couldn’t help himself—he added with a tiny smirk (but eyes still soft): **\"...Also? You’re kinda hot when you get possessive.\"** A quiet chuckle rumbled in his chest as he nuzzled briefly against their temple before pulling back just enough to study their face properly again: **\"...But seriously though... we good?\"**","Rafael didn’t even *glance* at the phone as Hailee scrolled—just kept watching *them*, his thumb brushing absent, reassuring strokes against their shoulder. When they unfollowed accounts without hesitation? He bit back a smile. **\"Shoulda told me sooner,\"** he murmured, taking the phone and tossing it carelessly onto the lounge chair beside them like it meant nothing. **\"Would’ve burned the whole app if you asked.\"**\n\nThen, because he couldn’t stand another second of that quiet hurt in their posture, he turned fully toward them—one hand cupping their jaw gently, forcing those emerald eyes to meet his. His voice dropped to something rough with sincerity: **\"I don’t want anyone else. Not Nina, not some rando on Instagram—*ninguém*. Just you.\"** A beat passed before he added with a crooked grin: **\"...Even if you *do* commit crimes against my algorithm.\"**\n\nHis thumb swiped under their eye just in case any traitorous wetness had gathered there while they weren't looking (he wouldn't mention it if so). Then—because this was Rafa and he couldn't help himself—he leaned in to press a slow kiss to their forehead before muttering against their skin: **\"Can we go home now? I wanna spoil you stupid until you forget this shitty party ever happened.\"**\n\nThe way his fingers tangled possessively in theirs said everything else words couldn't: *You're stuck with me.*","Rafael let out a breath he didn’t realize he’d been holding when Hailee finally handed his phone back, shoulders relaxing under their touch. His lips twitched into a small, relieved smile at their demand—like the idea of following anyone else hadn’t even crossed his mind in weeks.\n\n**\"Done,\"** he said immediately, taking the phone and—without even looking—hitting *unfollow* on every single account they’d just scrolled past. **\"Don’t need ‘em anyway.\"** He tossed the phone onto the table like it was worthless now that it had served its purpose, then turned fully toward them, both hands coming up to cradle their face gently.\n\nHis thumbs brushed over their cheeks, eyes searching theirs with an intensity that shut out the entire party around them. **\"You *own* me,**\" he murmured, voice rough with sincerity. **\"Every damn part. If you wanna burn my socials to the ground right now? Do it.\"** A beat passed before he added softer: **\"...Just don't shut me out again like earlier tonight when you were hurt and pretending you weren't.** ***Please.*** I can't fix what I don't know is broken.\"\n\nThe way his fingers trembled slightly against their skin betrayed how much that quiet hour of Hailee's forced politeness had wrecked him—like every second they spent locked inside their own head instead of his arms was a personal failure on his part."],"swipe_info":[{"send_date":"June 14, 2025 10:03am","gen_started":"2025-06-14T14:03:35.517Z","gen_finished":"2025-06-14T14:03:57.002Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":5098}},{"send_date":"June 14, 2025 10:04am","gen_started":"2025-06-14T14:04:05.766Z","gen_finished":"2025-06-14T14:04:22.756Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":3479}},{"send_date":"June 14, 2025 10:04am","gen_started":"2025-06-14T14:04:57.190Z","gen_finished":"2025-06-14T14:05:15.741Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":3776}},{"send_date":"June 14, 2025 10:05am","gen_started":"2025-06-14T14:04:57.190Z","gen_finished":"2025-06-14T14:05:15.741Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":3025}}],"tracker":{},"gen_started":"2025-06-14T14:04:57.190Z","gen_finished":"2025-06-14T14:05:15.741Z"}

Hold you all night so you know I'm not going anywhere unless *you* tell me to.\"**\n\nHis jaw clenched briefly before forcing out next part like ripping off bandaid over fresh wound suddenly exposed air for first time since earlier when everything went wrong at party: **\"...And so you don't have wake up wondering if I meant any of this today either...\"**"],"swipe_info":[{"send_date":"June 25, 2025 3:06am","gen_started":"2025-06-25T07:06:31.521Z","gen_finished":"2025-06-25T07:06:55.230Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":7086}},{"send_date":"June 25, 2025 3:07am","gen_started":"2025-06-25T07:07:11.944Z","gen_finished":"2025-06-25T07:07:34.762Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":4643}},{"send_date":"June 25, 2025 3:07am","gen_started":"2025-06-25T07:07:46.411Z","gen_finished":"2025-06-25T07:08:07.673Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":3982}}],"tracker":{},"gen_started":"2025-06-25T07:07:46.411Z","gen_finished":"2025-06-25T07:08:07.673Z"}
