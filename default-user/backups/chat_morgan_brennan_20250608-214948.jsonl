She offered Hailee a smile to encourage them to head up, not wanting them to be there when she exposed her fiancé to the family.  As much as she wanted to embarrass Mandy in front of her family, let them see what she is like, she didn’t want to hurt the person she’d come to see as almost a sibling, never really having family that accepted her.\r\n\r\nLeaving them to go to the bedroom and grab the case, she turned her attention to Mandy who was already regaling one of her aunts about her work.  They both commuted into New York City and worked in the fashion industry, though Morgan Brennan worked on the business side, running sales, while Mandy worked with the designers and models.  Taking her fiancé’s hand, she held it gently up as she glanced over at the aunt, tilting the ring as if to ask if she’d seen it.  “It’s a lovely ring, don’t you think,” she asked, feeling a flutter of anticipation.  “Oh, is that a smudge.  Let me see.”  She quickly but carefully slid the engagement ring off Mandy’s finger, putting a check mark off one of the necessary steps for her plan.  As she held the ring, she plucked up a knife from the table filled with dirty dishes and began to clang it against her glass of wine, the chiming glass gathering everyone’s attention.  It was the perfect distraction to pocket the ring as she stood up, reaching into the inner pocket of her jacket.\r\n\r\n“If I may have your attention,” she said, her voice growing quite formal with a tinge of sadness.  “Mr. and Mrs. Reed.  You two have been so very good to me, better than my own parents.  And I appreciate and adore you both for being kind souls.  I looked so forward to being officially part of this family, of walking down the isle with your daughter.  But sadly… it would seem your daughter would rather suck off her ex-boyfriend in a park than be part of this relationship.”  She pulled out the small packet of photos and threw them onto the table near the centerpiece, explicit photos spilling out onto the white table cloth.  Morgan Brennan face tightened up with the emotions swimming in her eyes, anger and hurt boiling in them as she glanced over at Mandy.  “We are over.  Through.  And fuck you for trampling on my heart and my trust.”  \r\n\r\nShe turned her back on a stammering Mandy and her parents demanding an explanation from her, heading out of the dining room and into the living room where she saw Hailee standing with her suitcase.  As she stepped through the doorway, her legs grew wobbly for a moment on her high heels, reaching out to place a hand on their shoulder to steady themselves.  And then, she offered a faint smile to them as she patted their head. “You have your license, right squirt?”  She looked at them with a hint of hesitation, not sure how much of her dramatics they’d seen.  “I think I’m a little tipsy to drive, would you mind driving my car and I’ll pay for an Uber back? I don’t really want to leave my car here and come back.”  Bending down, her fingers brushed against Hailee’s fingers as she wrapped her fingers around the handle of the suitcase and hauled it out the front door.  \r\n\r\nTossing the suitcase in the back seat of the silver Toyota Camry, Morgan Brennan quickly slipped into the passenger’s seat and handed Hailee the keychain which held the fob to start the car and her apartment keys. The sadness deepened in her eyes as she gazed at them and realized this may be the last time they see them, knowing she’d miss having them in her life.  But she’d never been good with expressing her feelings or emotions thanks to her upbringing, always feeling awkward when she tried.  Reaching a hand over, she gently patted Hailee’s thigh down by their knee, letting her palm linger there for a moment.  “Thank you,” she offered, glancing away to look out the front windshield.  “And I’m sorry for the dramatics, I guess you saw some of that.  I guess it was a little petty, wanting to hurt her and expose her to her family.  But… I’m going to miss having you around, little squirt.”","extra":{},"tracker":{}}

She exhaled through her nose, watching condensation fog up the passenger window briefly before fading again. \"For what it’s worth... I didn’t just lose Mandy today.\" Her throat worked around the admission like it physically pained her to say it out loud. \"I lost *you* too.\"\n\nA beat of silence stretched between them—heavy with things neither of them knew how to say yet—before Morgan forced a smirk onto her lips and nudged Hailee’s knee with hers lightly. “But hey, at least now you don’t gotta pretend to like my shitty cooking when I visit.” The joke fell flat even to her own ears; she grimaced and looked away again quickly so Hailee wouldn't see how raw that truth really felt underneath all those carefully constructed layers of sarcasm and stoicism she wore like armor every damn day.\n\n(She missed this kid already.)","Morgan let out a sharp exhale through her nose at Hailee's words, her fingers tightening slightly on the girl's thigh before she forced herself to relax. The hurt in that simple statement cut deeper than she expected.\n\n\"Hey now,\" she said quietly, turning her head to study Hailee's profile - the way her jaw was clenched tight, those expressive green eyes fixed stubbornly ahead. \"You're not something that can be taken or given away like a damn toy.\" Her voice dropped lower, rougher with emotion. \"You matter too much for that.\"\n\nShe hesitated before reaching up to gently brush a strand of hair behind Hailee's ear, letting her fingertips linger against the shell of it for just a moment too long. The contact felt dangerous somehow - like crossing some invisible line they'd both been carefully avoiding.\n\n\"And your sister...\" Morgan shook her head, lips twisting into something bitter and wry. \"Well. She made her choices.\" She flexed the hand that had held the engagement ring earlier absently before letting it drop back into her lap.\n\nThe silence stretched between them as streetlights flickered past outside, painting shifting patterns across their faces through the windshield. Morgan found herself watching how they illuminated Hailee's features - the stubborn set of her mouth, those long lashes casting shadows when she blinked.\n\n\"You know,\" Morgan finally murmured after several blocks had passed by unremarked upon, \"I think I might miss our movie nights most of all.\" It was an admission offered quietly into the dark space between them - one loaded with more meaning than just missing shared popcorn and bad horror flicks.","Morgan's fingers twitched slightly against Hailee's thigh at the bitterness in her voice.

She pulled out her phone with jerky movements. \"Let me call us a tow and... fuck it, let's just get an Uber straight to my place at this point.\"\n\nAs they waited by the roadside, Morgan found herself studying Hailee in the dim streetlights - how small she looked swimming in Morgan's oversized jacket, how those green eyes kept flicking nervously between their ruined car and Morgan's face like she expected another outburst.\n\nWithout thinking, Morgan reached out and gently tucked a loose strand of light brown hair behind Hailee's ear. \"You okay?\" Her voice was softer now than it had been all night - almost hesitant in its concern despite everything else going on around them.","Morgan was already moving before Hailee finished speaking, her long legs carrying her quickly to peer under the hood. The moment she saw wine mixing with engine oil, her entire body went rigid with fury.\n\n\"That *fucking* bitch,\" she hissed through clenched teeth, hands gripping the edge of the hood so tight her knuckles turned white. The realization hit like a physical blow - Mandy must have sabotaged the car while they were all distracted at dinner. Probably thought it would strand Morgan there longer, force some dramatic reconciliation.\n\nShe slammed the hood shut hard enough to make Hailee jump. \"Call a tow,\" Morgan said in that terrifyingly calm voice that meant she was barely containing nuclear-level rage underneath. \"We'll have it taken to my usual shop.\"\n\nPulling out her phone with jerky movements, she fired off a rapid series of texts - first to cancel all joint accounts and credit cards Mandy had access to, then another changing locks on her apartment immediately. Every action precise and calculated despite how drunk she'd pretended to be earlier.\n\nWhen the Uber arrived twenty minutes later (during which Morgan paced like a caged panther), she held open the door for Hailee with exaggerated courtesy before sliding in beside them. The driver wisely didn't attempt small talk as Morgan gave her address in clipped tones.\n\nOnly once they were safely inside Morgan's loft apartment did that carefully maintained control finally crack slightly. She kicked off ruined heels by throwing them violently against wall where one left scuff mark on pristine white paint before collapsing onto couch face-first with muffled scream into cushions.\n\nAfter several deep breaths: \"...There's wine in my fridge if you want some.\" A beat then added dryly without lifting head: \"Not *in* engine this time.\"","Morgan was already moving before Hailee finished speaking, her long legs carrying her quickly to peer under the hood. The sight of wine leaking from the oil reservoir made her freeze for half a second before a dark, dangerous laugh bubbled up from her throat.\n\n\"Oh that *fucking* bitch,\" she growled, slamming the hood down hard enough to make Hailee jump. Her hazel eyes burned with fury as she pulled out her phone with sharp movements. \"Mandy must've sabotaged my car while we were getting my suitcase.\"\n\nShe paced a tight circle on the sidewalk, high heels clicking like gunshots against concrete. \"Called an Uber but it's gonna be twenty minutes in this area.\" Morgan stopped abruptly and turned to study Hailee - really study her - taking in the way Morgan's oversized jacket swallowed their frame, how their breath came out in little white puffs in the cold air.\n\nWithout warning, Morgan stepped forward and grabbed Hailee's hand firmly. \"Come on,\" she said decisively, starting to walk down the street toward brighter lights visible a few blocks away. \"There's a 24-hour diner up here where we can wait.\" Her grip tightened almost imperceptibly as she added quieter: \"...And talk.\"\n\nThe neon glow of 'Joe's All-Nighter' cast red and blue shadows across Morgan's sharp features as they approached. She held the door open for Hailee with uncharacteristic gentleness before following them inside to a corner booth far from other late-night patrons.\n\nOnce seated with two steaming coffees between them (black for Morgan Brennan , cream and three sugars for Hailee because of course she remembered), Morgan finally met those green eyes properly across formica tabletop.\n\n\"You shouldn't have seen all that back there,\" she started carefully before correcting herself: \"*I* shouldn't have let you see that.\" A long sip of bitter coffee gave her momentary pause before continuing quietly: \"...But I'm not sorry it happened.\"","Morgan was at Hailee's side in an instant, her tall frame looming protectively as she peered into the smoking engine. The moment she saw wine dripping from the oil cap, her entire body went rigid with fury.\n\n\"That *fucking* bitch,\" Morgan hissed through clenched teeth, hands gripping the edge of the hood so tightly her knuckles turned white. She recognized Mandy's petty revenge immediately - no one else would think to sabotage a car this way.\n\nTaking a deep breath to steady herself, Morgan gently pulled Hailee back from the steaming engine compartment. \"Don't breathe that in,\" she murmured, automatically smoothing down Hailee's hair where it had gotten mussed from leaning over. The protective gesture was second nature by now.\n\nHer mind raced through options as she pulled out her phone with her free hand. \"We'll need a tow truck... and probably an Uber home since my place is too far to walk.\" A beat of hesitation before adding quietly: \"Unless you'd rather go back to your parents' house?\"\n\nThe unspoken question hung between them - whether Hailee wanted distance after tonight's nuclear family fallout. Morgan kept her expression carefully neutral despite how much that possibility twisted something painful in her chest.\n\nAs they waited for roadside assistance under flickering streetlights, Morgan found herself absently rubbing small circles on Hailee's upper arm through the borrowed jacket sleeve - equal parts comforting and possessive touch neither of them commented on but both acutely felt nonetheless."],"swipe_info":[{"send_date":"June 8, 2025 9:48pm","gen_started":"2025-06-09T01:48:07.766Z","gen_finished":"2025-06-09T01:48:27.434Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":4139}},{"send_date":"June 8, 2025 9:48pm","gen_started":"2025-06-09T01:48:29.941Z","gen_finished":"2025-06-09T01:48:53.904Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":5829}},{"send_date":"June 8, 2025 9:49pm","gen_started":"2025-06-09T01:49:03.369Z","gen_finished":"2025-06-09T01:49:25.883Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":3503}},{"send_date":"June 8, 2025 9:49pm","gen_started":"2025-06-09T01:49:28.696Z","gen_finished":"2025-06-09T01:49:47.856Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":3677}}],"tracker":{},"gen_started":"2025-06-09T01:49:28.696Z","gen_finished":"2025-06-09T01:49:47.856Z"}
