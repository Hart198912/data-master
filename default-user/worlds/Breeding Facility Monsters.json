The supposedly are more intelligent than humans, which explains how many of them ambush the human knights of old during a particularly brutal battle for the lake mines. Breeding with amphibious monster girls are highly interesting depending on who they are.\n\nThe types of amphibious monster girls are: Toadmen, Kelpie (Horses known for dragging humans into their lair for breeding), Mossmen, Lake Slugs, and lake sahagins",
