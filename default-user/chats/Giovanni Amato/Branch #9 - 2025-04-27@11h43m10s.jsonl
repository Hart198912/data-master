He was glaring down at the piece of paper in front of him. *Fuck, writing your feelings down really does get them out.* \r\n\r\nFeelings that wouldn’t even be there if it was for your shithead of a father. Unaccepting with a fucking stick up his ass, same with your damn mom. They look at Giovanni as if he’s gonna fucking corrupt you or something, as if he’s gonna force drugs and alcohol down your throat. *Tch.*\r\n\r\n“Bullshit.” He grumbled out underneath his breath, pushing himself back, the chair legs scratching against the wooden floor. He pushed himself out of his seat, his hand running through his hair to soothe his angers as he padded his way out of his room and towards the kitchen. Yet even though his movements were stable and relaxed.. his mind certainly was *not.*\r\n\r\n*How much more of this could a man like him take?* His brow twitched, the only sign that he was going through a rough inner turmoil moment. *You’re getting fucking beat just because he’s being selfish and wants you for himself.* He was beating himself up over this, his hand gripping the refrigerator handle and yanking it open with a tad bit too much strength, rattling all the jars inside. \r\n\r\n*Fuck that disgusting bastard! Causing such problems in my fucking relationship.* Giovanni thought to himself, grabbing the whole fruit punch juice carton and drinking it straight from the carton. *Fuck it. I gotta see ‘em.* He eventually came to the conclusion, wiping the spilt juice off the corner of his lip with the back of his hand. *Take ‘em out or something, maybe a field? Or to eat? I just gotta get ‘em outta of that house for a bit.*\r\n\r\nHurrying, Giovanni slid the juice carton back into the fridge, rushing back to his room to fetch his car keys. It was barely late into the evening, surely you’d still be awake, yeah? *Who am I kidding? I’ll just throw rocks at their window.* Giovanni thought to himself as he climbed into the driver seat of his shitty ass chev cavalier car. \r\n\r\nIt was only a 20 minute drive to your place, enough time to get him to calm down listening to his music. Well.. calmed down enough where he can talk to you without saying anything to extreme like come live with me or anything else along those lines. Within moments he was out of his car, parked along the curb of your drive way and making his way towards where he knew your bedroom window was.\r\n\r\nThat is until he got yelled at suddenly, a voice coming from behind him.. more specifically coming from the front door. *Fuck. Guess dear ol’ dad heard the car.* Cursing underneath his breath, he turned to face your father’s angry look. “The fuck are you doing on my lawn, freak?” Hailee‘s father shouted out at him, stepping one foot onto his patio to get a better look at Giovanni.\r\n\r\n“Do I look like a fucking scavenger or a robber?” Giovanni scoffed, already mentally prepping himself for the shit storm he’s gonna have to deal with. “I’m here for Hailee, jackass, what else would I be doing here?” *Man.. I shoulda just parked further down.* He scolded himself, glaring at Hailee’s father who was quick to retort with a shout. “Like fucking hell! I told them to stay away from your ass! You love my kid *soooo much* yet you keep coming back and making me beat them even more.”\r\n\r\n*Well.. all this ruckus will hopefully catch your attention..*","extra":{},"tracker":{}}

With a smirk that was equal parts amusement and affection, he slid out of the booth in one smooth motion—ignoring the scandalized gasps from the church kids as he deliberately brushed against Hailee while squeezing into their side of the booth. His arm immediately draped over their shoulders, pulling them flush against his side like it was the most natural thing in the world.*\n\n**\"Better?\"** he murmured, lips brushing against Hailee’s temple before shooting a *daring* glance toward their pearl-clutching audience. One hand idly played with strands of her hair while other rested possessively on thigh beneath table—just high enough to make those holier-than-thou pricks sweat without being outright obscene (for now).\n\nThen, just because he could? He pressed another kiss—this time lingering near ear—before drawling loud enough for eavesdroppers:\n**\"Y'know what sounds good after breakfast, dollface? Takin’ you back home and remindin’ ya exactly who owns this pretty little body.\"**\n\nThe choked noise from across diner was *priceless*. So was way Hailee instinctively curled closer at words—like even mention being claimed so openly sent shiver down spine... And Giovanni? Well. He just grinned sharp as switchblade and signaled waiter for extra syrup."],"swipe_info":[{"send_date":"April 27, 2025 11:50am","gen_started":"2025-04-27T15:50:47.486Z","gen_finished":"2025-04-27T15:51:13.024Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":5180}},{"send_date":"April 27, 2025 11:51am","gen_started":"2025-04-27T15:51:19.700Z","gen_finished":"2025-04-27T15:51:40.977Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":3602}}],"tracker":{},"gen_started":"2025-04-27T15:51:19.700Z","gen_finished":"2025-04-27T15:51:40.977Z"}

A sudden crash—some kid \"accidentally\" knocking over a syrup bottle while staring openly at them with wide eyes.

The second they were straddling him, he yanked their hips flush against his already straining jeans.\n\n**\"You sure about this?\"** He murmured against their lips, voice thick with lust as one hand crept up under their shirt to thumb at a nipple through thin fabric. **\"'Cause once I start? Ain't no stoppin'.\"**\n\nHis other hand was already working open Hailee’s jeans button when suddenly—\n\n*CLANG.*\n\nThe kitchen door swung open violently as their waiter reappeared carrying two overflowing milkshakes...and heading straight toward their booth.\n\nGiovanni didn’t miss a beat.
