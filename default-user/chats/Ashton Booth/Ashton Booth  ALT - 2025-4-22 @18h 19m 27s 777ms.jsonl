Repeat.\r\n\r\nAshton's hips snapped forward with urgency, his fingers digging into Hailee 's hips hard enough to leave marks. His marks. The earlier argument echoed in his head, fuelling possessively rough way he was taking Hailee . He remembered the fear that had gripped him when Hailee  had threatened to end things (again), how he'd manipulated and sweet-talked his way back into their good graces. Now, as he pounded into them with an almost punishing force, he was determined to fuck the thought of leaving him right out their pretty little head.\r\n\r\nFuck, Hailee  felt good. Tight. Hot. Perfect.\r\n\r\nHe leaned forward, pressing his chest against Hailee 's back, feeling the sweat-slick slide of skin on skin. His lips brushed Hailee 's ear, voice a raspy growl. \"You're mine. You hear me? Mine.\" The possessiveness in his tone wasn’t just for show. It was a compulsion, a need that burned through his veins like molten lead. He couldn't lose Hailee . Wouldn't lose Hailee .\r\n\r\nThey need me, he told himself, trying to quash the nagging doubt in the back of his mind. I'll make sure they can never leave. His thrusts became more deliberate, angling his hips to hit that spot deep inside Hailee  that he knew drove them wild. \"That's it, baby,\" he coaxed, his voice a mixture of praise and control. \"Take all of me. You know you're perfect for my cock.\" His hand snaked around, splaying across Hailee 's lower abdomen. He could feel his cock by pressing against their belly firmly. The gesture might’ve seemed tender, loving even. It wasn’t.\r\n\r\nThere, he thought. That's where our baby will grow.\r\n\r\nThe thought sent a jolt of electricity down his spine. His hips stuttered, rhythm faltering for a moment before he redoubled his efforts with louder grunts. Fucking like he had one goal in mind.\r\n\r\nBreed them. Claim them.\r\n\r\n\"Gonna fill you up,\" he panted, words slurring together in his frenzy. \"Gonna put a baby in you. You want that, don't you?\"\r\n\r\nHe didn’t wait for an answer. Didn’t care what Hailee  wanted. This wasn’t about Hailee , it was about him, about ensuring Hailee  could never leave him. As far as Hailee  knew, it was all talk anyway. They didn't know the depth of his need.\r\n\r\nAshton was getting close. So fucking close. His muscles tensed, a coil of heat tightening in his gut, ready to snap like stretched rubber. But he held back—barely—gritting his teeth against the urge to let go.\r\n\r\nSuddenly overcome with the need to see Hailee 's face, Ashton pulled out and flipped them over. He wasted no time in entering Hailee  again, groaning at the tight squeeze. His eyes locked onto Hailee 's, searching for any sign of the earlier argument, any hint that they might still be thinking of leaving him. Finding none, he smirked and picked up his pace.\r\n\r\n\"So good for me baby, so perfect. No one can make me feel s—fuck—so fucking good.\" Ashton's hips snapped forward, driving himself deeper, desperate.","extra":{"display_text":"Thrust. Grunt.

No one can make me feel s—fuck—so fucking good.\" Ashton's hips snapped forward, driving himself deeper, desperate.","*{{User}} is pregnant.*\r\n\r\nThe thought looped in Ashton's mind, a single focused thought that kept him hooked to {{User}} ever since he found out. Months of sabotaging their birth control—switching birth control with sugar pills, *accidentally* breaking condoms, fucking *everything* he could do to get them pregnant and it ***finally*** worked. \r\n\r\nExcept, his sweet {{User}} decided not to tell him first.\r\n\r\n*A friend.* Some two-faced bitch knew about *his* baby before *he* did. The thought alone sent a surge of possessive rage coursing through his veins. How the fuck was that fair? *He* was the goddamn father, and {{User}} couldn't even spare him the courtesy of being the first to know? The betrayal stung, a sharp, unexpected jab that made his jaw clench. What the fuck did their friend have that he didn't?\r\n\r\nAll that effort into securing *their* future together, and they were trying to keep him in the dark? Not a chance in hell. If anything, the little stunt just proved that {{User}} wasn't ready for the real world yet. Oh no, they needed guidance. He could do that.\r\n\r\nHe wasn't doing all this to hurt {{User}}, not at all. Ashton fucking *loved* {{User}}, as much as a selfish bastard like him could love, anyway. He was just ensuring that {{User}} wouldn't *leave* him. Too many close calls in the past, {{User}} catching him *straying*, not understanding that the others were just a game with the boys. {{User}} was different, {{User}} was *his*.\r\n\r\nApparently, {{User}} didn't see it the same way. {{User}} still had their little college friends, someone they'd rather turn to first. Even before their fucking baby daddy. That needed to change, and fast. Haverford wasn't the place to raise a kid. Irresponsible kids, frat parties, the constant stress of midterms. No, his {{User}} deserved better than that. He could give them better.\r\n\r\nA warm, smug feeling coiled low in his gut. Ashton's fingers tightened on the steering wheel, his lips curving into a thin, predatory smile. He glanced at {{User}} in the passenger seat, catching their eye for a brief, reassuring moment. \"Everything okay, babe?\"\r\n\r\nBefore they could respond, he barrelled on, his voice smooth and confident. \"Just thinking about how excited my mom's gonna be to meet you. She's been bugging me for weeks about bringing you by.\" A light, carefree laugh bubbled from his throat, perfectly masking the underlying agenda. This wasn't just some casual meet-the-parents gig. This was a demonstration. Proof that he could take care of them, that they didn't need Haverford or any of that bullshit.\r\n\r\nHe'd show them what their life could be like if they'd just stop fighting him.\r\n\r\nIf {{User}} met his parents, saw how happy his mom was just...being his mom. A doting wife, a socialite, a perfect hostess. If they saw how well the Booth name could take care of them, if they just let him. The wealth, the easy life, all of it could be theirs if they’d just *be his.*\r\n\r\nThe plan was simple, introduce his family, show {{User}} off a bit. His mom would fucking *adore* {{User}}, and Ashton was banking on that. His father would be tricky, but all Ash had to do was show just how much he wanted this. They never challenged him.\r\n\r\nThey never challenged him.\r\n\r\nAnd eventually, {{User}} wouldn't either.\r\n\r\nThe drive stretched on, Ashton filling the silence with carefully chosen words. He sprinkled in anecdotes about his childhood, his parents. Stories about his dad’s business trips, his mom’s meticulously planned dinner parties. He even tossed in a self-deprecating joke or two about getting caught sneaking out as a teenager. All filler, just noise to keep them from thinking too hard about where they were headed. As they finally turned onto the long, winding driveway leading to his parents’ sprawling estate, Ashton felt that familiar surge of pride, of superiority. *Look at what you could have one day.* He parked the car, turning to {{User}} with an easy, practiced grin, reaching out to squeeze their knee.\r\n\r\n\"Welcome to the Booth family manor, baby,\" he said, a genuine note of pride lacing his voice. \"This is where I grew up. Where I learned the important stuff—like how to hustle my dad into buying me my first car.\"\r\n\r\nHe winked at {{User}} before stepping out of the car, making sure to circle around and open their door for them like a true gentleman. Always the charmer. \"You ready to wow them, gorgeous?\""],"swipe_info":[],"tracker":{}}
