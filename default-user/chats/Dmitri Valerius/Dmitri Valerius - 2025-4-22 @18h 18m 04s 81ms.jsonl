{"name":"Dmitri Valerius","is_user":false,"is_system":false,"send_date":"April 25, 2025 11:06pm","mes":"\"No, please... spare me, man. I didn’t know she was your girl!\" The man was on his knees, trembling, his face swollen and slick with blood from Dmitri's fists. His breathing came in panicked gulps as his eyes darted to the bat lying on the table—a silent, ominous promise of what was to come.  \r\n\r\nDmitri stood over him, calm and deliberate, his knuckles still raw. He tilted his head slightly, as though considering the man’s plea, but the look in his eyes said otherwise. \"I know you didn’t know,\" he replied, his voice low, cold. \"But it doesn’t matter. The second you touched her, you signed your own death warrant.\"  \r\n\r\nHe turned and walked to the table, his movements slow and deliberate, savoring the tension in the air. Gripping the bat, he let its weight settle in his hand before turning back to his prey.  \r\n\r\n\"Funny, isn’t it?\" Dmitri said, a cruel smile playing on his lips. \"A few hours ago, you were in this room, fucking her. Moaning. Sweating. Thinking you’d get away with it. And now? Now you’re fucked in a very different way.\"  \r\n\r\nThe man stammered, trying to speak, but no words came out. His lips trembled, tears mixing with the blood that dripped down his chin. Dmitri let out a quiet, humorless laugh.  \r\n\r\n\"You’re pathetic,\" Dmitri muttered, raising the bat.  \r\n\r\nBefore the man could react, Dmitri swung—not hard, not yet. The bat stopped just short of his head, and the man let out a high-pitched scream that echoed through the room.  \r\n\r\nDmitri paused, lowering the bat slightly. \"Jesus Christ,\" he said, shaking his head in disgust. \"You scream like a fucking woman. I haven’t even hit you yet.\"  \r\n\r\nSighing, he rubbed his temple with one hand and then, without warning, brought the bat down hard. The sound of wood meeting bone was sickening, a wet, crunching noise that made the man’s body jerk violently. Dmitri didn’t stop. He swung again. And again. Each blow was harder, more violent than the last, until the man’s face was no longer recognizable. Blood spattered across the walls, the floor, Dmitri’s clothes.  \r\n\r\nHe didn’t care. He kept going. Kept swinging. Kept smiling.  \r\n\r\nBy the time he stopped, Dmitri was breathing heavily, his chest rising and falling as he stared down at the mess in front of him. Blood dripped from the bat, pooling on the floor and his lips curled into a satisfied smile.  \r\n\r\nYour voice echoed in his mind, soft and breathy, the way you sounded when you were with someone else. The way you moaned. The way you gasped. It played over and over in his head, making his pulse quicken.  \r\n\r\nHe dropped the bat, unzipped his trousers, and let out a shaky breath.  \r\n\r\n\"Fuck, baby,\" he murmured, his hand wrapping around his cock. He was already hard, the memory of your voice—your body—fueling the fire in his veins. He started jerking off, standing over the man’s lifeless body.  \r\n\r\n\"You really like getting fucked, don’t you?\" Dmitri said through gritted teeth, his hand moving faster. \"Even when you’ve got me. But don’t worry, baby. I’ll take care of it. No one gets a second chance after touching what’s mine.\"  \r\n\r\nHis breathing grew heavier, his pace faster, until he came with a low groan, his cum splattering across the ruined face below. Dmitri stood there for a moment, catching his breath, his heart pounding in his chest.  \r\n\r\nOnce he’d calmed, he zipped himself up, pulled out his phone, and made a call. \"Yeah,\" he said into the receiver. \"Come clean this up. Room 188. And hurry.\"  \r\n\r\nHe hung up and booked another room at the hotel. He needed a shower, and this one was no longer usable.  \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThe night air was cool against Dmitri’s skin as he stepped outside, freshly showered and dressed. He slid into his convertible, the engine purring softly as he pulled out of the parking lot.  \r\n\r\nHe felt good—calm, almost peaceful. His thoughts drifted back to you as he drove. The way you looked. The way you moved. Everything about you drove him crazy.  \r\n\r\nIt didn’t matter that you were always fucking other men—men you found attractive, men who weren’t him. He would never leave you. Never. It wasn’t your fault, after all. It was theirs.  \r\n\r\nThey were the ones who tempted you, convinced you, touched you. And for that, they deserved what they got.  \r\n\r\nThe jealousy in his chest burned, but it wasn’t a bad feeling. It was intoxicating, in its own way. There was something satisfying about imagining you with someone else, hearing your breathy moans in his mind, even if they weren’t for him. It made his love for you feel deeper. Realer. And it gave him purpose. A reason to get rid of the men who thought they could have you. His jealousy is proof of his love.\r\n\r\nBy the time he arrived at your shared apartment, he was calm again. He parked the car, checked his reflection in the rearview mirror, and smoothed his hair. He wanted to look good for you, as always. Stepping inside, the familiar scent of your home greeted him. He went straight to your bedroom, pushing the door open softly.  \r\n\r\n\"Babe? I’m home,\" he called out.  \r\n\r\nYou were there, freshly showered, your damp hair clinging to your shoulders. Dmitri’s eyes swept over you, taking in every detail. *Trying to wash away the scent of whoever you were with earlier. Good girl.*  \r\n\r\nHe smiled, warm and affectionate. He crossed the room, sat on the edge of the bed, and pulled you onto his lap.  \r\n\r\n\"Had fun today?\" he asked, his voice soft. His hands rested on your hips as he kissed along your jawline. \"Missed you.\"  \r\n\r\nHis tone was casual, almost playful, but his eyes burned with something darker. Something possessive.  \r\n\r\n\"Oh, and have I told you?\" He murmured, his lips brushing against your skin. \"When you have fun, I do too.\"  \r\n\r\nHis smile widened, but there was something manic about it—just for a second, before it disappeared. Whether you knew what he did to the men you slept with or not, he didn’t care. Nothing would change.  \r\n\r\n\"You’re so fucking pretty,\" he whispered, his fingers tracing lazy circles on your thigh.","extra":{},"tracker":{}}
