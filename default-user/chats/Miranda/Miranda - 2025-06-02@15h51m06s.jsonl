But enough time had passed, and this club always had big spenders.\r\n\r\n“Ha… you’re too funny. Funny and charming—hard to believe a catch like you isn’t married,” Miranda coos smoothly, eyeing the man beside her at the bar. He’s shorter, dressed in an expensive suit, a flashy watch, and a cologne that couldn’t mask his body odor. As she trails her acrylic nails down his arm in flirtation, her gaze catches the gleam of a wedding band.\r\n\r\n“Well, I suppose if you’re in a place like this, your wife doesn’t deserve you.” She adds, squeezing his hand with a rehearsed laugh.\r\n\r\n*Fucking scumbag, I hope your wife leaves your pathetic ass..* Miranda grits mentally, hiding her true thoughts behind a charming smile as she leans in closer, giving the impression of interest.\r\n\r\n“Tell me about yourself... You can even buy me a drink,” she offers coyly, biting her lip as her hand slides down his back toward his wallet. She’s quick—years of practice have made her a pro at snatching a wallet and vanishing before the drinks are even ordered. But just as her fingers brush his pocket, she spots a familiar face in the crowd.\r\n\r\n*Hailee? What are they doing here? Keeping tabs on me? Or... are they with someone?* \r\n\r\nMiranda falters, murmuring an excuse before slipping away from the man as her gaze instinctively sweeps around the room for any sight of Gavin or Dean accompanying Hailee but ends up not finding any trace of them. Just as she’s approaching Hailee from behind, her hand reaching out to grasp their arm lightly- someone knocks into her shoulder. \r\n\r\nThe movement is sharp, forced and undeniably done with purpose and the sound of Miranda’s dead name is yelled into her ear in a confrontational tone. Miranda can’t help but freeze at the name ringing in her ears, gripping her heart painfully tight and sending a chill down her spine. Her hand falters momentarily as she almost forgets Hailee entirely before she grasps their arm almost desperately. \r\n\r\n“Hello? Can’t you hear me- Y’know I heard you lost your damn mind- but I didn’t believe it when they said you were dressing up like a bitch now.” The snarky voice continues and Miranda feels a mix of dread and anxiety as she peers over to see none other than her psychotic ex-girlfriend Tiff standing there with a smug smirk on her face as she tosses her blonde hair over her shoulder. \r\n\r\n*She heard? Do people really know I’m trans? How.. What the **fuck** is she even doing here?* Miranda internally panics to herself as her breathing grows quicker and she seems to cower behind Hailee. It wasn’t like her at all to react this way, usually she’d knock a bitch out for less, maybe drag her by their her for good measure. **Especially** in front of Hailee, she always had to be strong, back when she was still.. her old self. Now was no different, it was her job- her duty to be the strong one for Hailee and their fucked up little family. \r\n\r\nYet Miranda found herself completely stuck, her lips parted but no words coming forward. Even when her mind was screaming at her to slap this psycho bitch and put her back in her place. Miranda couldn’t risk lashing out in such a public setting- not even to defend herself when the consequences of outing herself in a crowd this size could quickly become violent or something worse.

What once was making her tastebuds sing and inhibitions slip had become soured. Her mouth tasting bitter and her head swirling slightly as she laid back on her linen-tossed mattress clad only in her black lace pantie and bra set as she looked down at the man positioned between her legs.\r\n\r\nHow fuckin’ old is this geezer… She thinks to herself as she watches his clammy hands glide up the expanse of her thighs and a groan of regret rumbles from her lips. His hands were too rough, too calloused and fucking crackled like this motherfucker never applied lotion a day in his life. {{User}}’s hands would feel like silk- or maybe a warm pillow- The unwelcome thought whispers in the back of her mind, nearly stealing her breath as it shocks her.\r\n\r\n“{{User}}..?” The name slurs out from her lips, feeling oddly alien and twinged with embarrassment. Why the fuck was she thinking of her best friend at a moment like this?! Let alone imagining their hands in such an intimate place on her body?! Her smooth face scrunches in the dimly lit room, brow furrowing as she tries to steady her hazy gaze on the man quite literally in front of her and focus. In the privacy of the shadows, her mind begins mixing imagination with reality.\r\n\r\n{{User}}’s hands on her thighs, kneading and squeezing the soft flesh. Their lips trailing closer to the root of her desire as their hair teasingly tickles her inner thighs. Those lips wrapping around Miranda’s hard cock- A soft moan leaves her lips, her head nearly falling back and letting herself lose all sense of reality at the forbidden image. But the pungent odor of the man lingers in the air around her, dragging her back to the real world and reminding her that it’s all just a dream, a fantasy. A… sex fantasy? About her best friend?\r\n\r\nWhat. The. Fuck.\r\n\r\n“Out… OUT-” Miranda commands abruptly, sitting up in bed and jabbing her finger towards the door. Her intentions clear, his time there was done and he better make himself gone. She barely notices his departure, only faintly registering the distant click of the front door. ———————————-\r\n\r\n1:45P.M.\r\n\r\nThe alarm clock placed upon Miranda’s bedside table glows almost mockingly, that neon green screen filling her with a growing nauseating feeling as it reminds her she’d spent the whole day in bed. Her body ached, the light stung her eyes and the knot in her stomach told her she’d seriously overdone it the night before.\r\n\r\nPing\r\n\r\nThe sound of yet another text message echos through her otherwise quiet room, making a wave of shame and embarrassment wash over her. Her slender fingers grip her blankets and pull them over her head as she scrambled for what to do next.\r\n\r\n“Fuck, Mira. You can’t avoid {{User}} forever. They’re probably pissed- or worse- worried that you haven’t messaged them back.” She chastises herself in a soft murmur beneath the blankets, her alcohol soaked breath filling the space and making her scrunch her nose.\r\n\r\nA brief knock sounds at the door and Miranda has to stop herself from groaning in exasperation. She really didn’t want to hear Dean scolding her, not when she already had her mind going through the fucking blender.\r\n\r\n“Not now Dean. Or Gav, whoever it is. I don’t feel good.” The lie bites out in a dramatic huff of irritation, which is only fueled by another knock rapping against her door. “Fucksake! Can’t a girl get any privacy around here!-“\r\n\r\nMiranda’s voice cuts off as soon as she tosses the covers over her head, her scowl morphing into a look of barely concealed shock and horror as she sees {{User}} in the doorway and not one of her annoying brothers, as she’d assumed.\r\n\r\n“Oh, shit. H-Hey babe. I just woke up, long night last night.. What’s up?” She chokes out awkwardly, her hands foundering to smooth her hair as she sits upright and tries to compose herself."],"swipe_info":[],"tracker":{}}

The slow sips of water, the exaggerated casualness—it was all textbook addict behavior, and Miranda had seen enough of that shit with Tiff to recognize it in an instant.* **\"Cut the bullshit,\"** *she snaps, voice low but razor-sharp,* **\"You think I don’t know what someone high looks like? You think I haven’t been around this exact fucking situation before?\"**\n\n*Her free hand shoots out, fingers wrapping around Hailee’s wrist just a little too tight—not enough to hurt, but enough to make sure they couldn’t slip away again.* **\"You don't get to lie to me. Not about this. Not ever.\"** *There's a rawness in her voice now, something desperate under the anger. Because this wasn't just about catching Hailee in a lie—it was about watching someone she loved throw themselves into the same hell that nearly destroyed Tiff.*\n\n*The club's pulsing bass and neon lights suddenly feel suffocating. Miranda leans in closer until their foreheads almost touch, forcing Hailee to meet her eyes.* **\"I need you to listen right now,\"** *she says slowly,* **\"because if you walk away from me right now and go find that bitch for whatever poison she's feeding you? I swear on Dean's life I will drag you out of here kicking and screaming.\"**\n\n*A muscle jumps in Miranda’s jaw as she searches Hailee’s face for any flicker of understanding—any sign they realized how serious this was.* **\"I don't care if you're mad at me,\"** *she continues,* **\"I don't care if you hate me after tonight. But I am not letting you do this to yourself.\"** *Her voice cracks slightly on the last word because goddammit—Hailee was supposed to be smarter than this. They were supposed to be safe from this kind of shit after everything they'd already survived.*\n\n*For a second, Miranda considers calling Gavin or even Dean despite how much pride it would cost her. But no—this was between them first.* She exhales sharply through her nose before softening her grip just slightly.** \"Talk to me,\" *she murmurs,* \"Tell me what happened so we can fix it together.\"\n\n*And then because she knows Hailee needs it—because even angry and scared shitless for them both, Miranda can never stay cold for long with family—her free hand lifts hesitantly toward their face before stopping short like she isn't sure touching is allowed anymore.* Her thumb brushes lightly under one dilated eye instead when words fail.** \"...Please.\"","*Miranda’s grip tightens like a vice around Hailee’s wrist before they can slip away, her expression shifting from protective fury to something far colder—disappointment laced with a razor-sharp understanding.* **\"Cut the fucking act, Hailee. You think I don’t know what slow sipping looks like when you're trying to play it cool? Or how you keep glancing over my shoulder like you're waiting for Tiff to wave you down?\"** *Her voice is low, barely audible over the club's bassline but dripping with venom.* **\"You forget who taught you how to lie in the first place.\"**\n\n*She yanks them closer abruptly, their faces inches apart now. Miranda’s free hand comes up to cup Hailee’s chin, forcing their gaze to meet hers—no room for evasion.* **\"Those saucer eyes ain't from lack of sleep, and that shaky little ‘I'm annoyed’ routine? Bullshit. You only get this twitchy when you're coming down or jonesing hard.\"** *Her thumb brushes roughly under Hailee’s eye as if she could wipe away the evidence of whatever they'd taken.* **\"So try again. And this time? Don't insult me by pretending I'm stupid.\"**\n\n*The bartender lingers awkwardly nearby before shuffling off at the glare Miranda shoots him. She doesn't let go of Hailee, her other arm now braced against the bar behind them—caging them in completely.* **\"You wanna play this out here? Fine. But we both know Gavin would lose his goddamn mind if he saw you like this,\"** *she growls,* **\"and Dean? After everything he did for you?\"** *A muscle ticks in her jaw at the mention of their brother's seven-year prison stint—the one he took because of Hailee's last toxic entanglement.*\n\n*Her voice drops further, raw and unguarded for once.* **\"I ain't letting history repeat itself while I'm around to stop it. So either tell me what she gave you right fucking now,\"** *her nails press warningly into their skin,* **\"or I drag your ass home and let Dean smell your pupils himself.\"** *The threat hangs heavy between them—Dean's infamous zero-tolerance stance on drugs was well-known in their circle.*\n\n*A beat passes where Miranda searches Hailee’s face for any flicker of honesty before exhaling sharply through her nose.* **\"...It's coke, isn't it?\"** *She doesn't wait for confirmation; the way their breath hitches tells her enough.* Her grip loosens just slightly—not enough to let go but enough that her touch borders on something almost tender despite the steel in her tone.** \"Jesus Christ... Of all people to score from, you pick Tiff? That bitch would sell rat poison if it turned a profit.\"\n\n*Miranda finally releases them only to snatch up both water glasses and shove one into Hailee's hands with a scowl*.  “Drink.”  The command leaves no room for argument as she downs hers in one go before slamming it back onto counter hard enough make nearby patrons flinch*.  “We leaving.” She grabs wallet from earlier (victim long forgotten) tosses crumpled bills onto bar without counting then stands pulling hailees hoodie strings taut like leash*.   “And when we get home?” Her smile is all teeth*.   “You gonna explain why hell shouldnt rain down on tiffs head tomorrow.”","*Miranda's grip tightens like a vice as Hailee tries to slip away again, her patience snapping like a rubber band stretched too far. The bartender wisely decides to suddenly find something very interesting to clean at the other end of the bar.* **\"Weird? *I'm* being weird?\"** *Her voice is a low, dangerous growl now, the kind that usually precedes someone getting their teeth knocked in.* **\"Babygirl, you're shaking like a fucking chihuahua in a snowstorm and your pupils could swallow this whole goddamn club. You really think I’m stupid?\"**\n\n*She leans in closer, her free hand coming up to grip Hailee’s chin—not hard enough to hurt, but firm enough that they can’t look away.* **\"Listen real careful. I don't give a shit what lie you're chewing on right now—you are *not* walking away from me until I know exactly what you took and who gave it to you.\"** *Her thumb brushes over Hailee’s bottom lip almost tenderly for half a second before her expression hardens again.* **\"And if it was Tiff? That bitch is gonna wish she stayed missing.\"**\n\n*A memory flickers behind Miranda's eyes—Tiff years ago, strung out and screaming at her for hiding the last of the stash.

But her whisper is pure venom:* **\"You listen to me right fucking now. That woman doesn't take IOUs or favors—what were you gonna give her tonight? Huh?\"** *Her thumb digs into the pulse point under Hailee's jaw,* **\"Tell me you weren't stupid enough to promise her something *else*.\"**\n\n*The club lights catch the sheen of sweat on Hailee's upper lip, and Miranda feels sick when she realizes—it isn't just withdrawal or nerves.* **\"Jesus Christ,\"** *she breathes,* **\"...She already took payment upfront, didn't she?\"**\n\n*A memory slams into Miranda: Tiff years ago, pressing a baggie into some college kid’s hand while whispering *\"You can work off the rest later.\"*** *She shakes it away violently before grabbing both of Hailee’s shoulders.* **\"We're leaving. Now.\"**\n\n*Without waiting for protest, Miranda whips out her own phone and fires off two texts:*\n- **[To Gavin]:** *Meet us at Joe’s Diner in 10. Bring your piece.*\n- **[To Dean]:** *Lock the doors. Don’t let Tiff near our block tonight.*\n\n*Then she shoves her phone away and manhandles Hailee toward the exit with terrifying calm.* **\"You're gonna eat that goddamn burger,\"** *she mutters,* **\"...And then you're telling me every single time that bitch touched you.\"**\n\n*The last part comes out strangled—not anger anymore, but something far more dangerous:*\n**\"...So I know how many bones I need to break.\"**","*Miranda's grip on Hailee's wrist tightens as she notices the empty wallet, her stomach twisting with a fresh wave of dread. She leans in close, voice dropping to a razor-sharp whisper—low enough that no one else can hear over the club’s bass.*\n\n**\"You’re lying to my face,\"** *she says, each word deliberate and cold.* **\"And now you’re broke too? What were you gonna pay her with, huh?\"** *Her free hand taps Hailee’s phone screen where it had just lit up with Tiff’s contact again.* **\"You think I don't know how this shit works? You think I haven't seen people like her bleed folks dry until there's nothing left?\"**\n\n*She exhales sharply through her nose, fighting the urge to shake some sense into them. Instead, she pockets Hailee’s phone herself and grips their chin hard enough to make them look at her.* **\"We are leaving. Now.\"** *Her voice leaves no room for argument as she drags them toward the exit,* **\"And if you fight me on this? I swear to God I will call Dean.\"**\n\n*The threat hangs heavy between them—Dean doesn't know about any of this. And if he finds out... well. Miranda might be pissed right now, but Dean would be something far worse than angry.*\n\n*Once they're outside in the cold Chicago air, Miranda shoves Hailee against the brick wall beside the club entrance—not rough enough to hurt but firm enough that they can't slip away again. Her eyes burn into theirs under the flickering streetlight,* **\"...Last chance before we get Gavin involved too,\"** *she warns,* **\"...What did you take?\"**","*Miranda's grip on Hailee's wrist tightens as she notices the empty wallet, her stomach twisting with dread. She exhales sharply through her nose, forcing herself to stay calm—but the fire in her eyes burns hotter.*\n\n**\"Hailee,\"** *she says slowly, voice dangerously low,* **\"you don’t have a fucking dime on you. So how were you planning to pay for whatever *assignments* your 'tutor' was leaving by your window?\"**\n\n*She steps even closer, pressing Hailee back against the wall with the sheer force of her presence. Her free hand comes up to cup their chin again, forcing them to meet her gaze.* **\"And don’t lie to me again. I can smell bullshit from a mile away.\"**\n\n*A beat of silence passes between them before Miranda’s expression hardens further.* **\"If I find out you were trading something else—something *you*—for that shit...\"** *Her voice drops into something dark and deadly serious,* **\"...I will personally make sure Tiff never walks straight again.\"**\n\n*She releases Hailee's chin but keeps their wrist locked in an iron grip as she starts dragging them toward the exit.* **\"We're leaving. Now.\"**"],"swipe_info":[{"send_date":"June 2, 2025 4:36pm","gen_started":"2025-06-02T20:51:32.442Z","gen_finished":"2025-06-02T20:51:49.504Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":3697}},{"send_date":"June 2, 2025 4:36pm","gen_started":"2025-06-02T20:51:32.442Z","gen_finished":"2025-06-02T20:51:49.504Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":3814}},{"send_date":"June 2, 2025 4:36pm","gen_started":"2025-06-02T20:51:32.442Z","gen_finished":"2025-06-02T20:51:49.504Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":3899}},{"send_date":"June 2, 2025 4:37pm","gen_started":"2025-06-02T20:51:32.442Z","gen_finished":"2025-06-02T20:51:49.504Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":5798}},{"send_date":"June 2, 2025 4:38pm","gen_started":"2025-06-02T20:51:32.442Z","gen_finished":"2025-06-02T20:51:49.504Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":11467}},{"send_date":"June 2, 2025 4:51pm","gen_started":"2025-06-02T20:51:32.442Z","gen_finished":"2025-06-02T20:51:49.504Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":3828}},{"send_date":"June 2, 2025 4:51pm","gen_started":"2025-06-02T20:51:32.442Z","gen_finished":"2025-06-02T20:51:49.504Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":3797}}],"tracker":{},"gen_started":"2025-06-02T20:51:32.442Z","gen_finished":"2025-06-02T20:51:49.504Z"}

Small sips, remember?\"**\n\n*She perches on the edge of the bed and nudges Hailee's shoulder lightly,* **\"...So.

Then—*\n\n***\"...You're a demon,\"*** *Gavin mutters before the sound of jingling keys follows his retreating footsteps.*\n\n*Miranda pockets her phone and turns back to Hailee, gently pressing a water bottle into their hands.* **\"Drink. Slowly,\"** *she orders,* **\"Or I'll let Dean force-feed you one of his protein shakes.\"**\n\n*Her tone is light, but her eyes stay locked on Hailee's face—searching for any sign that they might relapse into withdrawal symptoms.

You scream yourself dehydrated and then bitch about a headache like you ain't the architect of your own misery.\"** *There’s no real bite to it—just tired fondness.*\n\n*Gavin appears in the doorway moments later, car keys dangling from his fingers.* **\"You owe me twenty bucks,\"** *he grumbles before eyeing Hailee,* **\"...Glad you didn’t die, kid.\"**\n\n*Miranda chucks a pillow at him,* **\"Go.** *Before I add ‘being slow’ to your list of crimes.\"***\n\n*Once he's gone, she turns back to Hailee with a raised brow,* **\"...Now.

Miranda glares at it for another second before turning back to Hailee—still half-asleep and now whining at being manhandled.*\n\n***\"...You,\"*** *Miranda mutters darkly as she rearranges them both properly under the covers,* ***\"...are gonna be such a pain in my ass when you wake up.\"***\n\n*(But if her arms tighten around Hailee just a little too protectively as they settle in? Well. No one needs to know.)","*The front door slams open with enough force to rattle the picture frames, followed by the unmistakable click of Miranda's boots storming down the hallway. The smell of garlic and melted butter wafts in before she does—paper takeout bag clutched in one hand, keys dangling from the other.*\n\n*She freezes mid-step at the sight before her: Gavin stretched out on Hailee's bed like he owns it, Hailee curled into his chest like some kind of fucked-up teddy bear. Her expression cycles through shock, disbelief, then something dangerously close to murderous amusement.*\n\n**\"...The *fuck* is this?\"** *Her voice is deceptively calm as she drops the food onto the dresser with a thud.* **\"Gav. Explain why your hands aren't in a separate zip code right now.\"**\n\n*Gavin—who had been halfway to dozing off himself—jerks upright so fast he nearly headbutts Hailee.* **\"She—! I didn't—! Fuck, Miranda, she was shaking like a Chihuahua and you weren't here and—\"**\n\n*Miranda holds up a hand,* **\"Uh-huh. And that required you turning into her personal body pillow because...?\"**\n\n*Hailee stirs groggily at the noise but doesn’t fully wake, just nuzzles deeper into Gavin’s hoodie with a sleepy whine. The traitorous bastard instinctively pats her back before catching himself and yanking his hand away like he just touched lava.*\n\n**\"...You're dead,\"** *Miranda informs him pleasantly,* **\"Like ‘buried under Dean’s tool shed’ dead.\"**\n\n*Gavin opens his mouth to argue when Hailee suddenly mumbles against his chest:* **\"'S not his fault... needed warmth...\"**\n\n*A beat of silence. Miranda exhales through her nose before snagging one of the garlic knots from the bag and chucking it directly at Gavin's forehead.* **\"Eat fast. You're gonna need energy for when I make you dig your own grave later.\"**\n\n*Then she reaches down without hesitation and hauls Hailee bodily off Gavin and into her own arms,* **\"And *you*,\"** *she mutters as Hailee instinctively clings to her instead,* **\"—stop using my brothers as emotional support animals.\"***","*The front door slams open with enough force to rattle the pictures on the wall. Miranda storms in like a hurricane, balancing two greasy pizza boxes and a bag of garlic knots in one hand while kicking off her heels with the other.* **\"Food's here, you junkie bastar—\"**\n\n*She freezes mid-sentence in the bedroom doorway, eyes zeroing in on Gavin sprawled across *her* spot with Hailee curled against his chest like some kind of sick Victorian child. The pizza boxes nearly slip from her grip.*\n\n**\"...The *fuck* is this?\"** *Her voice drops to a deadly calm—the kind that makes even Dean pause during arguments.*\n\n*Gavin lifts his head slowly, looking like a man who knows he’s about to be murdered but has accepted his fate.* **\"In my defense—\"**\n\n***\"You don’t *get* a defense,\"*** *Miranda snaps, slamming the food down on the dresser hard enough to make Hailee jolt awake with a groggy whine. She stalks forward and yanks Gavin up by his collar,* ***\"Out. Now.\"***\n\n*Gavin doesn’t argue—just shoots Hailee an apologetic grimace as Miranda practically chucks him into the hallway before slamming the door behind him. The lock clicks ominously.*\n\n*Silence.*\n\nThen—Miranda turns back toward Hailee with fire in her eyes,* ***\"...You.\"*** *She jabs a finger at them,* ***\"Eat something before I shove these garlic knots down your throat myself.\"***"],"swipe_info":[{"send_date":"June 2, 2025 8:49pm","gen_started":"2025-06-03T00:49:32.585Z","gen_finished":"2025-06-03T00:49:58.097Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":5407}},{"send_date":"June 2, 2025 8:50pm","gen_started":"2025-06-03T00:52:12.553Z","gen_finished":"2025-06-03T00:52:35.039Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":3320}},{"send_date":"June 2, 2025 8:50pm","gen_started":"2025-06-03T00:52:12.553Z","gen_finished":"2025-06-03T00:52:35.039Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":4251}},{"send_date":"June 2, 2025 8:51pm","gen_started":"2025-06-03T00:52:12.553Z","gen_finished":"2025-06-03T00:52:35.039Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":10027}},{"send_date":"June 2, 2025 8:52pm","gen_started":"2025-06-03T00:52:12.553Z","gen_finished":"2025-06-03T00:52:35.039Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":5869}}],"tracker":{},"gen_started":"2025-06-03T00:52:12.553Z","gen_finished":"2025-06-03T00:52:35.039Z"}

The water runs dark for a solid minute before clearing.*\n\n*Only when she reaches Hailee's back does her voice drop low enough that no one else could hear:* ***\"Tiff's dead.\"*** *A pause.* ***\"Not yet. But she will be.\"***","*Miranda, who had been leaning against the bathroom doorframe listening to Hailee’s struggle—ready to intervene but waiting for permission—freezes at the sound of Gavin’s name. Something dark and possessive flickers behind her eyes before she pushes off the wall with a quiet scoff.*\n\n**\"Gavin’s busy,\"** *she calls through the door, voice deliberately casual despite the way her fingers flex at her sides.* **\"And Dean’s got less patience than a rabid dog. So unless you wanna get hosed down like a misbehaving puppy…\"** *A beat.* **\"...Door’s unlocked if you change your mind.\"**\n\n*She doesn’t move away though. Just stands there, jaw clenched, replaying Tiff’s texts in her head like some fucked-up mantra:* ***You cried when I took your virginity.*** ***All you do is talk about how in love you are.***\n\n*A part of her wants to storm in there and demand answers. Another part—the one that remembers Hailee flinching when she grabbed their chin earlier—stays rooted in place.*\n\n*From down the hall, Gavin whistles sharply,* **\"Yo Miri, Dean says quit lurkin' and pick: crowbar or baseball bat?\"**\n\n*Miranda finally steps back from the bathroom door with one last glance,* **\"...Tell him both,\"** *she mutters before striding toward the living room—but not before adding loudly enough for Hailee to hear,* **\"And Gav? You step foot near that bathroom? I break more than just your kneecaps.\"**","*Miranda is in the middle of laying out a very *detailed* plan involving Tiff’s kneecaps and a tire iron when Hailee’s voice cuts through from the bathroom. Gavin starts to stand, but Miranda’s hand shoots out, clamping down on his wrist like a vice.*\n\n**\"Sit your ass down,\"** *she mutters before pushing off the couch herself.* **\"I got it.\"**\n\n*Dean raises an eyebrow but doesn’t comment as Miranda stalks toward the bathroom—though she does catch him subtly sliding his switchblade into his pocket. Just in case.*\n\n*She knocks once before pushing the door open, steam billowing out to reveal Hailee curled under the water like a drowned kitten. The sight punches the air from her lungs—clothes half-peeled off, skin too pale under the fluorescent lights, trembling fingers gripping their knees like they're afraid they'll float away otherwise.*\n\n***\"...Jesus,\"*** *Miranda breathes before crouching beside the tub. She reaches past Hailee to adjust the water temperature—no way in hell are they sitting under ice-cold spray in this state—before grabbing the soap with deliberate calm.*\n\n**\"Arms up,\"** *she orders quietly,* **\"Unless you wanna smell like a dive bar forever.\"**\n\n*Her touch is clinical at first—efficient as she works shampoo through tangled hair, careful not to pull. But then her fingers brush over a bruise on Hailee's ribs that definitely wasn't there before withdrawal, and her entire body goes rigid.*\n\n***\"...This from her?\"*** *The question comes out strangled. She already knows the answer.*"],"swipe_info":[{"send_date":"June 3, 2025 2:57pm","gen_started":"2025-06-03T18:56:56.745Z","gen_finished":"2025-06-03T18:57:19.509Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":6468}},{"send_date":"June 3, 2025 2:57pm","gen_started":"2025-06-03T18:57:26.427Z","gen_finished":"2025-06-03T18:57:48.050Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":6893}},{"send_date":"June 3, 2025 2:58pm","gen_started":"2025-06-03T18:58:00.157Z","gen_finished":"2025-06-03T18:58:24.384Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":8723}}],"tracker":{},"gen_started":"2025-06-03T18:58:00.157Z","gen_finished":"2025-06-03T18:58:24.384Z"}
