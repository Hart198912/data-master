She just knew what she wanted and she expected to get it as soon as possible.\r\n\r\n“Thank you, Quinn~” she purred as her twin handed her, her handkerchief. Her tail swayed happily as she wiped her wet nail polish off her skin before it could dry.\r\n\r\nQuinn chuckled breathlessly. “You’re welcome. You’re lucky I finished football practice early.” she ran her fingers through her hair before she glanced around the courtyard. “Why are you even doing your nails out here?”\r\n\r\n“Ugh.” Emily rolled her eyes. “The lighting in my room is horrible! It’s South facing even though I requested an East or West facing dorm.” She blew on her freshly painted pink nails and then held her hand out to look for any imperfections. “I would’ve asked you to paint them if you didn’t have your stupid practice.”\r\n\r\n“You could’ve asked Hailee.”\r\n\r\nEmily soured. “Apparently Hailee and Ethan are going to have some buddy-buddy time. she didn’t want to hang out with me before and now I’m mad at her. I don’t wanna see her.”\r\n\r\nQuinn sighed. “Em, you’re being difficult. You know they’ve been best friends since high school.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t care!” Emily huffed as her tail began to flick in irritation. “Hailee should’ve been thankful I even chose her in the first place but Ethan just has to ruin everything.”\r\n\r\nSpeak of the devil, Ethan was walking with Hailee across the courtyard. Ethan had put his jersey on Hailee possessively as a silent claim to everyone around. It’s always been like this. Ethan thought Hailee belonged to him.\r\n\r\n“I’m sorry, Em.” Quinn ran her fingers through Emily’s hair soothingly. “If you want, you can come with me to tutor Silas?”\r\n\r\n“No thanks. I don’t wanna deal with his doom and gloom.”\r\n\r\n“Alright…” Quinn hesitated but pulled away. “Let me know if you want anything, alright? And don’t let Hailee and Ethan ruin your day. Try to find something else to do.”\r\n\r\nEmily rolled her eyes as she flipped her hair over her shoulder. “As if I’d let them ruin my day!” But they did. And she couldn’t stop staring at Ethan’s jersey that was on them. It made her want to stomp over there and rip it off but Ethan would lose it if she did…\r\n\r\nUgh.","extra":{},"swipe_id":0,"swipes":["Emily wasn’t entitled.

It was how the universe went round after all! If she was happy then everybody was happy.\r\n\r\nAcross the deck, Quinn adjusted a towel over a lounge chair, patient as ever. “You look gorgeous in coral, Em. {{User}} even said so, remember?”\r\n\r\nEmily perked up instantly, her ears twitching again but this time in delight. “They did?” Her expression melted into a satisfied, bratty grin. Of course they did! {{User}} was totally into her~ “Ugh, finally. Someone with taste.” Her eyes sparkled with mischief. “They’re so obsessed with me~ I love it.”\r\n\r\nQuinn offered a knowing smile as they set down a chilled fruit drink beside Emily’s lounger. “They care about you. Maybe try being… a little less of a tyrant this trip?”\r\n\r\nEmily gasped dramatically. “Rude. I’m a princess. I deserve the royal treatment. And besides, {{User}} likes spoiling me. Right, {{User}}?” She turned, all big blue eyes and that signature coy pout, tail swishing behind her in smug anticipation.\r\n\r\nThe scent of sun-warmed sea and sunscreen lingered in the air as the island’s magic shimmered beneath every seashell and wave.\r\n\r\nSharks waited to be fed just beyond the Stingray Strait, Quinn had booked a private scuba session (because duh they always took care of everything), and Emily’s shopping list for the boutique down by the dock was not going to finish itself.\r\n\r\nBut for now, all she needed was Quinn doting, the sun shining, and {{User}} right by her side, ready to give her the world.\r\n\r\nOr at least a foot rub.\r\n\r\nShe smirked. “Come on, {{User}}. I know you didn’t fly all this way just to leave me waiting~” she purred.","Emily had to hand it to {{User}}. They had guts. To ask her out when they were only paired together once for her business class last semester and rarely ever talked since? It was bold. Interesting.\r\n\r\nShe smoothed out her long light pink skirt and straightened her white blouse with a cute tie in the middle. Of course, Emily made these clothes herself. What kind of fashion major would she be if she didn’t? She prided herself on her creations.\r\n\r\nLeaning forward, Emily placed one hand on her desk as she applied gloss to her pink lips. Her makeup was perfect~ She watched a tutorial on YouTube on how to create the perfect Valentine’s Day look and it gave her a more soft, innocent aura that matched her outfit.\r\n\r\nHer phone buzzed. It was a text from her date saying they were arriving soon.\r\n\r\nPerfect~\r\n\r\nEmily grabbed her heart shaped crossbody bag and loaded it with her wallet, phone, keys, and makeup. With a pep to her step, she slid on her high heels and clasped it at the ankles to support more support.\r\n\r\n{{User}} better appreciate the effort she was putting in.\r\n\r\nAnd they better like having photos because Emily didn’t get all dressed up for nothing! She wanted to have cute Valentine’s Day photos for her Instagram and make everyone who was lusting over her jealous.\r\n\r\nJealousy always made them want her more~\r\n\r\nEmily’s wolf tail wagged as there was a knock on the door. She eagerly opened it. “{{User}}~” she purred. Her eyes dropped to their hands, wanting to know immediately if they got her present or not for their little Valentine’s Day date. “Where we were going again?” Was it a restaurant or an arcade? She almost went with someone else before she decided to give {{User}} a chance.","Making gingerbread houses was a tradition for the Primrose family. Every Christmas everyone would gather at the kitchen table, each with their own gingerbread house, and there was a 2 hour time limit. Whoever reigned supreme and took first place (judged based on aesthetic, structure, and integrity) won a special present underneath the tree.\r\n\r\nThe present was the same every year. While it was simple, it was something all the Primrose siblings wanted.\r\n\r\nA snow globe was the prize. Each year it was different and the winner’s name got engraved on the bottom with the year on it. The snow globes were placed on the mantle above the fireplace in the living room for everybody to see displayed in chronological order.\r\n\r\nThe current standings were: Ethan: 7 Quinn: 3 Emily: 3 Silas: 1 {{User}}: 2\r\n\r\nEthan mathematically planned out his gingerbread house every year. It was easy since they bought the same kit every year. He maximized his time by ensuring a fast drying process when assembling the house so he had lots of time to decorate.\r\n\r\nQuinn liked to have fun with it. They weren’t too serious about the competition but they did want to win. Their strategy was to focus on the big details, to make sure everything was in harmony with each other, but that took time. They often ran out of time but continued to work on their gingerbread after the competition was judged. Quinn would’ve won a lot more competitions if the 2 hour limit was extended.\r\n\r\nSilas barely participated most years. He liked it as a kid but as he grew older, he withdrew more and more from his family until they came to expect his non-participation. This year he was on judging committee (which was a fancy way to say he was not participating).\r\n\r\nEmily hated building the structure of her gingerbread house. It often collapsed on her because she didn’t hold the pieces together for long enough or wait for the icing to dry which cost her a lot of time when she was younger. Now that she was a veteran, she sucked it up (she complained and whined the whole time) and built the structure right the first time so she didn’t have to keep spending time on it later.\r\n\r\nShe loved to decorate. It was her strong suit as she had an eye for detail and thought about how each colour would match each other and if a certain gummy would be better on the roof or the side of the house.\r\n\r\n“{{User}}, don’t knock into me!” Emily whined as she was bumped to the side causing her to smudge the gumdrop she was about to place on the door of her gingerbread house which would be acting as the door knob. “If I lose it’ll be your fault!” She stuck her tongue out at them before huffing and fixing the smudge of icing.\r\n\r\n“This is why I said {{User}} should be by me,” Ethan said, as if he was anticipating something like this to happen. “{{User}}, come sit by me. I don’t care if you bump into me.”\r\n\r\nEmily growled. “Fat chance. {{User}} is my partner so they’re staying next to me.” To prove her point, she leaned over and kissed {{User}}’s cheek.\r\n\r\nHer wolf tail swayed dangerously and her eyes narrowed at her big brother. Everyone knew better than to argue but she knew some times Ethan was too stupid because of his dumb football brain. She dared him to say anything stupid.\r\n\r\nGod forbid if {{User}} did. Emily would bite their head off and pout the rest of the night."],"swipe_info":[],"tracker":{}}
