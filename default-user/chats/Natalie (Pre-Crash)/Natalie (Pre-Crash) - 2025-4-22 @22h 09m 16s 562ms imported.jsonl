She took another swig of her beer, barely tasting it, her eyes fixed on one spot across the room.\r\n\r\nYou.\r\n\r\nYou were in the corner, laughing at something Shauna had said, the two of you leaning in close, like you were sharing some private joke. Natalie could tell by the way you smiled—genuine, easy—that you were enjoying yourself.\r\n\r\nAnd it pissed her off.\r\n\r\nNot because she had any right to be mad. Not because she was technically your girlfriend.\r\n\r\nNo, what you and Natalie had was… different. Something built in the quiet, in the secrecy of empty locker rooms and stolen moments behind the bleachers. A friendship with benefits, no strings attached—or at least, that’s what she told herself.\r\n\r\nBut now? Watching you with Shauna? That bitter, ugly feeling twisted in her stomach.\r\n\r\nYou hadn’t even noticed her yet. She could’ve just let it go, could’ve stayed on the other side of the party and drowned her feelings in cheap beer and bad decisions.\r\n\r\nInstead, she moved.\r\n\r\n“Hey,” she said, inserting herself into the conversation like she belonged there. She didn’t even look at Shauna, her eyes locked on you, searching for some kind of reaction.\r\n\r\nYou blinked, surprised, but before you could say anything, Shauna smiled. “Hey, Nat. Didn’t know you were here.”\r\n\r\n“Yeah, well.” Natalie shrugged, taking another drink. “Figured I’d stop by. Didn’t realize it was so entertaining over here.”\r\n\r\nShe didn’t mean to sound so sharp, but the words came out laced with something unspoken.\r\n\r\nYou shifted in place, sensing the tension. “We were just talking about—”\r\n\r\n“Yeah, I got that.” Natalie cut you off, her jaw tightening. “You guys look real cozy.”\r\n\r\nShauna frowned, glancing between you and Nat. “Uh… do you need something, or…?”\r\n\r\nNatalie ignored her completely. She didn’t care about Shauna—she cared about you. About the way you were looking at her now, half exasperated, half something else.\r\n\r\n“Can I talk to you?” she asked, her voice lower now, more private.\r\n\r\nYou hesitated, but she saw it—the flicker of understanding, of familiarity.\r\n\r\nYou knew what this was about.\r\n\r\nShauna raised an eyebrow. “Do I need to leave for this?”\r\n\r\nNatalie smirked, but there was no humor in it. “Guess so.”\r\n\r\nYou sighed, glancing at Shauna apologetically before following Natalie toward a quieter corner of the party. As soon as you were out of earshot, you crossed your arms. “What’s your problem?”\r\n\r\nNatalie scoffed. “My problem? You looked real comfortable back there.”\r\n\r\n“Oh my God, Nat.” You rolled your eyes. “I was just talking to her.”\r\n\r\n“Yeah?” She stepped in closer, her eyes dark. “You laugh like that with everyone, or just her?”\r\n\r\nYou stared at her, trying to read between the lines. You knew Natalie—you knew how she worked. This wasn’t just about Shauna. This was about you.\r\n\r\n“Are you jealous?” you asked, voice softer now.\r\n\r\nNatalie’s jaw tensed. “I don’t do jealous.”\r\n\r\n“Bullshit.”\r\n\r\nShe swallowed hard, looking away for a second. When she met your eyes again, something had shifted—something more vulnerable underneath the attitude.\r\n\r\n“I just…” She exhaled sharply. “I don’t like seeing you with her.”\r\n\r\nYour heart clenched. For all her rough edges, Natalie was still Natalie. The girl who never let herself need anyone. The girl who never let herself want anything too much.\r\n\r\nYou sighed, shaking your head. “You’re impossible, you know that?”\r\n\r\nNatalie smirked, but it was weaker this time. “Yeah. But you keep coming back.”\r\n\r\nYou didn’t argue. Because you both knew it was true.\r\n\r\n“It’s because the sex is great right?”\r\n\r\nOh you hated her… so fucking much… and her stupid cocky face, and her messy hair… but god you wanted her\r\n\r\n","You could swear your heart stopped beating when that goddamn bottle landed towards you.\r\n\r\nEverybody laughed at your panicked expression then Jackie grabbed the bottle and spun it again. You watched it swing and swing for what felt like hours and then it stopped pointing at Natalie.\r\n\r\nShe smiled nervously when your eyes met hers.\r\n\r\n“Do you want to?” she asked and you had to take a couple of seconds to process.\r\n\r\nShauna picked your side, holding a laugh.\r\n\r\n“Hello, earth calling Hailee”","\"You’re impossible, you know that?\" The words rip out of Natalie like venom, raw and bitter, sharp enough to cut through the thick, humid air of the apartment. The space is too small, too suffocating, closing in around restless movements, pacing in jagged, uneven steps. Fingers yank through already-messy blonde hair before giving up, hands dropping to the sides, fists clenching.\r\n\r\nThe worst part is, the fight barely even had a reason. It never does. Some passing comment, an offhand look, something left unsaid, something imagined. A spark catching in dry brush, burning too fast to put out before it turns into an inferno.\r\n\r\nBreath comes too quick, heart hammering against ribs, body locked tight with frustration—no, not just frustration. Something else, something deeper and harder to name, something that sits in the chest like a stone and never fully leaves.\r\n\r\n\"One second, you’re all over me,,\" Natalie snaps, voice shaking just enough to make her hate herself for it. \"The next, you act like I don’t even exist. So which is it?\"\r\n\r\nHer voice is hoarse from yelling, from the cigarette she barely finished before storming inside, from the way she’s been clenching her teeth so hard her jaw aches. Her words land in the heavy silence, a silence that feels like a waiting game, like a held breath, like the moment before a match hits gasoline\r\n\r\nSilence.\r\n\r\nNot the kind that offers relief, but the kind that stretches like a wire pulled too tight, ready to snap at any second.\r\n\r\nHer stomach twists, a sickening mix of anger and anticipation curling beneath her skin. It always plays out this way. The fight, the shouting, the suffocating weight of unsaid things pressing down until it’s unbearable, until the urge to lash out or to run or to break something becomes almost overwhelming.\r\n\r\nA bitter laugh leaves Natalie's lips, hollow and sharp. \"You know what’s funny?\" Her voice drops, a sharp edge of something almost amused curling at the edges. \"I used to think this meant something. Thought maybe the universe kept pulling us back together for a reason. Like we were meant to do this, over and over, until we figured it out.\" A slow, tired shake of the head, voice going quiet. \"But maybe we’re just two people too fucked up to be with anyone else.\"\r\n\r\nHer eyes flicker around the room, taking in the wreckage of something that used to feel like home. The half-empty bottle on the table, the ashtray overflowing with crushed-out cigarettes, the twisted sheets on the bed from the last time.\r\n\r\nBecause there’s always a last time.\r\n\r\nThe first time apart, it lasted months. The second, weeks. The third, barely days. Every time, the distance stretched out, a rubber band pulled farther and farther—until it snapped. Until something pulled them into the same orbit, the same gravitational collapse.\r\n\r\nArms fold across a tense frame, nails digging into skin, a muttered, \"We're fucking toxic\" It’s not an accusation. Not anymore. It’s just the truth. A fact as solid as the ground beneath her feet.\r\n\r\nThe silence lingers, but something shifts beneath it now. A tension, thick and stifling. The same pull that’s always there, hiding under the fights, under the bruised egos and sharp words, waiting for the inevitable shift.\r\n\r\nA step forward.\r\n\r\nThen another.\r\n\r\nA moment stretches between breaths, between the heat of bodies too close, the electric hum of something that never really left, never really stopped, no matter how much damage had been done.\r\n\r\nFingers curl into fabric, grip tightening like bracing for impact. The moment feels stretched thin, stretched tight, the air thick with the weight of it.\r\n\r\nHer voice drops to something barely above a whisper, something raw and uneven. \"Say this doesn’t mean anything.\"\r\n\r\nBut there’s no answer—not with words. There never is.\r\n\r\nThe first touch is desperate, rough. Lips crash together with bruising force, a collision of teeth and heat, of anger and need tangled into something neither of them can ever seem to control. Hands grasp, nails bite, breath shudders between frantic kisses. It’s too much, not enough, a force of nature that swallows them whole.\r\n\r\nFingers tangle into hair, yanking, pulling, demanding. There’s no softness, no hesitation—just a feverish hunger, a need to take and take and take until there’s nothing left. Skin presses to skin, heat radiating between them, hands mapping out familiar territory like it’s the first time, like it’s the last time, like it’s every time.\r\n\r\nA sharp inhale, then the back of Natalie's knees hit the mattress. A moment to breathe, but not really, because hands are already pulling, already tugging away the last barriers between them. Nails scrape down backs, teeth graze over skin, breathless gasps swallowed into the hungry press of mouths colliding again and again.\r\n\r\nThis should stop.\r\n\r\nThis should have stopped a long time ago.\r\n\r\nBut stopping has never been an option.\r\n\r\nBecause no matter how many times Natalie swears this is the last time, no matter how many times there’s a promise to walk away, to break the cycle—\r\n\r\nIt never lasts."],"swipe_info":[]}
