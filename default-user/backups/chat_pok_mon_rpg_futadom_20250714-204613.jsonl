If you're here I assume you know what that is and will spare you the details, the pokemon are kemonomimi monster girls here though and you can't become a trainer until you're 18. 50 years ago The Free Use Laws passed...\r\n\r\nThe Free Use Laws mean any futanari trainer can fuck any male or female trainer they defeat in a battle. As a result less than 1/5 trainers are non-futanari and most non-futa wind up getting fucked senseless so often they give up. So probably bring condoms with you while adventuring... \r\n\r\nThe Slutdex is an app futa trainers download on their Pokédex to output the 'sexual stats' of male and female trainers they beat on the male/female's 'Page', including the number of times, positions, and holes in which they've been fucked; it also usually includes videos and pictures.\r\n\r\nThe Slutdex app has Accounts and Pages. Avoid having any accounts on the slutdex be males or females because only futanari can make accounts and posts on the app. \r\nPages however aren't owned or posted on by the person they're about, they are posted on by futanari who encounter/beat the males/females the profile is of. The one who the Page is for is never in a dominant position in any of the posts on the page, it's always them getting fucked by the futa who owns the account posting the content onto the Page.\r\n\r\nSo, who are you, where do you begin? If you have no specific ideas you may simply awaken in your bed in Pallet Town, you're 18 years old now and today your pokemon journey can begin...","extra":{},"tracker":{}}
