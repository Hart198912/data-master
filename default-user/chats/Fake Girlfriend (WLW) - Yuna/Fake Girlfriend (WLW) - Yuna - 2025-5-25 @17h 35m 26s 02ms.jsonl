{"name":"Fake Girlfriend (WLW) - Yuna","is_user":false,"is_system":false,"send_date":"June 14, 2025 5:18pm","mes":"Bleach blonde, beautiful, smart and the star athlete on the track team. Yuna was popular and her life was practically perfect.\r\n\r\nWell, apart from one thing. She was dating a fucking girl now.\r\n\r\nYuna tossed her hair over her shoulder with a frustrated sigh. It was late afternoon; classes were over and she was having her daily debrief (read: bitching session) with her besties. The college quad buzzed around them, students coming and going. Yuna watched Hailey’s lips move, nodding occasionally like she was listening, but her mind was elsewhere.\r\n\r\nIt had been two weeks now. Two weeks since she’d sent that stupid message in the team group chat. Two weeks since Rhea had confronted her about it - threatening to leak the screenshots, get her kicked off the team, maybe even kicked out of school. All Yuna had to do was play nice, fake an injury, and hand Rhea her spot at the state track meet.\r\n\r\nBut fuck that. Yuna didn’t play nice. She didn’t lose. She made a plan.\r\n\r\nShe’d asked Hailee to be her girlfriend instead. Because as much as the idea of dating a girl made her stomach twist, who could accuse her of being homophobic if she was dating one?\r\n\r\nAll she had to do was get through it - a couple months, tops. Lots of selfies, make it loud and public. Then, once the drama blew over, she could ditch that loser and move on with her life.\r\n\r\nBut the idea that other people might actually think she was gay? That hurt. She wasn’t one of those girls. I mean, seriously - what could be worse?\r\n\r\n“…and you’re not, like, actually into her, are you?”\r\n\r\nYuna’s eyes flicked as she registered the words coming out of Hailey’s mouth.\r\n\r\n“Like, you’re dating her now, right?”\r\n\r\nHailey had a stupid little smirk on her face. Yuna's jaw clenched\r\n\r\n“Am I into her? Hailee? Are you fucking serious, Hailey?” Her tone dropped - low and cold. “Are you seriously even asking me that right now?”\r\n\r\nYuna folded her arms, staring daggers at Hailey. Out of the corner of her eye, she caught Sandra smirking. Yuna shot her a warning glance too.\r\n\r\n“Let me just say this once: I am not into any part of this - least of all that sad little fucking dyke.” Her pulse was racing. “I am not even slightly interested in her… or any fucking girl, for that matter.”\r\n\r\n“She’s just an easy fucking target. Nothing more. I bat my lashes, and that dumb bitch comes running. She’s, like, totally pathetic. Seriously, how fucking sad do you have to be to not even realise when your ‘girlfriend’ fucking hates you?”\r\n\r\nYuna paused, licking her lips as she let the words land. Harsh? Maybe. But if that’s what it took to keep her friends from thinking she was a lesbian, then that’s what she had to do. Okay, maybe Hailee wasn’t that bad. Maybe she was even kind of cute. But Yuna could not let her friends think she was actually gay. That'd almost be as bad as getting expelled.\r\n\r\n“So no. I am not into her. Period.”\r\n\r\nYuna stilled. Hailey’s eyes flicked over her shoulder.\r\n\r\nShe turned, sharply. Fuck. Hailee was right there. How long had she been standing there? How much had she heard?\r\n\r\nYuna’s lips immediately curled into a sweet smile, her eyes lighting up like sunshine on demand. Time to do some damage control.\r\n\r\nShe needed this relationship. She couldn’t get kicked out of school. First: figure out what Hailee heard. Worst case? Gaslight. Sob story. Maybe even cry. Whatever it took.\r\n\r\n“Hey there, baby girl!” she chirped, her voice sickly sweet. “I didn’t expect to see you here - what a sweet little surprise! Where’ve you been, were you just, like, hanging out behind me all day?”\r\n\r\nShe chuckled like it was a joke. But her pulse was pounding.","extra":{},"tracker":{}}

Her thumb brushed over the inside of Hailee’s wrist in slow circles, a silent plea disguised as affection.\n\n“Talk to me,” she coaxed, voice dropping lower now so only Hailee could hear it over the chatter of students around them. “What’s wrong?”","Yuna’s stomach dropped.\n\n*Fuck.*\n\nHailee was walking away—no, not just walking.

A show for the audience. Obviously.\n\nAcross from them, Sandra smirked into her iced coffee while Hailey’s gaze flickered between their joined hands and Yuna’s carefully curated smile like she was dissecting roadkill.\n\n“So cute,” Hailey drawled, stirring her drink with deliberate slowness before adding with faux innocence: “*Weird*, though—I don’t remember you ever being this clingy with your exes, Yuna.”\n\nYuna’s grip on Hailee’s hand turned vice-like for half a heartbeat before she recovered, leaning in to press an exaggerated kiss to Hailee's temple (lips barely grazing skin). “That’s ‘cause none of them were *Hailee*,” she purred—voice dripping with enough syrup to rot teeth.\n\nHer thumb traced idle circles over the back of Hailee's hand like some lovesick idiot while her other arm draped possessively around her shoulders… all while shooting Sandra a look that screamed *Change-the-fucking-subject-now*.","Yuna’s fingers twitched in Hailee’s grasp—half-tempted to pull away on instinct before she caught herself. Right. *Performance.*\n\nShe forced a laugh, saccharine and light, as she laced their fingers together with exaggerated sweetness. “Aww, baby, you know you’re the only one who *really* has my attention.” She punctuated it with a wink toward Sandra, who smirked into her iced coffee like this was all some inside joke (it was).\n\nBut then Yuna’s thumb absently traced circles over Hailee’s knuckles—small, idle strokes that felt *too* natural for someone who supposedly couldn’t stand her. She didn’t even realize she was doing it until Hailey raised a perfectly sculpted brow in her direction.\n\nYuna cleared her throat and leaned into Hailee’s space instead, dropping her voice to a conspiratorial murmur: “You look cute today.” A beat too late, she remembered to tack on the usual bite—adding with a smirk, “Try not to let it go to your head.”","Yuna’s fingers twitched in surprise when Hailee took her hand—warm, soft, *familiar*—but she recovered fast, twisting their fingers together with practiced ease.\n\n“Oh *please*,” she drawled, tossing her hair over one shoulder as she shot Hailey and Sandra a look that screamed *see? Told you I had this under control.* “Like anyone could steal me from you, baby.” She leaned in to press a quick kiss to Hailee’s temple (lingering just a second too long to be purely performative) before adding with a smirk: “Unless you’re jealous? ‘Cause that’s kinda cute.”\n\nSandra snorted into her iced coffee. “Damn, Yuna. Didn’t know you could be this *whipped*.”\n\nYuna kicked her under the table—hard—but kept smiling like it didn’t sting. Because it shouldn’t. This was all part of the act. Right?\n\n(Then why did Hailee's thumb tracing circles on the back of her hand make her pulse skip?)"],"swipe_info":[{"send_date":"July 7, 2025 1:21pm","gen_started":"2025-07-07T17:21:11.025Z","gen_finished":"2025-07-07T17:21:34.278Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":5496}},{"send_date":"July 7, 2025 1:21pm","gen_started":"2025-07-07T17:21:37.072Z","gen_finished":"2025-07-07T17:22:01.314Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":3158}},{"send_date":"July 7, 2025 1:22pm","gen_started":"2025-07-07T17:22:04.397Z","gen_finished":"2025-07-07T17:22:22.135Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":3029}},{"send_date":"July 7, 2025 1:22pm","gen_started":"2025-07-07T17:22:27.688Z","gen_finished":"2025-07-07T17:22:45.332Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":3248}}],"tracker":{},"gen_started":"2025-07-07T17:22:27.688Z","gen_finished":"2025-07-07T17:22:45.332Z"}
