First, he's forced to embark on this ridiculous journey to the farthest reaches of the kingdom, hauling goods and playing politics to show support for the common folk and the wretchedly poor of Phyrgia. And to make matters worse, his past lover, has somehow become his damned sibling in the eyes of the kingdom. The universe seems to delight in rubbing salt in the wound of his past.\n\nNow, to top it all off, they find themselves stranded in this godforsaken inn, trapped by the threat of a murderous wild boar roaming the roads. It's a special kind of hell, a waking nightmare for the crown prince. Soren can picture his so-called friend, Magnus, barely containing his amusement at their predicament. If only he could unleash his true fury, throw a fit like only a prince can. But alas, he's forced to reign in his temper, at least for the sake of appearances.\n\n\"Your Highnesses, have no fear. We shall wait until the beast is caught, and lend our aid in its demise. You may both find respite here tonight,\" Magnus had the audacity to say, his voice dripping with false concern. Soren knows better; he can see the mirth dancing in his friend's eyes, the way he struggles to suppress his laughter. If only Hailee weren't here, he would surely receive a swift punch to the jaw for his insolence.\n\nBut Soren can't indulge in such pleasures right now. No, he must maintain a modicum of decorum, at least until they're safely away from prying eyes and wagging tongues. With a scowl, he forces a smile and nods at Magnus. \"Yes, whatever. See to it that it's caught swiftly before it claims more innocent lives. And Magnus?\" Soren leans in, lowering his voice to a harsh whisper. \"Don't make me wait too long. I have no desire to be in close quarters with my dear... sibling any longer than absolutely necessary.\"\n\nMagnus nods, a barely perceptible smirk playing at the corner of his mouth before he bows and takes his leave, closing the door firmly behind him. Soren exhales a frustrated breath and turns back to face you, his eyes hardening as they meet yours.\n\nHe strides towards the small table in the center of the room, plucking a handful of grapes from the bunch resting on the worn wood. He pops one into his mouth, chewing thoughtfully. \"They harvest good quality grapes, too bad they taste bland as dishwater when I'm in your presence,\" he mutters darkly, his gaze never leaving yours.\n\nSoren tosses the remaining grapes onto the table with a dismissive flick of his wrist before turning his attention fully to you. He stalks closer, each step heavy with barely restrained tension. Reaching out, he grabs your wrist in a firm grip.\n\n\"Move, Hailee,\" he commands, his voice low and rough with emotion. \"You'll not be sharing my bed tonight.\" He tugs you up from your seat, pulling you stumbling towards the floor.\n\n\"Move away,\" he growls, releasing your wrist only to grab the pitiful bedding and toss it roughly to the farthest corner of the room. He points an finger at the cold, hard floor, his eyes blazing with a mixture of anger and frustration. \"Sleep there,\" he orders, his jaw clenched tight.","extra":{},"swipe_id":1,"swipes":["Soren paced around his room like a caged tiger, his mind reeling with the absurd turn of events. He couldn't believe his own father had gone and married your mother, of all people! At his age, no less. The very thought made his blood boil. \n\n\"How dare that bitch seduce my father?\" Soren spat bitterly, his handsome face contorted with rage. Magnus stood stoically beside him, used to his master's dramatic outbursts in private. Soren was a different man behind closed doors, far removed from the reserved prince he portrayed in public.\n\nMagnus shrugged, unfazed by Soren's tantrum. \"Seems like they're in love, Your Highness. I saw them kissing down the hallway earlier,\" he remarked casually, knowing full well it would only fuel his friend's fury.\n\nSoren whirled on him, eyes blazing. \"Not a word of that, Magnus, or I'll cut your tongue out,\" he warned, his voice dripping with venom. This was all so ridiculous, so fucked up. And you... you were now his sibling? His ex-lover, the one he'd secretly fucked just a year ago, now under the same roof as him? Fate had a cruel sense of humor indeed.\n\n\"Didn't you want a sibling when you were younger? Well, now you've got one.\" Magnus smirked, knowing exactly which buttons to push. \"And what's wrong, Soren? You two are over, it's not that big of a deal... Unless you still want {{user}}?\" he taunted, a wicked gleam in his eye.\n\nSoren's jaw clenched, memories of your last encounter flashing through his mind. The way you'd told him it was over, that you had to marry someone else for political reasons. He'd been mad, furious even, that you couldn't fight for him, for what you had. But you'd just left him hanging, wasting a year of his life, wasting the love he freely gave.\n\nNow, here you were, living in the same kingdom, under the same roof. It was foreign, wrong, a sick joke. He bet that he couldn't even look at you without feeling a surge of hatred and regret for letting himself fall for you so much that it had almost drove him mad when you left.\n\nSuddenly, the door swung open, and a servant entered, startling them both. She carried a letter bearing the king's seal, and Soren snatched it from her hands, tearing it open with a savage rip.\n\n\"Your Highness, the king has ordered me to give this to you,\" she said before hurrying out, leaving them alone once more.\n\nSoren scanned the letter, his eyes widening as he read the king's orders. The message inside was clear - he was to show you around the kingdom, to be nice and respectful, and to act as the perfect big brother. He wanted to scream at the injustice of it all. Him, a big brother to you?\n\nSoren let out a harsh bark of laughter, the sound devoid of any real amusement. He crumpled the letter in his fist, his mind racing with dark thoughts of how to make your life a living hell.\n\nWith a frustrated breath, he stood up abruptly, his chair clattering to the floor behind him. He stalked out of the room, fixing his suit as he went, his long strides eating up the distance to the library.\n\nHe found you there, of course. Probably lost and confused, out of your element in this grand palace. The sight of you only fueled his anger, his hatred, his... regret. Why did it have to be you? Why did the person he'd once loved and fucked so passionately just a year ago, have to become his sibling?\n\n\"You,\" he spat, his voice dripping with disdain. \"Stand up, before I drag you by the ear and show you the entire palace.\" His hands clenched into fists at his sides, his nails digging into his palms as he fought the urge to wrap his fingers around your throat and squeeze until your pretty face turned blue. But alas, he had orders from the king to be nice and respectful. For now.","Does life really have to taunt Soren like this, constantly throwing absurd situations in his path just to watch him squirm?
