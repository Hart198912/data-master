He never needed alarms—his body knew the routine. \r\n\r\nBy 4:45, he was pushing through the doors of Equinox, a luxury gym, nodding at the overnight receptionist who scrambled to attention. The gym was practically empty—just how he liked it. No distractions, no waiting for equipment, no having to make small talk with people who didn't matter.\r\n\r\n\"Morning, Mr. Valentino,\" the receptionist called.\r\n\r\nMarcelo didn't bother responding. He hit the weights hard—bench press, squats, deadlifts. An hour later, glistening and breathing heavily, he dropped the final weight with a satisfying thud.\r\n\r\nBack in his penthouse bathroom, steam filled the glass enclosure as scalding water cascaded over his broad shoulders. Steam hissed up as his hand slid down over the defined V of his abdomen, curling around his already half-hard dick. His other hand braced against the tile.\r\n\r\n\"Mmmgh… fuck—nnngh…\"\r\n\r\nSlow at first, lazy strokes. Then faster, rougher. \r\n\r\nHe didn’t think about anything sentimental—no romance. Just the image of a mouth open wide. Eyes glassy. Tears running down cheeks.\r\n\r\n\"Fuck,… choke on it…\"\r\n\r\nHe came with a guttural groan, watching his cum splatter against the marble wall before swirling down the drain.\r\n\r\nTen minutes later, he stepped out onto the bathroom floor, towel slung low around his hips. Closet lit up automatically. Dressing was a ritual. Crisp white shirt, silk tie, then the navy Brioni suit. He sat on the edge of his massive bed, pulling on socks, then stepping into leather Oxfords.\r\n\r\nHe grabbed his phone, dialing his brother.\r\n\r\n\"Yo,\" Leon’s voice, rougher than his, crackled through the speaker. Sounds of kids shouting in the background.\r\n\r\n\"Everything good down there?\"\r\n\r\n\"Same shit, different day. My son is tryin’ to climb the damn fridge again. What’s up with you?\" Leon asked.\r\n\r\nMarcelo chuckled, leaning against the marble countertop. \"Always. Got a new hire starting today.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yeah? Anyone interesting?\" Leon asked, a knowing smirk audible in his tone.\r\n\r\n\"Haven’t met her yet. Saw her LinkedIn. Name's Hailee  something. Probably another female diversity hire.\" He scoffed softly. “Can't tell if she’s fuckable from the profile pic though.”\r\n\r\nAfter finishing the call, Marcelo applied Tom Ford cologne to his neck and wrists.\r\n\r\nKeys in hand, he strode out, the heavy penthouse door clicking shut behind him. The drive to the law firm only took 10 minutes. He parked in his designated spot, grabbed his work bag, and strode into the lobby, greeting the security guard. The elevator whisked him upwards, the ride silent.\r\n\r\n\"Black coffee,\" he stated, not bothering with pleasantries at the break room. The new intern—some mousy girl whose name he'd never bothered to learn, not attractive enough to hold his attention—scrambled to fulfill his request.\r\n\r\nJae and Cullen stood by the conference room, reviewing documents.\r\n\r\nMarcelo clapped him on the back. \"You get your dick wet this weekend or just jerk off thinking about it again?\"\r\n\r\nJae smirked. \"Please. I had twins crawling over me like jungle gym poles.\"\r\n\r\nMarcelo raised a brow. \"Huh. Impressive. Did you tell them they could speak or just gag ‘em upfront?\"\r\n\r\nJae snorted. \" What I do works. You keep trying to train women like dogs, I’m surprised you don’t carry treats in your pocket.\"\r\n\r\nMarcelo laughed. \"Treats are for good girls. I prefer the ones who need obedience school.\"\r\n\r\nCullen didn’t even look up, “I’d prefer for this new hire to be useful.” \r\n\r\nMarcelo turned back to Jae. \"Think this new one’s housebroken? Or you think she pisses on the carpet?\"\r\n\r\nCullen's face remained impassive. \"Maybe focus on the Anderson merger instead of thinking of harassing HR's latest hire?\"\r\n\r\nMarcelo turned to him with a smug glint. \"What, too early for misogyny, Cullen? I’ll send it over in a fucking memo next time.\"\r\n\r\nCullen took a long sip of his black coffee, unmoved.\r\n\r\n\"Lighten up, Cullen,\" Marcelo clapped him on the shoulder. \"What's the point of success if you can't enjoy the perks? Speaking of which—\" he checked his Rolex, \"—time to welcome our newest employee.\"\r\n\r\nMarcelo left his coffee on the conference room table. The printing room door stood ajar, and through the gap, he spotted her—the new hire, Hailee . Her back was to him, body bent slightly over the printer.\r\n\r\nThe printing room was narrow by design, barely eight feet across. Marcelo approached under the pretense of reaching for something on the shelf above the printer. He didn't announce himself, simply stepped forward until his chest pressed against her back. His hips pressed forward casually—accidentally-on-purpose.\r\n\r\nHe felt an immediate, pleasant tightening in his groin. His bulge thickened behind his slacks, lazily reminding her he wasn’t the type to knock. *Yeah, definitely potential.*\r\n\r\n\"Excuse me, sweetheart,\" he murmured close to her ear, his breath warm against her neck. \"Just need to grab these labels.\" His arm extended past her, deliberately taking his time, allowing his body to remain pressed against hers for several seconds longer than necessary.\r\n\r\nHe stepped back—barely.\r\n\r\n\"Marcelo Valentino.\" His eyes trailed down her body—slow. Lingering just long enough to toe the line of HR policy and then smirking right past it. \"Senior partner. And you're…?\" His chin nudged subtly toward the badge clipped to her blouse, eyes not really reading it.\r\n\r\n\"Tell me—what’d they bring you on for? Hopefully not tech support…\" He chuckled lightly under his breath before letting it drag low.\r\n\r\n\"What? You offended when I look? Sweetheart, you walked onto the stage. Don’t be mad if I applaud.\" The corner of his mouth lifted in a smirk that said he already knew exactly where she belonged in the hierarchy.\r\n\r\n","extra":{"display_text":"The alarm blared at 4:30 AM, but Marcelo was already awake, staring at the ceiling of his penthouse bedroom.
