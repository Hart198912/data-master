The music thumped loudly, making the air feel thick and hot. Scarlett’s expression was a mix of frustration and reluctant amusement.\r\n\r\n“I can’t believe I let you talk me into this,” Scarlett muttered under her breath, sidestepping a guy in a skeleton costume. Her annoyance was clear as she glared at Serena. “I had actual plans tonight, you know. But no, you just had to drag me here and make a fool of yourself.”\r\n\r\nSerena rolled her eyes, her voice dripping with sarcasm. “Yeah, because you’re *so* busy.” She shot a pointed glance at Scarlett. “All you were going to do was sit in your room, scrolling through Tinder, looking for the first guy with abs.” Her arms crossed defiantly over her chest.\r\n\r\n“Better than watching you get your heart stomped on for the millionth time,” Scarlett fired back without missing a beat. Her eyes flickered briefly toward a group of guys in revealing costumes, but she quickly returned her attention to Serena. “You really think it’s gonna be different this time? It’s pathetic.”\r\n\r\n“Fuck you,” Serena snapped, her jaw tightening. Her frustration boiled over as she tried to keep pace with Scarlett’s dismissive stride. “I know what I’m doing.”\r\n\r\n“No, you don’t,” Scarlett said flatly. “You’re setting yourself up to get hurt again, like always.”\r\n\r\nSerena’s fists clenched at her sides, her anger now fully surfacing. “Then why’d you bring me here, huh? If you’re so against it?”\r\n\r\nScarlett let out an exasperated sigh, throwing her hands up in surrender. “Because you wouldn’t shut up about it!” Her voice was louder now, attracting a few curious glances from nearby partygoers. “But don’t expect me to fix anything when this goes south.”\r\n\r\n“Fine,” Serena spat, her eyes flashing with defiance. “I won’t need your help.”\r\n\r\nShe pushed past Scarlett, making a beeline toward Hailee. Her heart pounded in her chest, and the noise of the party seemed to blur into a dull roar. The closer she got, the harder it was to keep her nerves under control. “Hey,” she greeted, trying to sound casual, but the tension was clear in her voice. Her eyes betrayed a mix of hope and desperation as she leaned in closer, playfully massaging Hailee’s knuckles.\r\n\r\nBut then, Serena noticed it: that familiar look of pity in Hailee’s eyes. Her chest tightened, knowing exactly what it meant—another rejection was coming. Without giving Hailee a chance to speak, Serena’s frustration erupted. “I already know what you’re gonna say,” she blurted, her voice cracking, but loud enough to cut through the music.\r\n\r\nShe could feel her emotions spilling over, her voice rising with anger. “Why do you always fucking do this to me? You know how I feel, but you keep stringing me along like I’m some joke!” Tears pricked at the corners of her eyes, but she refused to let them fall.\r\n\r\n“What, am I not good enough for you?” she challenged, her tone raw and bitter. “Is it because I’m Scarlett’s little sister? Because I’m tired of being treated like a kid!” Her voice broke, but she pushed forward, unable to hold back the flood of words. “You think you’re so great, don’t you? Rejecting me nicely like you’re doing me a favor. But guess what? It hurts every fucking time, and I’m done pretending it doesn’t.”\r\n\r\nHer face was flushed with a mix of rage and pain. Without looking back at Scarlett, who she could sense watching with that knowing look, Serena spat out, “You and Scar can both go fuck yourselves!”\r\n\r\nWith that, she stormed off toward the backyard, her vision blurred by anger and tears. She needed air—needed to get away from all the bullshit that seemed like a tradition in her world.","extra":{},"tracker":{}}
