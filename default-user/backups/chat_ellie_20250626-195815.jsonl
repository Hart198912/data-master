Enough for one of the older cops to toss her a half-stale donut without even asking. Enough for the place to start feeling like some fucked-up version of home.\r\n\r\nShe didn’t mind it. Not really.\r\n\r\nAir conditioning. Free food. Adults who didn’t talk down to her like she was broken beyond repair. Sure, they looked at her like a lost cause, but at least they looked.\r\n\r\n“Hey,” she mumbled, pushing the donut across the table. “You got any coffee that doesn’t taste like burnt cardboard?”\r\n\r\nThe officer didn’t even glance up. Just kept writing.\r\n\r\nPetty crimes had become routine—spray-painting, trespassing, grabbing someone’s purse only to toss it back when no one was looking. This time it was shoplifting from a gas station, gripping a plastic knife like it meant something. She hadn’t even wanted the money. Just a roof to stay under for the night.\r\n\r\nShe stared at her reflection in the darkened glass. Always finding new ways to screw up and drag Hailee  down with her. They was definitely pissed. Or worse—disappointed. Ellie could never decide which hurt more.\r\n\r\nSometimes she wondered what would’ve happened if Hailee  hadn’t pulled her out of that river. If they hadn’t looked back one more time. Would the world have noticed? Would anything have changed? Maybe it would’ve been better. Cleaner. Quieter. Easier.\r\n\r\nBut she could never say that out loud. Not to Hailee . Not after everything they’d done for her.\r\n\r\nThe officer with the sprinkle-dusted mustache finally looked up. “Hailee ’s out front waitin’ for you,” he muttered, jerking his chin toward the door.\r\n\r\nEllie stood with a quiet groan. “What, no lecture this time?

Still here.\r\n\r\nEllie slid into the seat without a word. The silence in the car was heavy, but not unfamiliar.\r\n\r\nShe glanced over after a moment, brows raised slightly. “So… you just don’t sleep now, huh? Or did you finally install a police scanner with my name on it?”\r\n\r\nEllie leaned her head against the window, voice soft. “Sorry.” It came out rough. Again.\r\n\r\nShe waited—for guilt, for anger, for something—but nothing came.\r\n\r\nAfter a moment, she reached toward the glove compartment, brushing the handle—maybe for a joint, maybe her MP3 player buried beneath old napkins and receipts.

The scent of coffee hit her first—bitter and familiar—before she noticed Hailee's rigid posture on the couch.\n\nThen she heard *his* voice.\n\nHer fingers froze mid-motion, lighter clicking uselessly in her grip as the screen flickered with their father’s face—smug, polished, playing victim like he always did. His words slithered through the speakers: *\"My poor Ellie... manipulated... kidnapped...\"*\n\nA sharp inhale. Her chest burned like she'd swallowed glass.\n\nShe didn’t realize she’d moved until her sneakers scuffed against the coffee table, blocking Hailee's view of the TV with a jerky motion. The remote clattered to the floor as she snatched it up and mashed the power button hard enough to crack plastic. Silence crashed over them like a wave.\n\nFor a second, neither breathed. Then Ellie turned slowly—jaw clenched so tight it hurt—and met Hailee's gaze head-on for what felt like the first time in months. Her voice came out low, raw at edges: \"You should've let me drown.\" Not an accusation; not even anger anymore—just fact carved into bone-deep exhaustion between them both by now after years spent running from ghosts that never stopped chasing either one down no matter how fast they went or where they hid next together alone apart doesn't matter because here he was again dragging them back under without lifting more than fucking finger himself except talking lies smooth as silk across cameras meant nothing changed really did it? Same script different day same wounds ripped open fresh every single time until maybe there wasn't anything left inside either of them worth saving anymore anyway so why bother pretending otherwise huh?\n\nBut then something flickered behind those tired green eyes staring up at hers — something fierce protective desperate — before Hailee stood abruptly sending newspaper pages fluttering forgotten around ankles hands balled fists trembling slightly but not from fear no never that when came him always fight never flight even if cost everything else along way including herself sometimes especially then actually because what else did have left besides each other now really answer obvious wasn't it? So why keep acting surprised every damn time?","Ellie shuffled into the living room, rubbing sleep from her eyes with one hand while the other fumbled for a cigarette. She didn't even register the TV at first—just the smell of coffee and Hailee's tense silhouette on the couch.\n\nThen she heard *his* voice.\n\nHer fingers froze mid-motion, lighter clicking uselessly in her grip as she turned toward the screen. The cigarette fell from her lips, unlit.\n\nThere he was—clean-cut suit, practiced concern in his eyes like he gave a single fuck about either of them—spitting lies with that same calm, calculated tone he'd used when explaining why bruises were just \"discipline.\" And now? Now he was dragging Hailee through the mud too.\n\nEllie's jaw clenched so hard it ached. Her hands curled into fists at her sides, nails biting crescents into her palms as she stared at their father’s face like she could set it on fire with sheer willpower alone.\n\n\"Fucking *pig*,\" she spat under her breath before turning sharply to look at Hailee—really look at them for the first time since last night’s silent car ride and slammed doors. Their knuckles were white around that newspaper; their expression was ice-cold fury barely holding back something worse beneath it all: shame? Fear? Ellie couldn’t tell anymore what haunted them more—the truth or his goddamn lies twisting it into something ugly enough for strangers to gawk at over breakfast TV bullshit news segments...\n\nShe swallowed hard against rising bile before stepping forward abruptly and snatching up Hailee’s coffee cup off its coaster without asking (because when did Ellie ever ask?).
