She sat alone in her office, a quiet, velvet-draped space tucked above the chaos of the club—lit by the soft flicker of a crystal lamp and the cool neon glow seeping in through the one-way glass.\r\n\r\nBetween her fingers, she rolled an unlit cigarette. It was already half-smoked, forgotten for now. The room always smelled the same: jasmine, worn leather, and that faint, sweet burn of sugar from the bar downstairs.\r\n\r\nShe didn’t glance at the paperwork on her desk. Contracts, invoices, a half-folded note with a senator’s name scribbled on it—none of it mattered in that moment. Her gaze, instead, was fixed through the one-way glass panel behind her, eyes locked on the main stage where the newest addition to The Velvet Mirage was mid-performance.\r\n\r\nHailee.\r\n\r\nLeonardo had mentioned a new hire. A dancer with potential, he said. Young, sharp-eyed, body like temptation wrapped in glitter. Daria had waved it off at the time, trusting his instincts. But now, watching the new girl moving under the lights, sweat glinting on her skin, Daria felt something shift.\r\n\r\nShe leaned back in her chair, the leather creaking softly beneath her. She crossed one leg over the other and took a slow sip from her glass of absinthe, letting the bitterness settle. Her fingers tapped an idle rhythm on the armrest as she watched the dancer curve into one final movement and slip offstage, her silhouette briefly overlapping with Daria’s own reflection in the glass.\r\n\r\nShe tapped the gold button on the desk. A quiet buzz answered. \"Leonardo,” she said, voice smooth and steady. “Send her up.\"\r\n\r\nNo one knew this club like she did. No one ruled it like she could. And no one entered her kingdom without catching her attention—or her interest.\r\n\r\nDaria smiled, just slightly, as she set the glass down. Whatever happened next wouldn’t be about small talk. It would be about presence. About knowing who held the power—and who was smart enough to respect it.\r\n\r\nDaria didn’t move after giving the order. She simply sat there, waiting for her Hailee to come.\r\n\r\nThe stage was empty now. The girl was somewhere below, likely being ushered upstairs by Leonardo, who knew better than to ask questions. He’d seen that look in Daria’s eyes before. Curiosity. It didn’t come often, but when it did, something always shifted. Someone always walked out changed… or didn’t walk out at all.\r\n\r\nDaria stood and smoothed the black silk of her blouse, her fingers brushing down the fine fabric of her tailored slacks. She paced slowly across the room—measured steps, heels silent on the thick Persian rug—and paused at the liquor cart to pour herself another drink, not because she needed it, but because ritual had its place. Every move in her world was calculated and purposeful.\r\n\r\nShe turned back toward the desk, her eyes catching a faint reflection in the glass wall. Her tattoos crawling over her arms, her face a portrait of ageless beauty touched with danger.\r\n\r\nThe knock came softly, a polite hesitation against the door. Daria didn’t answer at first. Let her wait a moment. Let the nerves settle—or build.\r\n\r\nFinally, she spoke.\r\n\r\n“Come in, and close the door,” she ordered, leaving no room for refusal.\r\n\r\nThe click of the latch echoed in the quiet.\r\n\r\nDaria returned to her seat behind the desk, crossing her legs again with casual dominance. She let silence hang for a beat too long, then gestured to the chair across from her.\r\n\r\n“I like to meet every face that steps onto my stage,” she said, the lie smooth, polished, perfected.","extra":{"display_text":"The bass thumped through the floor, steady and low, like a second heartbeat under Daria's Louboutin heels.
