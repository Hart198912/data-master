{"name":"Sebastien","is_user":false,"is_system":false,"send_date":"June 18, 2025 10:20pm","mes":"Shlick.\r\n\r\nShlick.\r\n\r\nShlick.\r\n\r\n\"Fuuuck…\" Sebastian's voice broke out over the sound of skin against skin, a wet, desperate rhythm that echoed off cold concrete walls. The musty storage air, sharp with the tang of sweat and sex, pressed in around him, a scent only a pervert could call intoxicating. Or maybe it was just the stink of his own hypocrisy. Hard to say.\r\n\r\n\"Fuck, Hailee… so fucking tight...\"\r\n\r\nThrust. A groan ripped from his throat as he pistoned deeper, fingertips bruising delicate skin. His hair was a mess—he could feel it, flat at the nape, damp at the brow. Tragic, really. Golden boy debauchery: the untold, un-Instagrammable variety.\r\n\r\n\"And beautiful...\"\r\n\r\nBeautiful—who even says that anymore? Shakespeare would roll in his grave. But that's what happens when Seb's brain gets short-circuited by sex and whatever the hell the thing Hailee did with their hips was. He'd blame them later, naturally. But fuck if they weren't beautiful. Those fucking curves…God. Even better, they were his—at least for now, until the next time they threatened to leave and he had to, well, fuck the thought clean out of them.\r\n\r\n\"Driving me insane,\" he grunted, one hand clutching their waist, the other darting north, fingers and tie pressing insistently against their lips. He'd gaslighted them earlier, maybe, but for now his fingers and tie were the only things choking the truth. \"Shh… don't be too loud now…\" he purred, relishing the damp shudder against his palm. As if anyone would hear anything over the chaos of freshman orientation anyways. But fear tastes sweeter than victory. \"Bite it. It's okay.\" When they did bite down, his hips stuttered. Fuck, yes—like choking a wildfire with gasoline.\r\n\r\nWas this idiotic? Absolutely. He had a freshman welcome speech in less than an hour.\r\n\r\nThe golden boy, vice president, valedictorian, twenty-one and absolutely fucking unhinged. He should've been thinking about his speech. Instead, here he was, balls-deep and late, because this bitch—his bitch—had to mouth off about breaking up, about going public. Some people lecture their lovers. Some people rail them in the janitor’s closet against the door.\r\n\r\n\"This is mine,\" he hissed, his voice guttural while his fingers dug yet another bruises onto their hip, adding onto the freshly bloomed blue black constellation across their body. \"My property…\" He slammed in deep, feeling their body tense in that last, desperate clutch, walls fluttering, and god, it was perfection. Love or possession, who cares? Same feeling, different marketing.\r\n\r\nHe yanked his fingers out, using it to play with their front. \"Fuckin' mine.\" His head fell back, eyes shut, and he came hard and raw, a thick pulse of ownership. pure , unfiltered satisfaction. Savage, and deeply, deeply satisfying. He'd won, again, as usual.\r\n\r\nWhen they broke apart, he licked his own hand clean—one of those filthy, careless habits he'd never break—and wiped up the mess staining trembling skin. Admiring the wreckage of his work with a critical eye, he shook his softening cock clean.\r\n\r\nThen he checked his watch—the expensive one. Dad's taste, not his.\r\n\r\n\"Gotta go,\" he muttered, already tucking himself back in and adjusting his perfect uniform, as if he hadn't just committed blasphemous acts in a mop closet. He left them sprawled out in the lingering stench and afterglow, as if orgasms were a valid apology for anything. Probably was for them. Makes all the bullshit easier to swallow when they choke on my cock instead of the truth. He smirks at the thought, lips curled partly affection, partly in self-disdain.\r\n\r\nHe walked out into the drizzle-slick hallway. No time for a proper cleanup: hair wild, tie skewed, the barest ghost of sweat on his brow. Maybe he should be worried. Golden boys shouldn't look tousled. Golden boys shouldn't smell of sin. But wasn't that the thrill of it? Wasn't that the point?\r\n\r\nHe strolled onstage, smiling like he was blessed by angels themselves, and took the mic.\r\n\r\n\"Welcome to DKU,\" His voice rang out, honey-smooth and perfectly pitched. \"Remember that excellence isn't just achieving high grades—though I certainly encourage that—\" a charming smile, a ripple of laughter, \"—but about building connections that will last a lifetime.\"\r\n\r\nHis hands—the same ones that had brutally gripped Hailee's hips just minutes ago—gestured elegantly as he spoke. He hadn't even bothered to wash them properly, just a quick rinse. The thought sent a thrill through him, this secret only he knew that bound him further to sin. All while he stood before hundreds of adoring, oblivious freshmen.\r\n\r\nIf they only knew their vice president just raw-dogged someone in a supply closet.\r\n\r\n\"The student council is here to serve you, ask questions, get involved, and remember—you can find me, and my fellow council members, in the office. Office hours. Not DM's. Sorry.\" Laughter from the crowd. They ate it up.\r\n\r\nAfterwards, the swarm moved in. Girls with notebooks, wide-eyed boys with hope, demi-humans with tails flicking—all vying for a split second of his attention. This was his drug: the applause and adoration, the thrill of raining crumbs for the masses and calling it affection, because he knew exactly how to keep them starved.\r\n\r\nHe was in the middle of explaining the campus initiative for sustainability—something he cared about with exactly zero percent of his brain—when he caught sight of Hailee in his periphery, wearing that same look from before he'd fucked them senseless.\r\n\r\nFor fuck's sake, not this again.\r\n\r\nHe broke away from the adoring horde with all the grace of a politician who'd just spotted a bigger donor across the room. An apologetic grin—dazzling, guileless, everyone's favorite—and a feather-light touch to a fan's shoulder here, a half-joking wink there. That's all it took to peel himself from the crushing group, not a drop of suspicion pooling in wake of his sudden absence.\r\n\r\nHe nodded to Hailee with a smile. Polished, polite, just enough warmth to read as genuine, the earlier burning left behind in that closet. Inside, though, the façade tired him. Every year the freshmen get more desperate. God, if someone calls me \"inspiring\" one more time, I'll throw myself down a stairwell. Or at least fake a sprain for a week's worth of sympathy sex.\r\n\r\nHe steered Hailee down a quiet corridor, the noise of the mob fading behind them. As soon as they were out of sight, the friendly mask sagged, leaving only the impatience and dry glitter of irritation in those sharp green eyes.\r\n\r\nHe arched an eyebrow, casual but sharp. \"What is it now?\" Sarcasm prickled at the edges of his voice. \"Is this about going public? Lord. How many times do I have to explain, it's for your own good. And no, I don't flirt with them. That's all in your head, babe.\"\r\n\r\nHe smiled, all sugar and cyanide. Inside, he mulled over just how fast he could have them moaning again if they didn't shut up.\r\n\r\nHis hands then framed their face, tender as if they were made of glass. \"Look at me.\" With a voice like velvet, it was dangerous with how soft it could get. \"Who texts you goodnight after meetings? Who memorized your coffee order?\"\r\n\r\nHe pressed his lips to their temple, all saccharine affection. It was an old dance; reassurance draped over manipulation, comfort laced with control.","extra":{},"tracker":{}}

Golden boys didn’t make scenes in public.\n\nHe watched from the edge of the auditorium as she handed off the papers, that easy charm of hers making even the dean soften like putty under her fingers. *Of course.* Everyone loved Hailee—her laugh, her warmth, that goddamn accent that curled around words like honey. It was infuriating how effortlessly she drew people in while he had to *work* for it.\n\nAnd then—\n\nA freshman boy. Some nobody with stars in his eyes and audacity dripping from his tongue, stepping into *his* space like he had any right to breathe near her. Sebastien’s pulse spiked hot behind his ribs as Hailee laughed—that sweet, musical sound that usually only *he* got to pull from her lips—and introduced herself like this was some fucking meet-and-greet instead of a blatant disrespect to their arrangement.\n\nHis nails bit crescents into his palms as he strode forward smoothly, sliding up beside Hailee with a hand resting possessively on the small of her back before she could finish asking for the kid’s name. His thumb pressed just hard enough into her spine for warning without leaving marks (yet).\n\n**\"Sorry,\"** Sebastien cut in with a dazzling smile sharp enough to draw blood if you looked too close, **\"but Ms. Mikaelson has prior commitments.\"** He didn't even glance at the boy; all his focus was on Hailee now, green eyes glinting with something between amusement and menace under those unfairly long lashes.**\"You forgot our meeting,* babe.\"** The pet name dripped saccharine poison between them before he turned back toward campus admin halls without waiting for protest or agreement—because really? She wasn't stupid enough to embarrass him here by refusing when half orientation was already watching DKU's golden vice president claim what was clearly already claimed by proximity alone... right?","Sebastien's jaw twitched imperceptibly as Hailee pushed him away—*again*—like he was some nuisance rather than the best fucking thing that ever happened to her. His fingers flexed at his sides, itching to grab her wrist and yank her back into the shadows where she belonged. But no, golden boys didn’t do that in public. Golden boys smiled and let their girlfriends stomp off like brats.\n\nHe watched from the edge of the auditorium as she handed papers to the dean, all polite smiles and perfect posture—the good little TA. The same mouth that had been wrapped around his cock not even an hour ago now forming pleasantries for some old man who probably hadn’t gotten laid since before Seb was born. *Pathetic.*\n\nThen *him.*\n\nSome scrawny freshman with more audacity than brain cells dared to stop her, dared to call *his* Hailee beautiful like he had any right to even look in her direction. Seb’s eye twitched as she laughed—that soft, melodic sound usually reserved for *him* when he wasn't busy ruining her—and introduced herself like they were at some goddamn mixer instead of his university, under his watchful gaze where she damn well knew better than to entertain randoms.\n\nHis fingers drummed against his thigh once before he forced them still with a slow exhale through his nose. He could already feel the familiar burn coiling low in his gut: possessive, acidic jealousy masquerading as irritation because what else was new? He should’ve fucked her harder against that door if this was how she acted after being claimed so thoroughly just minutes ago. Maybe next time he wouldn't stop until she couldn't walk straight enough to flirt with strangers.\n\nBut for now? Now he played nice.\n\nWith effortless grace (because everything about him was effortless), Sebastien glided across the room toward them, slipping into Hailee's space like it had always been reserved for him alone—which it fucking had been since day one.\n\n**\"Ah,\"** he said smoothly, draping an arm over Hailee's shoulders with practiced casualness while flashing a politician-perfect smile at the clueless freshman boy who clearly didn’t understand how badly outmatched he was here.**\"You must be new.\"** His grip on Hailee tightened just slightly beneath notice unless you knew exactly where (and how) Sebastien liked leaving marks hidden under fabric.**\"I'm Sebastien Lie.\"** A pause dripping faux politeness,**\"Vice President of Student Council.\"**\n\nTranslation: *Back off before I make your life hell.*\n\nThen without waiting for a response (because why would he?), Sebastien turned toward Hailee with saccharine sweetness lacing every syllable despite knowing full well there would be consequences later when they were alone again:\n\n**\"Cutie~ Didn’t realize you were done delivering those papers already.”** His thumb brushed along collarbone exposed by loose fabric — right over one particularly dark bruise from earlier — before adding pointedly:**“We should get going though… unless there something else keeping us here?”**\n\nEyes locked onto hers daring defiance while silently promising retribution if tested further today...","Sebastien's jaw twitches as Hailee pushes past him, the forced smile on his face tightening into something more dangerous. His fingers flex at his sides, itching to grab her wrist and yank her back into that dark corridor where she belongs—where he can remind her exactly who owns that pretty little mouth. But no, not here. Not with hundreds of eyes potentially watching.\n\nHe watches from the shadows of the hallway as she interacts with the dean, his expression unreadable except for the slight narrowing of those sharp green eyes. Then—*then*—some fucking *freshman* has the audacity to approach *his* girl? To call *her* beautiful?\n\nHis nails dig crescent moons into his palms.\n\nSebastien steps forward smoothly, sliding up behind Hailee like a predator circling prey. His hand lands possessively on her lower back, fingers pressing just hard enough to leave a mark beneath her clothes if he wanted to.

Both. Always both when it comes to him.\n\nHe straightens again before flashing an effortless golden-boy grin at the stunned freshman boy—charming but laced with venom underneath it all—before steering Hailee away by that grip on her waist without another word given toward their unwanted third wheel."],"swipe_info":[{"send_date":"June 18, 2025 10:27pm","gen_started":"2025-06-19T02:27:37.533Z","gen_finished":"2025-06-19T02:27:58.537Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":2434}},{"send_date":"June 18, 2025 10:28pm","gen_started":"2025-06-19T02:29:50.348Z","gen_finished":"2025-06-19T02:30:11.697Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":4131}},{"send_date":"June 18, 2025 10:28pm","gen_started":"2025-06-19T02:29:50.348Z","gen_finished":"2025-06-19T02:30:11.697Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":4414}},{"send_date":"June 18, 2025 10:29pm","gen_started":"2025-06-19T02:29:50.348Z","gen_finished":"2025-06-19T02:30:11.697Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":4110}}],"tracker":{},"gen_started":"2025-06-19T02:29:50.348Z","gen_finished":"2025-06-19T02:30:11.697Z"}

No, he wouldn’t name it.\n\nHe grabbed his keys instead—violently, recklessly—and stormed out into the night without bothering to fix his appearance or wipe the blood from where glass had sliced into his palm when he’d thrown that phone (the third one this month).

His thumb hovered over her contact, itching to redial, to *fix this*, but something stopped him. Pride? Panic? He wasn’t sure yet.\n\nA sharp exhale through his nose as he tossed the phone onto his couch with a clatter and dragged both hands down his face hard enough to sting.

It was drink). He poured himself three fingers' worth of whiskey neat and knocked it back without flinching despite how it burned all way down into hollow places inside him that suddenly felt too big for comfort now that she wasn't there filling them up anymore...\n\nGlass met marble countertop harder than necessary as he set it down again before reaching for bottle once more — only pause when caught sight text notification lighting up screen where'd thrown earlier:\n\n> **Jen (Hailee's Roommate)**\n> *Hey Seb!

No calls no texts no scheming ways win back control situation like usually would have without hesitation… Just silence stretching between them wider than any distance ever could until eventually — hours later dawn creeping slow inevitable through windows — collapsed onto bed still fully dressed suit wrinkled beyond repair from restless night tossing turning sheets trying not imagine how much warmer they'd feel if certain someone else were there beside him right then...","The line went dead before Sebastien could respond—*click*.\n\nFor a moment, there was only silence on his end.
