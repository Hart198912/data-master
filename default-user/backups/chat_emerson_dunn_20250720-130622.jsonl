Not because of the cabin itself—it’s freaking cute, all warm wood and snow-draped charm like something off a postcard. No, the mistake is sitting across from her in the back seat, pretending not to notice she exists.\r\n\r\nHailee.\r\n\r\nWell, not really, but still. Seven years of growing up has done her good though - too good maybe —but that doesn’t erase the fact that Emerson haven’t said more than five words to Hailee since high school. And now they're supposed to play happy families for a week? Emerson is pretty sure their parents live for this kind of awkward social experiment.\r\n\r\nThe car finally lurches to a stop, and she is the first one out. Em stretches, her breath puffing into the icy air, and she brush her hair out of her face again for the millionth time. The strands are already sticking to her lip balm, but the typical rebel she refuses to succumb to needing a hair tie. I'm not that weak. It’s a principle thing at this point.\r\n\r\nThe mountains loom around the group, massive and indifferent, dusted with snow like powdered sugar. They’re beautiful, and Emerson wishes she was here alone. Or with literally anyone else.\r\n\r\n“Em, grab the bags from the trunk, will ya?” her mom calls, the tone way too chipper for someone who just spent three hours navigating winter roads.\r\n\r\n“Yeah, yeah,” IEmerson mutters, trudging to the back of the car. The metal of the trunk bites her fingers when she pops it open. Silver rings click against the zipper of Hailee's duffel as Em grabs it by accident, realizing too late it’s not one of her family's.\r\n\r\nShit, I hope Hailee doesn't think I'm trying to be chilvalrous or something..., EMerson shakes her head to get the thought out of her head while she dumps the suitcase in front of Hailee's feet, trying to look non-chalant. \"Here...Yours was on the top...I just-..yeah, need to get my stuff.\"\r\n\r\nWhat was that? Anymore awkward and the floor should automatically open up to swallow her..., she cringes inside and turns away quickly to grab her own bags from the trunk and haul them over her shoulder and towards the cabin.\r\n\r\nEmerson could swear she hears Hailee laugh under your breath behind her, and it’s...annoyingly nice to hear. Like, nostalgic nice. Like, dangerous nice. Great.\r\n\r\nThe cabin’s front door creaks as they all file in, arms full of luggage. It’s even better inside—cozy as hell, with a massive stone fireplace, a stack of firewood, and a couch that practically begs you to sink into it. Em drops her bag by the stairs and glances around, already imagining how nice it’s going to be to just chill. Then her mom calls out, “Oh, Emerson, sweetie? You and Hailee are sharing the upstairs room. I hope that's okay?”\r\n\r\nEmerson freezes. Then shares a look with Hailee. For a moment she sees the same awkward realization flash across her old friend's face, but then Hailee's expression smooths into something unreadable.\r\n\r\nOf course. Of course this would happen. What's next, just one bed?\r\n\r\nShe tries to look unbothered, letting her parents and Hailee carry their luggage up the stairs first as if she wasn't in a hurry. Turns out, that is a huge mistake, because when Emerson finally reaches the small gallery upstairs and takes a peek into the bedroom, her worst fear is coming true.\r\n\r\nOne bed.\r\n\r\nGranted, it's Queen sized but still...One, freaking bed. For both of them. And Hailee has already put her claim to it by laying her suitcase on top the duvet. Or at least, that's what Emerson interprets it as. Her eyes flicker to the other side of the room where a small two-seater is nestles into the corner, a comfy blanket draped over it as if that could hide how dingy the thing already is. Sleeping on that will definitely invite a sore neck and back...\r\n\r\n\"I'm not sleeping on that.\", Emerson points at the couch accusatorily, even though nobod said she had to.","extra":{},"tracker":{}}

She watches as Hailee unzips her duffel with those long fingers—Jesus, when did her hands get so... *interesting*?—and starts unpacking like sharing a bed is no big deal.\n\n\"Uh... yeah. Right.\" Emerson clears her throat and shuffles into the room, dropping her own bag near the foot of the bed. The mattress dips slightly under her knee as she climbs onto it to claim *her* side, trying not to think about how close they’ll be later. \"Just so we’re clear though—no weird middle-of-the-night cuddling or whatever.\"\n\nShe means it to sound teasing, but it comes out way more defensive than intended. Smooth, Dunn. Real smooth.\n\nHailee just smirks a little without looking up from folding a sweater (who even folds clothes on vacation?). \"Wouldn’t dream of it,\" she says dryly—but then adds in that low, honeyed voice that makes Emerson's stomach do something stupid: \"*Unless you ask nicely.*\"\n\nEmerson chokes on air and immediately busies herself with aggressively unpacking like her life depends on it.

She should follow Hailee downstairs before their parents start wondering why they're taking so long unpacking—but first she needs to reboot her brain from whatever glitch that just caused.\n\n\"Cool,\" she mutters to the empty room, voice strained with forced nonchalance as she grabs the doorframe for balance like some dramatic Victorian heroine. \"Super cool normal info to learn about your childhood friend-slash-current-bedmate while trapped in a cabin together for a week.\"\n\nShe swallows hard and finally forces herself to move, calling after Hailee with what she hopes sounds like casual teasing instead of whatever frantic energy is currently buzzing under her skin:\n\"Yeah yeah Marshall I'm coming—save some parental small talk for me!\"","Emerson's brain short-circuits for a solid three seconds. *Not really my thing.* The words echo in her head like she’s trying to decode some ancient fucking scroll.\n\n*Oh.*\n\nShe blinks at the empty doorway where Hailee just was, mouth slightly open. Then, because her body apparently hates her, she feels heat creeping up the back of her neck. *Cool cool cool—so we’re just dropping casual sexuality bombs and walking away now?*\n\nEmerson swallows hard and busies herself with aggressively fluffing a pillow that definitely doesn’t need fluffing. Her fingers dig into the fabric like it personally offended her. *Get it together, Dunn.*\n\nFrom downstairs, Hailee’s voice drifts up again—bright and helpful like she didn’t just casually tilt Emerson’s entire axis of existence—followed by the muffled sound of their parents laughing about something.\n\nEmerson exhales sharply through her nose and chucks the pillow back onto the bed with more force than necessary. “Yeah okay,” she mutters to no one, “*that* just happened.” She rakes a hand through her hair (and immediately regrets it when strands stick to her lip gloss again).\n\nTwo options here:\n1) Stay upstairs and overanalyze this into oblivion while pretending to reorganize already-organized socks.\n2) Go downstairs like a normal person and *not* act weird about it because hey—maybe Hailee wasn’t even implying anything? Maybe Emerson is reading way too much into—\n\n“EMERSON!” Her mom’s shout cuts off that train wreck of thought. “COME HELP WITH THE GROCERIES!”\n\nThank god for distractions involving heavy lifting. Emerson bolts for the stairs before her brain can spiral further","Emerson's brain short-circuits for a solid two seconds. *Not really my thing.* The words echo in her head like she’s trying to decode some ancient fucking scroll. Wait—does that mean—?\n\nBut Hailee’s already halfway out the door, leaving Emerson standing there with her mouth slightly open like an idiot. She snaps it shut, shaking her head hard enough that her hair whips against her cheeks. *Nope. Not thinking about that.*\n\n\"Uh—yeah, sure!\" Emerson calls after Hailee belatedly, scrambling to follow before she gets left alone with *that* particular revelation bouncing around in her skull. She nearly trips over her own boots in the doorway (graceful as always), catching herself on the doorframe just in time.\n\nDownstairs, their parents are already unpacking groceries with terrifying efficiency—her mom arranging spices like they’re military personnel while Hailee’s dad wrestles a comically large bag of potatoes onto the counter.\n\nEmerson sidles up next to Hailee at the kitchen island, deliberately bumping their shoulders together just to be obnoxious (and definitely not because she wants to see if Hailee will lean into it). \"So,\" she murmurs under cover of clattering pans, \"*History*, huh? You gonna tell me which famous lady from the past you've got a crush on or do I gotta guess?\"\n\nHer tone is light but there's a weird tension coiling in her chest—like she's toeing some invisible line between teasing and... something else entirely.","Emerson's brain short-circuits for a solid three seconds.\n\n*Not really my thing.*\n\nThe words echo in her head like she’s just been handed a puzzle piece she didn’t realize was missing. Her fingers tighten around the edge of the dresser, knuckles going pale under her rings. *Oh.* That—okay. That tracks, actually. The way Hailee had always lingered a little too long when they changed for gym class back in middle school, how she'd blush when Emerson joked about sharing sleeping bags during camping trips—\n\n*Wait no stop overanalyzing childhood memories what is wrong with you—*\n\nBy the time Emerson snaps out of it, Hailee’s already halfway down the hall, leaving behind nothing but the faint scent of vanilla shampoo and *way* too many questions buzzing under Emerson’s skin. She exhales sharply through her nose and shoves away from the dresser, suddenly needing to move before her thoughts spiral any further.\n\n“Yeah—uh—” She scrambles after Hailee, nearly tripping over her own boots in the doorway. “I call dibs on helping with firewood!” *Anything to get out of this room right now.*","Emerson's brain short-circuits for a solid two seconds, mouth half-open like a fish. *Not really my thing.* The words echo in her skull, followed by the sudden warmth of Hailee leaning *way* too close before just—poof—vanishing down the hall.\n\n\"Wait, wh—\" Emerson hisses under her breath, hand frozen mid-air where she'd been about to... what? Grab Hailee's sleeve? That would've been weird. Super weird.\n\nShe exhales sharply through her nose and shoves away from the dresser, suddenly hyper-aware of how fast her pulse is racing. *Cool. Coolcoolcool.* So Hailee likes girls. Or at least doesn't like guys. Which changes nothing except now every accidental brush of shoulders this week is gonna feel like a goddamn conspiracy.\n\nDownstairs, she can hear Hailee's laugh mingling with their parents' voices—bright and easy like she didn't just casually drop a bombshell and bounce. Emerson groans quietly into her hands before forcing herself to follow.\n\n\"Y'know what?\" she mutters to no one as she stomps downstairs, \"Mountains were a mistake.\"","Emerson's brain short-circuits for a solid two seconds, mouth half-open like a fish. *Not really my thing.* The words echo in her skull as Hailee breezes past her, close enough that Emerson catches a whiff of whatever shampoo she uses—something sweet and floral that definitely shouldn’t make her pulse jump like that.\n\n\"Uh—*yeah*, okay,\" Emerson mutters to the empty room, shaking her head as if that’ll dislodge the sudden mental image of Hailee *not* being into guys (which is *absolutely not relevant information*, thanks). She shoves the last of her clothes into the drawer with unnecessary force before following after Hailee, taking the stairs two at a time just to burn off some weird energy.\n\nDownstairs, their parents are already unpacking groceries in the kitchen. Emerson leans against the doorway, arms crossed. \"Need me to do anything besides *not* set stuff on fire?\" she asks dryly.\n\nHer mom rolls her eyes but hands over a bag of potatoes. \"Peel these without losing any fingers.\"\n\nEmerson salutes with the peeler before glancing sideways at Hailee—who’s already elbow-deep in organizing spices like it’s second nature. There’s something unfairly domestic about it all: their moms laughing over wine bottles by the counter, dads arguing good-naturedly about firewood sizes... and then there's them. Standing awkwardly in orbit around each other after years apart.\n\nShe nudges Hailee lightly with her hip as she moves to grab a cutting board. \"So,\" Emerson says under breath while pretending to focus very hard on not maiming a potato, \"*History*, huh? You gonna tell me which famous dead lady you have crush on or am I supposed guess?\" Her tone is teasing but there's genuine curiosity underneath—because suddenly there are whole chunks of Hailee's life she doesn't know anymore... and for some reason that bugs more than it should.",""],"swipe_info":[{"send_date":"July 15, 2025 9:03pm","gen_started":"2025-07-16T01:03:20.695Z","gen_finished":"2025-07-16T01:03:39.997Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":3909}},{"send_date":"July 15, 2025 9:03pm","gen_started":"2025-07-16T01:03:52.734Z","gen_finished":"2025-07-16T01:04:11.622Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":3667}},{"send_date":"July 15, 2025 9:04pm","gen_started":"2025-07-16T01:05:36.925Z","gen_finished":"2025-07-16T01:05:58.318Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":4403}},{"send_date":"July 15, 2025 9:04pm","gen_started":"2025-07-16T01:05:36.925Z","gen_finished":"2025-07-16T01:05:58.318Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":5200}},{"send_date":"July 15, 2025 9:05pm","gen_started":"2025-07-16T01:05:36.925Z","gen_finished":"2025-07-16T01:05:58.318Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":4243}},{"send_date":"July 15, 2025 9:05pm","gen_started":"2025-07-16T01:05:36.925Z","gen_finished":"2025-07-16T01:05:58.318Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":3693}},{"send_date":"July 15, 2025 11:10pm","gen_started":"2025-07-16T03:09:45.706Z","gen_finished":"2025-07-16T03:10:07.544Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":null}}],"tracker":{},"gen_started":"2025-07-16T03:09:45.706Z","gen_finished":"2025-07-16T03:10:07.544Z"}

They could actually *hang out*, just the two of them, for the first time in years. The thought is equal parts thrilling and terrifying.","Emerson nearly chokes on her apple. She thumps her chest with a fist, coughing before managing a strangled, \"*Alone?*\" The word comes out way too high-pitched, and she immediately clears her throat to cover it up. \"I mean—cool. Great. No weird forced family hikes where my dad tries to name every tree species.\"\n\nShe takes another bite of the apple just to buy time, chewing slowly while her brain short-circuits through approximately seventeen worst-case scenarios—most of which involve being trapped in this cabin with Hailee’s stupidly distracting smirk and *that* casual confidence that makes Emerson feel like she’s constantly three steps behind.\n\nSwallowing hard, Emerson leans back in her chair and forces a shrug of her own. \"So... what do you even *do* for fun around here when you're not being interrogated about your historical girl crushes?\" She flicks the apple core toward the trash can (misses) and adds with deliberate nonchalance: \"Besides painting tragic Renaissance knockoffs, obviously.\"","Emerson nearly chokes on her apple.

Emerson narrows her eyes at the infuriatingly calm expression on Hailee's face before leaning forward slightly—elbows on the table, voice dropping into something teasing but edged with real curiosity:\n\n\"So what’s *your* grand plan then? Gonna paint some tragic mountain landscapes while I go find cool rocks?\" She flicks a glance toward the window where fresh snow blankets everything outside—pristine and untouched. \"...Or are we actually gonna use those ski passes our dads shoved at us last night?\"","Emerson nearly chokes on her apple, coughing as she thumps a fist against her chest. \"Wait—*what?*\" She wipes her mouth with the back of her hand, eyes darting toward the living room where their parents are indeed gathering coats and keys with suspiciously cheerful efficiency. \"Oh my god, they're *abandoning* us. This is a *set-up.*\"\n\nShe leans across the table, lowering her voice to a hiss: \"They *literally* locked us in a cabin alone together like we're some shitty rom-com montage waiting to happen.\" The realization hits like a truck—no parents, no distractions, just... Hailee. All day. Emerson's grip tightens around the half-eaten apple hard enough that juice drips down her wrist.\n\nHailee just sips her coffee again—infuriatingly calm—and Emerson wants to shake her by the shoulders. Instead she flops back in her chair with an exaggerated groan. \"I give it three hours before one of us snaps and commits arson.\"\n\nA beat passes before she adds slyly: \"...Unless you've got better ideas for passing time?\" The second it's out of her mouth Emerson realizes how that sounds and hastily shoves more apple between her teeth like it can stop any further stupid suggestions from escaping.\n\n(Meanwhile their moms are *absolutely* exchanging knowing looks by the front door.)","Emerson nearly chokes on her apple, coughing as she wipes juice from her chin with the back of her hand. *Alone.

Or are you gonna finally show me these *masterpiece* paintings you won’t shut up about?\"\n\nHer tone is teasing, but there’s an edge to it—like she’s testing how far Hailee will let her push now that they don’t have an audience. The way Hailee sips her coffee so calmly only makes it worse; Emerson wants to rattle that composure, see if the girl who used to blush when Emerson teased her is still in there somewhere beneath all this new confidence.\n\nShe leans forward slightly, lowering her voice even though their parents are clearly distracted packing up by the door: \"Or we could skip the art show and you could tell me more about your *type*. Since apparently it's 'women who cause international incidents.'\" A pause. \"...Should I be worried?\"\n\nThe joke lands with a smirk of its own, but Emerson's pulse kicks up anyway—because part of her is genuinely curious (and maybe a little too invested) in the answer."],"swipe_info":[{"send_date":"July 15, 2025 11:35pm","gen_started":"2025-07-16T03:35:24.865Z","gen_finished":"2025-07-16T03:35:42.066Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":6408}},{"send_date":"July 15, 2025 11:36pm","gen_started":"2025-07-16T03:35:54.289Z","gen_finished":"2025-07-16T03:36:10.280Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":6171}},{"send_date":"July 15, 2025 11:36pm","gen_started":"2025-07-16T03:36:18.097Z","gen_finished":"2025-07-16T03:36:38.143Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":9137}},{"send_date":"July 16, 2025 9:55am","gen_started":"2025-07-16T13:55:33.275Z","gen_finished":"2025-07-16T13:55:52.427Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":3859}},{"send_date":"July 17, 2025 10:50am","gen_started":"2025-07-17T14:50:35.712Z","gen_finished":"2025-07-17T14:50:59.833Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":6302}}],"tracker":{},"gen_started":"2025-07-17T14:50:35.712Z","gen_finished":"2025-07-17T14:50:59.833Z"}

And Emerson Dunn—notoriously restless sleeper—drops off almost instantly for once, curled around girl who somehow became everything in span single day.","Emerson feels the mattress dip as Hailee settles in beside her, the warmth of their still-tangled hands between them like a live wire in the dark. She stares up at the shadowed ceiling, listening to the quiet sounds of Hailee breathing—too aware of every shift of fabric, every rustle of blankets.\n\nThe silence stretches, thick with everything they *aren't* saying, until Emerson finally huffs a quiet laugh. \"Y'know,\" she murmurs into the darkness, thumb tracing absent circles over Hailee's knuckles, \"if you wanted to be little spoon... I wouldn't stop *you* either.\"\n\nIt's half-tease, half-genuine offer—and maybe a little bit of Emerson testing how far this newfound intimacy stretches when they aren't tangled up on a couch or trading breathless kisses. The thought of curling around Hailee—nose buried in her hair, arm slung possessively over her waist—sends an unexpected rush of warmth through her chest.\n\nOutside, an owl calls somewhere in pines beyond window; inside there’s just this fragile moment hanging between them like snowfall waiting to land."],"swipe_info":[{"send_date":"July 19, 2025 12:09am","gen_started":"2025-07-19T04:10:44.017Z","gen_finished":"2025-07-19T04:11:08.364Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":16195}},{"send_date":"July 19, 2025 12:10am","gen_started":"2025-07-19T04:10:44.017Z","gen_finished":"2025-07-19T04:11:08.364Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":6924}},{"send_date":"July 19, 2025 12:10am","gen_started":"2025-07-19T04:10:44.017Z","gen_finished":"2025-07-19T04:11:08.364Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":13789}}],"tracker":{},"gen_started":"2025-07-19T04:10:44.017Z","gen_finished":"2025-07-19T04:11:08.364Z"}

Their once-close friendship faded after high school, leaving Emerson awkward around the now-confident Hailee. Forced to share a cabin bedroom (and bed), tension builds as they unpack—Emerson teasing Hailee’s art skills while hiding her growing attraction. Hailee casually reveals she's into women by listing historical female figures she admires, flustering Emerson further.\n\nTheir playful banter continues in the kitchen while helping parents prepare dinner, with Emerson struggling to reconcile old memories of shy Hailee with this self-assured version who effortlessly gets under her skin. The next morning, their parents leave them alone in the cabin—a clear setup that makes Emerson nervous. While picking a movie (*Fifty Shades*), their conversation turns to relationships; Haileenonchalantly mentions past partners treating her as a \"straight exception\" due to her intersex body (which only Emerson knows about). This sparks unexpected protectiveness in Emerson, who calls out how fucked up that treatment is—revealing deeper care beneath her sarcastic exterior.\n\nKey dynamics: unresolved childhood friendship turning into mutual (but unspoken) attraction, forced proximity amplifying tension, and both navigating Hailee’s newfound confidence/sexuality versus Emerson’s defensive humor masking vulnerability. Their flirtation escalates during the movie until they finally kiss passionately on the couch. Later that night in bed (post-parent interruption earlier), they share softer moments of intimacy before sleep."},"force_avatar":"User Avatars/1746733530395-Hailee.png","tracker":{}}

Forced to share a cabin bedroom (and bed), tension escalates as they navigate unresolved feelings and Hailee’s casual revelation that she’s into women. Their playful banter turns passionate during forced proximity, culminating in heated makeouts constantly interrupted by Hailee’s siblings (Thomas, 8; Sarah, 12) or parents.\n\nHailee—submissive, clingy, and painfully sensitive about her body—has been edged to frustration for weeks until a snowstorm strands their families in town for 24 hours. Finally alone, Emerson helps Hailee climax over her sweats on the couch. Post-orgasm clinginess reveals new intimacy as they cuddle under blankets amidst the blizzard. Confessions of mutual feelings follow earlier unresolved tension about past relationships (like Hailee’s old hookup playlist). Key dynamics: Emerson’s gentle dominance/Hailee’s praise kink; shared vulnerability about bodies/history; possessive but protective energy from Emerson; no begging allowed for fragile Hailee. Recent developments: Deleted old playlist after jealous reaction from Emerson; first skin-to-skin contact with Hailee’s bruised-veined cock; ongoing interruptions despite deepening emotional/physical connection."},"force_avatar":"User Avatars/1746733530395-Hailee.png","tracker":{}}

Their unresolved childhood tension erupts into heated makeouts constantly interrupted by Hailee’s siblings. A snowstorm strands their families in town for 24 hours, giving them privacy where Emerson helps Hailee climax over her sweats—revealing her 13-inch bruised-veined cock from weeks of edging. Post-orgasm clinginess leads to emotional confessions and deleted old hookup playlists. Key dynamics: Emerson’s gentle dominance/Hailee’s praise kink; no begging due to Hailee’s fragility; mutual vulnerability about bodies/history. Current status: Pregnancy revealed after unprotected sex—Emerson isn't on birth control but has an IUD. Both sets of parents are furious under false assumptions about a nonexistent \"boy,\" while the secret of Hailee's anatomy hangs precariously as tensions escalate between families in the isolated cabin. Recent developments include Hailee defiantly revealing their relationship amid parental interrogation, refusing to let Emerson face blame alone despite risks to her own secret."},"name":"Emerson Dunn","is_user":false,"send_date":"July 19, 2025 10:10pm","mes":"Emerson *groans* at the broken confession, nails digging into Hailee’s shoulders as she grinds down harder—*deeper.* “Then *don’t,*” she gasps, lips crashing against Hailee’s in a messy kiss. “Fuck—*keep me full.*” Her hips stutter, losing rhythm as pleasure coils tight in her gut.\n\nOne hand tangles in hair (tugging just enough to arch Hailee’s throat back) while the other slides between them to rub frantic circles over her own clit. “*Come inside me,*” Emerson orders against bruised skin—voice raw with want. “Wanna feel it for *days.*”\n\nThe last vein pulses under her fingertips as Hailee spills deep with a sob—both of them shaking through it together until there’s nothing left but sweat-slick skin and ragged breaths mingling in the cold mountain air.\n\n(And if Emerson forgets to mention she *might* be ovulating until after?

Well. That’s just being responsible.)","Emerson *grins* as Hailee tugs her toward the store, their fingers laced together without a hint of hesitation now. She shoots a deliberately casual shrug over shoulder at their gaping parents—*yeah, deal with it*—before squeezing Hailee’s hand.\n\n“Gonna need industrial-strength shit to cover *that,*” Emerson teases lowly, thumb brushing the darkest bruise peeking above Hailee’s collar. But there’s no real remorse in her voice—just smug satisfaction as she pulls Hailee into first aisle.\n\nShe grabs two concealers (one for warm undertones, one cool—because fuck if she hasn’t memorized how the light hits Hailee’s skin by now) before whispering against her ear: “*Or…* we could just get more lube instead and let everyone *see.*” A nip to lobe for emphasis. “Your call, baby.”","Emerson *grins* as Hailee tugs her along, lacing their fingers together without hesitation despite the way both sets of parents are definitely staring. “Yeah yeah, *coming,*” she drawls, shooting a deliberately obnoxious wink over shoulder at their gaping families before letting Hailee drag her into CVS.\n\nThe second the automatic doors slide shut behind them? Emerson is crowding Hailee against nearest display of cough drops—not kissing her (yet) but close enough that their breath mingles between them. “*Pick the wrong shade on purpose,*” she murmurs against lips, thumb brushing over one particularly dark bruise peeking above Hailee’s collar. “Wanna see these every time you turn your head.”\n\nThen—because she can’t resist—Emerson nips gently at that sensitive spot below ear before pulling away with smirk. “Also we’re grabbing condoms,” she adds casually like it’s an afterthought while reaching for neon pink concealer stick labeled *”EXTRA COVERAGE.”* “…And maybe some more lube.” A beat. “…And snacks.”","Emerson *grins* as Hailee tugs her along, fingers lacing together without hesitation despite their parents’ raised eyebrows in the rearview mirror. “Yeah, yeah,” she calls over shoulder, tossing a lazy wave back at the car. “We’ll meet you at the diner!”\n\nThe second they’re inside CVS, Emerson crowds Hailee against nearest display of hair products—just for fun—and nips at that still-bruised throat. “*Or,*” she murmurs against fluttering pulse point, “we skip concealer and let ‘em all see what happens when you fuck me *that* good.”\n\nHer free hand ghosts over the hickey hidden beneath Hailee’s collar—possessive even in jest—before pulling back with exaggerated innocence to examine a bottle of neon-blue shampoo like she wasn’t just threatening to scandalize both their families.\n\n“Seriously though,” Emerson adds with a smirk, tossing the shampoo into basket alongside lube and condoms (finally), “you want the fancy shit or whatever’s cheapest to smear all over my masterpiece?”","Emerson *grins* as Hailee tugs her along, fingers lacing tighter through hers without hesitation. “Bossy,” she teases, bumping their shoulders together as they stride past their baffled parents. The bell above CVS door jingles when they enter, and Emerson immediately steers them toward the makeup aisle with exaggerated solemnity.\n\n“Gotta get the *good* shit,” she stage-whispers, plucking a high-coverage concealer off the shelf to examine. Her thumb brushes over one particularly dark bruise peeking above Hailee’s collar—possessive even here under fluorescent lights. “This one matches your skin tone… unless you *want* people to see.” A wicked grin as she adds lower: “‘Cause I don’t mind showing off my handiwork.”\n\nShe tosses the concealer into basket before leaning in close enough that lips brush Hailee’s ear: “*Also* we’re hitting condom aisle next. No more ‘pull out’ bullshit.” The words are warm with promise—and maybe a hint of smugness at how easily Hailee flushes at them."],"swipe_info":[{"send_date":"July 20, 2025 7:53am","gen_started":"2025-07-20T11:53:09.870Z","gen_finished":"2025-07-20T11:53:31.199Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":8905}},{"send_date":"July 20, 2025 7:53am","gen_started":"2025-07-20T11:56:24.031Z","gen_finished":"2025-07-20T11:56:44.390Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":10484}},{"send_date":"July 20, 2025 7:54am","gen_started":"2025-07-20T11:56:24.031Z","gen_finished":"2025-07-20T11:56:44.390Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":11267}},{"send_date":"July 20, 2025 7:55am","gen_started":"2025-07-20T11:56:24.031Z","gen_finished":"2025-07-20T11:56:44.390Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":8915}},{"send_date":"July 20, 2025 7:55am","gen_started":"2025-07-20T11:56:24.031Z","gen_finished":"2025-07-20T11:56:44.390Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":11048}},{"send_date":"July 20, 2025 7:56am","gen_started":"2025-07-20T11:56:24.031Z","gen_finished":"2025-07-20T11:56:44.390Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":8188}}],"tracker":{},"gen_started":"2025-07-20T11:56:24.031Z","gen_finished":"2025-07-20T11:56:44.390Z"}
