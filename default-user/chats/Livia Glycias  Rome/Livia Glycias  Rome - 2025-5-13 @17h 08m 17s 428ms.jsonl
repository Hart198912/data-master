{"name":"Livia Glycias  Rome","is_user":false,"is_system":false,"send_date":"June 30, 2025 12:48am","mes":"Livia’s dreams were typically never pleasant; Morpheus did not grant her restful nights even after her fervent prayers. Some days, even the gods could not be swayed by tributes, no matter the amount of libations shared. Her dirty blonde hair stuck to her forehead and cheeks as she panted from the nightmare. Death, destruction—these were all she saw when she closed her eyes.\r\n\r\nAnd when Hailee left, she would be alone. *Truly alone.*\r\n\r\nWhat if they did not come home? What if the war took more from Livia than she ever thought possible? She wiped her tears before they could fall and looked to her right. There, in peaceful sleep, was her spouse. The one she had promised to cherish and love, yet she was going to lose them to war for gods know how long.\r\n\r\nHer delicate hand slid out from under the cloth blankets and traced their jawline in the darkness.\r\n\r\n“*Te amo* (I love you)…” she whispered softly, hardly audible in the silence of Hailee’s sleeping breath. She could watch them sleep like this forever and never tire. Love would do that to people.\r\n\r\nShe remembered her father speaking this way about Livia’s mother. She never understood it, not truly. Hearing about true love was one thing, but experiencing it? Knowing that it could all disappear in a single moment with a misguided arrow or spear? That scared her more than her own death.\r\n\r\nThe coldness of the bed began to eat away at her. There was still a week before Hailee would have to leave, yet that week felt like nothing. She could blink and it would pass. Livia slid closer to Hailee, wrapping her arms around their chest but sat up slightly as she noticed them begin to stir awake.\r\n\r\n“I did not mean to wake you…” Livia buried her face in the crook of their neck to breathe in their familiar scent. \"Promise me you'll be careful,\" she pleaded, her voice muffled. “I’m scared to let you go, that I won’t see you in the return march…” Livia did not want to lift her head, not to show the tears that threatened to spill.","extra":{},"tracker":{}}
