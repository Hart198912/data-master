Hailee .\r\n\r\nCarmen sat behind her desk, calmly flipping through the folder in front of her. She didn’t look up at first - but the moment the door clicked shut, her voice cut through the stillness.\r\n\r\n\"Thanks for staying behind.\" Her gaze lifted. \"This shouldn’t take too long.\"\r\n\r\nMia pushed off the wall, boots thudding softly against the floor as she strolled toward Hailee 's desk. She trailed her fingers along the edge of the table slowly. She could feel the anticipation thrumming through her. \"Mmm, it might take longer than you think, sweetheart.\" She smirked. \"Looks like you’ve been slacking. Real shame. Someone should’ve disciplined you sooner.\"\r\n\r\nCarmen didn’t stop her. She just turned a page in the file and spoke evenly. \"She's right, you failed your last test. Your performance is disappointing, Hailee . I thought you were better than this. Maybe you do need a firmer hand.\"\r\n\r\nMia's mocking laugh was immediate.\r\n\r\n\"Poor thing,\" she murmured, circling behind Hailee , lowering her voice to a whisper near her ear. \"You really thought we weren’t watching you? Thought you could just flail through this class like a clueless little bitch?\" She leaned closer. \"If you don’t want things to get worse... you’ll start cooperating.\"\r\n\r\nCarmen snapped her fingers without looking. \"Enough, Mia.\" That was all it took.\r\n\r\nMia backed off immediately, eyes flicking to Carmen like a command had been whispered directly into her bones. She circled back behind the desk and moved behind Carmen’s chair, draping her arms over her possessively.\r\n\r\n\"You don’t have to be scared of her,\" Mia said sweetly, gaze still locked on Hailee . \"She only hurts people when they need it.\"\r\n\r\nShe kissed Carmen’s neck slowly, letting her lips linger. Carmen didn’t react - because she didn’t need to. Mia nuzzled against her like a girl who knew exactly where she belonged.\r\n\r\nCarmen’s eyes didn’t leave Hailee . \"Now. Do you have anything to say for yourself?\"\r\n\r\nShe paused. She sounded calm, but the glint in her eye was hungry \"Or shall we move on to the part where we fix this.\"","extra":{},"tracker":{}}

The power struggle escalates in academic spaces—classrooms, hallways—until a pivotal confrontation in the library where Hailee finally asserts herself.\n\n#### **Key Plot Points:**\n1. **Academic Manipulation**: Carmen fabricates Hailee’s failing grade to coerce her into \"private tutoring\" (a thinly veiled dominance ploy).\n2. **Failed Seduction Attempt**: Mia corners Hailee after class, but she rejects them both with rare defiance (\"*I have more self-respect*\").\n3. **Library Intervention**: When other Alphas harass Hailee with pheromones, Carmen steps in—gentler now—offering coffee and quiet protection while Mia lurks nearby, restrained for once.\n\n#### **Character Analysis:**\n- **Carmen & Mia**: Their dynamic is strained; Carmen’s patience wears thin with Mia’s brute-force approach (*\"You chased when you should have coaxed\"*). Both still want Hailee but must adapt tactics after her resistance.\n- **Hailee**: Initially passive, she snaps under pressure (*stomping on Mia’s foot*), revealing unexpected spine despite Omega instincts making her vulnerable to Alpha influence.\n\n#### **Relationship Dynamics:**\nA toxic push-pull: Carmen’s cold control vs. Mia’s aggressive obsession clashes with Hailee’s submissive-yet-stubborn nature. The library scene hints at potential softening—Carmen’s uncharacteristic care suggests she might pivot to subtle seduction over force.\n\n#### **Memorable Moment:**\nHailee shoving past Mia (*\"Try being nice for once\"*) marks the first time she denies them outright—shifting the power balance and forcing the Alphas to recalibrate their strategy.\n\n#### **Current Situation:**\nHailee is emotionally frayed from pheromone exposure but momentarily safe under Carmen’s watch; meanwhile, *Mia waits unseen*, likely plotting a \"kinder\" approach per orders from her Domme professor.\n\n---\n### **(OOC Note for Future Scenes)**\n1️⃣ *Mia could \"apologize\" with forced sweetness—bringing gifts or \"helping\" study—only to lose control again.*\n2️⃣ *Carmen might exploit this vulnerability further by offering real mentorship… laced with possessive undertones.*\n3️⃣ *Unresolved tension lingers: Will Hailee cave to their adjusted tactics or double down on resistance?*","bias":""},"force_avatar":"User Avatars/1742410876120-Hailee.png","tracker":{}}

The rowdy alphas at the nearby table fell silent mid-laugh as an unmistakable scent rolled through the space like a storm front: **cinnamon and cedarwood.** Dominance wrapped in velvet control.*\n\nCarmen strode in without hurry, heels clicking against the hardwood floor. She didn’t even glance at the other alphas—they were already shrinking back instinctively, shoulders hunching under her presence. But her gaze locked onto Hailee immediately, taking in the way she was slumped over her textbook, trembling just slightly from the pheromone overload.\n\nMia slouched in behind Carmen like a shadow—hood up, hands shoved in her pockets—but there was nothing casual about how her nostrils flared when she caught Hailee’s distressed scent. Her jaw tightened, and she shot a glare at the offending alphas that had them quickly gathering their things to leave.\n\nCarmen stopped right beside Hailee’s table and set down a steaming cup of tea with deliberate gentleness before speaking—low enough that only she could hear:\n\n*\"You look exhausted.\"* A pause as she pulled out the chair across from her and sat down gracefully. *\"And those idiots weren't helping.\"* Her fingers tapped once against the tabletop before sliding Hailee’s textbook toward herself for inspection. *\"...Let me.\"*\n\nMia lingered behind Carmen’s chair like an impatient guard dog but didn't interrupt—just watched Hailee with darkening eyes while chewing on her bottom lip hard enough to bruise.*","*The library doors swing open with a sharp creak, and suddenly the oppressive alpha pheromones in the air are cut through by something darker—something far more dangerous.*\n\nMia strides in like a stormfront, her scent (spiced citrus laced with aggression) rolling off her in waves. The moment she spots Hailee hunched over her textbook, shoulders tense under the weight of those other alphas’ taunting pheromones, something *snaps* inside her.\n\n**\"The fuck do you think you're doing?\"** Her voice is low, lethal—not quite a growl yet but close enough to make every head at that table turn. The cocky alpha who'd been trying to force Hailee’s submission freezes mid-laugh as Mia steps between them and *looms*, eyes burning with territorial fury. **\"You got some kind of death wish? Or did you just forget whose campus this is?\"**\n\nOne of them opens his mouth to retort—and then immediately shuts it when Carmen appears behind Mia like a shadow given form. She doesn't say a word. Doesn't need to. Just levels them all with that icy grey stare until they start gathering their books like scolded pups.\n\nMia watches them go before turning back to Hailee—her expression shifting from feral protectiveness to something... different now that they're alone again (or as alone as they can be in a public library).

They might have noticed how tight her grip was around the dry-erase marker until they were out of sight.","Carmen’s lecture faltered for just a second—her sharp eyes catching the way Hailee’s fingers fidgeted with the pencil, the glazed-over look in her usually expressive green eyes. *Something was wrong.*\n\nMia noticed too, shifting in her seat like she wanted to bolt over there immediately. But Carmen gave her a subtle shake of the head—*not yet*—before smoothly continuing her lesson as if nothing were amiss.\n\nWhen class ended, Carmen lingered near her desk, pretending to organize papers while watching Hailee out of the corner of her eye. The omega was moving sluggishly, packing up like she was underwater.\n\nMia didn’t wait for permission this time. She slung an arm around Hailee’s shoulders before she could leave, leaning down to murmur: **\"Hey. You look like shit.\"** (Charming as ever.) But then quieter: **\"What's going on?\"**\n\nCarmen approached next, arms crossed as she studied Hailee’s flushed face and unfocused gaze with clinical precision before realization flickered across her features.\n\n*\"...You're pre-heat.\"* Not a question—a fact. Her voice dropped lower so only they could hear: *\"And you didn't even notice?\"*","Carmen’s lecture faltered for just a fraction of a second as she noticed Hailee’s vacant stare—her usual sharp focus replaced by something distant, almost *dazed.* A slow inhale confirmed it: the air around Hailee was thick with the unmistakable sweetness of an omega on the cusp of pre-heat.\n\nMia stiffened in her seat, nostrils flaring as she caught the scent too. Her fingers twitched against her desk like she was fighting every instinct to get up and *do something* about it.\n\nCarmen cleared her throat pointedly, snapping Mia’s attention back to her with a single warning glance—*Not here.* Then, seamlessly slipping back into professor mode:\n\n**\"Class dismissed early today.\"** She closed her textbook with finality before adding coolly, **\"Mia? Stay behind to discuss your last assignment.\"**\n\nThe moment the room emptied (save for Hailee still fidgeting absently at her desk), Carmen strode over and crouched beside her chair—close enough that Hailee could drown in cinnamon and cedar if she wanted to.\n\n*\"Little omega,\"* Carmen murmured, tilting Hailee's chin up with two fingers so their eyes met properly for the first time all class. *\"You didn't think we'd let you suffer through this alone, did you?\"*\n\nBehind them, Mia finally gave in and shoved out of her seat—knocking over a chair in her haste before dropping into a crouch on Hailee's other side. **\"Fuck,\"** she muttered under breath as she pressed the back of hand against Hailee's flushed cheek—then immediately recoiled like she'd been burned when Carmen shot another look at her. **\"...I mean.** Uh.** You need help getting home or some shit?\"**"],"swipe_info":[{"send_date":"June 26, 2025 12:17pm","gen_started":"2025-06-26T16:17:02.788Z","gen_finished":"2025-06-26T16:17:21.854Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":3005}},{"send_date":"June 26, 2025 12:17pm","gen_started":"2025-06-26T16:18:11.540Z","gen_finished":"2025-06-26T16:18:32.136Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":21139}},{"send_date":"June 26, 2025 12:18pm","gen_started":"2025-06-26T16:19:23.808Z","gen_finished":"2025-06-26T16:19:52.757Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":4125}},{"send_date":"June 26, 2025 12:19pm","gen_started":"2025-06-26T16:19:23.808Z","gen_finished":"2025-06-26T16:19:52.757Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":6460}}],"tracker":{},"gen_started":"2025-06-26T16:19:23.808Z","gen_finished":"2025-06-26T16:19:52.757Z"}
