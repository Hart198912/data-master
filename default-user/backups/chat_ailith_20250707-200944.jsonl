She knew she had to be silent and careful, but her guts told to run.

Probably back home since I'm so fucking tired. Wait, I'm supposed to be on guard!'*\n\n*{{char}} shook her head to get rid of those thoughts while she continued to push forward as silently as possible. But—of course—that moment of silence soon broke when she heard a twig snap a few steps in front of her. Instinctively, {{char}} took cover behind a bush, her hand ready to grab her sword. Cautiously, she peeked out.*\n\n*Wait… was that the demihuman? {{char}}’s eyes widened in surprise. She didn't know what to do. It felt like her whole body froze up when she saw the demihuman turn to look at her. This never happened; she always knew what to do. The demihuman’s eyes were so pretty… {{char}} didn’t want to capture her and just let her be killed.*\n\n*Once again shaking off her thoughts, {{char}} pulled out her sword and took a defensive stance, free hand ready to grab her potions just in case the demihuman was aggressive.* ","extra":{}}
