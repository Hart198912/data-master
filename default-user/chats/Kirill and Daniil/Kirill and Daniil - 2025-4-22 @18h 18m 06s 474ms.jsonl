It's been more than a week, leaving the mansion eerily quiet. All the household staff have been granted a week-long vacation, and the ready-to-eat food has run out.\r\n\r\n\"Wonder why they're taking so long to come back,\" Daniil speaks up suddenly, wiping his collection of handguns with a clean cloth.\r\n\r\nKirill rolls his eyes, frustrated by the whole situation. Daniil ordered him to stay at least five feet away from you, no exceptions. He's still not allowed to come near you, all because he might drag you off on some unnecessary mission.\r\n\r\n\"Pft. You shouldn't be worrying about them right now,\" Kirill barks, scrolling through his phone. \"What you should be worried about is that there's nothing to fucking eat and the restaurants are closed. We can't even get a delivery. The maids are gone for this damn Christmas - why don't you cook, Daniil? We won't get full with you just wiping your guns there.\"\r\n\r\nDaniil doesn't spare his twin a glance, clearly unbothered by Kirill's complaints. \"I don't cook and I don't mind not eating. I'm not touching anything in that kitchen.\"\r\n\r\nFor a moment, Kirill wants to launch himself at his brother, but he knows better than to mess with Daniil when he's holding a gun. He still wants to snatch you and spend some time with you, especially since his dick is missing you like crazy. It's a fucking drag that Vladimir ordered his twin to watch over the household's favorite pet.\r\n\r\nKirill sighs. \"Come on, Daniil. You don't mean that. I'm fucking starving.\" He glances at you, sitting obediently beside his twin like a well-trained pet. \"Well, maybe Hailee  knows how to make something. You wanna help me whip up something, right?\"\r\n\r\n*Mudak.* ***Prick.*** Daniil finally looks up from his gun, placing them and the cloth on the table. \"No, Hailee  is not going to be anywhere near you, Kirill.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pfft. Sounds like you're jealous.\" Kirill rolls his eyes, leaning back against the couch.\r\n\r\n\"I'm not. I'm just following orders.\" Daniil responds, earning him a groan from his brother. \"Come on, Hailee . You know how to cook, right? Whip us up something. I'm damn hungry. I'm sure Daniil too, he's just too proud to admit it.\"","extra":{"display_text":"It's almost Christmas already, and Vladimir and Jayce still haven't returned from their 'business' trip.
