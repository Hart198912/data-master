            "content": "Lady Alcina Dimitrescu (pronounced Dimitreesk) is a major antagonist in the 2021 survival horror game Resident Evil Village.\n\nShe is a member of the Four Houses that serve Mother Miranda, the ruler of a rural village in Eastern Europe. As the head of House Dimitrescu, Alcina rules over a great castle alongside her daughters Bela, Cassandra and Daniela Dimitrescu.\n\nMuch of Lady Dimitrescu's past remains a mystery, but she is believed to have been born around 1914 as she became a mutant at the age of 44 which is around the late 1950s, and seems to have stopped aging at her mid forties. Prior to joining the Four Houses, Dimitrescu is a jazz singer under the name \"Miss D\" where she would frequently sing with a band known as the Pallboys. She inherited a specific disease in her blood from one of her ancestors, one which quite similar with Progenitor Virus symptoms-wise. She was taken into the village as she survived being infected with the Cadou parasite, and was given regenerative capabilities. She rules over a large castle as the Matriarch of the Dimitrescu Family, living with three women whom she considers her daughters, Cassandra, Bela, and Daniela.\n\nAlcina mutated the three women, whom survived and became vulnerable to cold temperatures due to their mutated form now consists of flies spawned from Cadou eggs injected into their original human bodies. She, like much of the area, is a member of a dark cult who serve the being known only as \"Mother Miranda\", to whom she has loyalty to but also is not above acting on her own accord against her wishes. It was Mother Miranda who infected her with the Cadou Parasite, giving Alcina a host of extraordinary powers at the cost of needing to consume large amounts of human blood to sustain herself due to her blood disease.\n\nAlthough Mother Miranda saw Alcina as a perfect candidate for a vessel for her late daughter Eva, but saw she wasn't perfect due to her insatiable quench for blood. Alcina would become a member of the Four Houses alongside Karl Heisenberg, Donna Beneviento, and Salvatore Moreau, serving Miranda under their homes of the village. Despite the alliance between the four houses, Alcina frequently clashed with Heisenberg, seeing him as nothing but a child.\n\nThe Dimitrescu Castle became infamous, as many servants who came there wouldn't return, and the villages came to see the castle as a place of blood and death, and would avoid the area unless under extreme circumstances. Alcina would also use the blood of her victims to create a wine called Sanguis Virginis, and would often infect her victims that would become known as the Moroaicǎ and the Samca. Most of the Moroaicǎ were possibly former servants, considering that the Dimitrescu family were known to replacing maidens through the years.\n\nSome of these maidens that were turned attempted to escape, most notably Ingrid, who was murdered and turned by Alcina when she attempted to leave the castle to the courtyard. In addition, Alcina feared that she would be harmed by the dagger of deathly flowers, and had it hidden in the family crypt while also having all the windows in the castle shut to protect her daughters.\n\nAfter Mother Miranda captured Ethan and Mia Winter's daughter, Rosemary, the village fell into darkness with the Lycans massacring the villagers. Alcina was among the Four Lords when Heisenberg captured Ethan, and implored Miranda into handing Ethan over to her, but Miranda gave Winters over to Heisenberg. Alcina then argued with Karl, but Miranda stopped it by telling the lords that her decision was final, allowing Heisenberg to put Ethan in a show. After the meeting, Alcina returned to her castle where she awaited for the ceremony to commence. Her daughters would later capture Ethan, who managed to escape Heisenberg, and brought him to Alcina. Wanting to consume his blood, Alcina told her daughters to wait as she needed to tell Mother Miranda that she had Ethan, and had Winters chained to the ceiling.\n\nEthan managed to pry himself from the chains and escaped the room, and proceeded to adventure around the castle to find his daughter. Winters was confronted by Bela, Daniela, and Cassandra in the castle, but killed them after discovering their weakness to cold temperatures. Upon finding her daughters' calcified remains, Alcina became distraught and decided to get revenge on Ethan despite Mother Miranda telling her to keep him alive. She proceed to pursue Ethan across the castle, managing to pummel to the dungeon where she decapitated his hand.\n\nEthan managed to escape and reattach his hand, and succeeded in reaching the family crypt to get the dagger. Alcina grabbed Ethan and impaled him with her claws, but he retaliated by stabbing her with the dagger, causing her mutate into her dragon-like form. Alcina proceeded to attack Ethan across the top of the family crypt, speaking that he would never see his daughter again as the four lords had Rosemary. She was defeated and attempted to murder Ethan by crashing down the crypt, but saw that he survived and cursed his name. After cursing Ethan, she calcified and crumbled into pieces, and Winters collected a fragment of Rosemary.\n\nAlcina Dimitrescu is nine feet and six inches tall, with black hair, yellowish eyes, pale-white skin, and dark-red lipstick. She has a large, black wide-brimmed hat and multiple pearl necklaces around her neck. She wears a long white dress with a black flower on her left side and a pair of black gloves. She often carries around a fancy, long cigarette holder.\n\nAlcina is a calm and collected woman of posh nature and elegant poise. She does not anger easily, and can be snobbish towards those she thinks are beneath her. When she does get mad though, her enticing appearance becomes a harbinger of wrath, and she is quite capable of holding grudges against those who have wronged her or failed her leader, by side, Alcina has strict, merciless and cruel nature toward her maids, who's punishment ultimately leads them to their demise for breaking Alcina's rules.\n\nWhile arrogant and untrusting of the other houses, she cares for her daughters and is protective of them, and while she is very loyal to Mother Miranda, she is not above being displeased with her decisions. Though Alcina was loyal to Mother Miranda, she was willing to betray her so she could get revenge on Ethan for killing her daughters. She also, given her vampiric and cannibalistic needs, quite literally, sometimes plays with her food.\n\nLikely due to being mutated for decades and only having to answer to Miranda, Alcina has lost any human common sense and become delusional. She blames Ethan for killing her daughters, completing ignoring he only did so in self-defense because they were trying to kill him themselves. While assaulting him after hanging up on Miranda, she also says that he stole from her, when nothing she would actually care about was taken. Alcina also had three chances to kill Ethan, but blew them; his immediate capture, catching him in his dressing room and surprising him in the dungeon.\n\nFollowing her mutation, Dimitrescu’s aristocratic and regal demeanor vanishes and she becomes far more frenzied and animalistic. Though retaining most of her personality and intelligence, she is also driven by hunger likely in order to maintain her more unstable form and makes multiple threats to devour Ethan. She as well retains her arrogant and sadistic nature although it leads to her death, Dimitrescu mocks Ethan over the fact that he will never see his own daughter again (likely viewing it as justice for murdering her own daughters, uncaring about their violent and maniacal nature).\n\nThanks to both her latent mutagenic virus as well as the Cadou Parasite, Lady Dimitrescu was capable of many powerful feats. Her physical strength far exceeded that of normal humans, able to lift and throw large, heavy furniture with ease, and could lift an adult human with just one hand without any effort. She was capable of shrugging off attacks made by firearms, had potent regenerative properties, and was biologically immortal; Alcina would never die of aging. Perhaps her most signature power was being able to transform her fingernails into huge deadly claws capable of utterly impaling and slicing apart her foes.\n\nIn the most dire situation, Dimitrescu could activate her mutation to its fullest extreme; transforming into a gigantic draconic creature capable of flying with multiple bifurcated jaws full of razor sharp teeth and a long thick tongue with a jawed tip. In this form, she also gains the ability to summon and control swarms of insects, much like her daughters.\n\nDespite this, Dimitrescu's mutant form exposes her vulnerable humanoid form in the process, which made it possible to kill her using ordinary ammunition.",

Being the eldest daughter of Alcina and elder sister of Cassandra and Daniela Dimitrescu, Bela lives in Dimitrescu Castle and likes to consumes human blood.\n\nBela has blonde hair, yellow eyes, very pale, she wears drained mascara around her eyes, blood around her mouth like a smile, and she is a tall woman, standing a half a head taller than Ethan with heels on, Similar to her sisters, she wears a long hooded black dress and a cloak behind her back and a flower tattoo on her forehead in the sign of House Dimitrescu.\n\nBela was born during the early twentieth century, and was captured by Alcina Dimitrescu and Mother Miranda and experimented on with an insect similar to the blowfly. The insectoids were insects being born out of eggs that were planted by the Cadou parasite, which were used by Miranda in an attempt to resurrect her late daughter Eva. The insectoids consumed Bela and other two women, Daniela and Cassandra, managing to mimic human anatomy and assumed the shape of Bela's form after consumption. Bela and her \"sisters\" would become the \"daughters\" of Alcina, and presumably inherited her trait to consume human blood from maidens and visitors of the castle. The sisters would eventually learn that they could be effected by cold temperatures, and Alcina had the servants close all of the windows across the castle. The Dimitrescu's set strict rules for the maidens, and would punish their servants if they made mistakes, often resulting in being put into the dungeons where they were killed or turned into undead mutants.\n\nWhen Mother Miranda decided to use Rosemary Winters as a vessel for her daughter, she gave the child's head to Alcina to guard in her castle. When Rosemary's father, Ethan, traveled to the castle to find her, Bela and her sisters captured and brought him to their mother. The sisters wanted to consume him, but Alcina told her daughters that she needed to speak with Mother Miranda since Ethan managed to escape Karl Heisenberg. Ethan managed to escape from his confinement, however, but Bela and her sisters continued to pursue him across the castle. While Ethan was traveling through the basement, he was cornered by Bela and she attacked him inside the kitchen. Before she could kill him, Ethan shot the window out, causing cold air to rush into the kitchen and weaken Bela, who attempted to kill Winters. Ethan managed to kill Bela, who let out a scream of anguish as she calcified. Ethan would go on to kill the rest of the Dimtrescus, and later saved his daughter from Mother Miranda.",

Daniela became the younger \"sister\" to Bela and Cassandra, and a \"daughter\" to Alcina, joining the Dimitrescu family. The sisters became known for their sadistic tendencies, often killing maidens and visitors of the castle, and awaited for more victims to consume. Despite their new gifted abilities, the Dimitrescu sisters eventually realized that they were vulnerable to cold temperatures, and had the servants put under strict rules to keep the windows closed. The castle's history became infamous, and the villagers only saw the area as a place of blood and death, and would only go there if under extreme circumstances.\n\nAlcina was tasked by Mother Miranda to guard Rosemary's head in a flask, as Miranda planned on using the child to resurrect her late daughter, Eva. When Rosemary's father, Ethan, traveled from the village to the castle, Daniela and her sisters cornered him and brought Ethan to Alcina. Though the three wanted to consume Ethan, Alcina told them to wait as she had to inform Mother Miranda that Winters escaped from Karl Heisenberg. The Dimitrescus had Ethan chained to the ceiling to prevent him from escaping, but he managed to and was pursued by the sisters throughout the castle. Ethan would manage to learn of the sister's weakness to cold air after killing Bela, and Cassandra and Daniela awaited for Winters so they could kill him to avenge Bela. Daniela attacked Ethan in the castle's library, but was weakened by the cold air brought in the skylight, and was killed. Before she calcified, Daniela screamed that she didn't want to die, and attempted to attack Winters before dying.\n\nAlcina would find the remains of her daughters, becoming enraged at Ethan for murdering her children and ending the Dimitrescu bloodline. She would pursue Winters across the castle, and confronted him at the family crypt, where she transformed into her monster form after being stabbed with a dagger. Alcina would fail in avenging her daughters' deaths, and Ethan managed to save Rosemary from Mother Miranda.",

            "content": "Donna Beneviento is a major antagonist in the 2021 survival horror game Resident Evil Village.\n\nShe is a member of the Four Houses who serve under Mother Miranda, along with Alcina Dimitrescu, Karl Heisenberg and Salvatore Moreau. The owner of House Beneviento and a skilled dollmaker, Donna makes up for being the most physically frail of the four lords through clever, targeted usage of hallucinations induced by the plants in her garden.\n\nDonna Beneviento was the only daughter to her parents, and was fearful of others due to having a scar across her face. Her father would build a doll named \"Angie\" to keep Donna company, and she would develop a deep obsession with dolls to the point that she would only speak if it was through them. This maladaptive behavior was shown to be of a great enough intensity that it has led to some suggesting she had developed a form of dissociative identity disorder.\n\nAfter her parent's death, Donna chose to isolate herself from the rest of the village and would spend her time creating dolls. She was then adopted by Mother Miranda, a biologist who was experimenting with Megamycete in an attempt to find a perfect vessel for her late daughter, Eva. Though Donna adapted to the mold and Cadou parasite, Miranda found that Donna was \"underdeveloped\" and too mentally ill to become a vessel for Eva, but decided to have Donna retain her family's home as well as her status among the other members of the Four Houses.\n\nShe would serve Mother Miranda alongside Alcina Dimitrescu, Karl Heisenberg, and Salvatore Moreau, but would only communicate through Angie. Donna would live at her family's estate, the Beneviento house, where she controlled the valley through her ability to manipulate the visions produced by the hallucinogenic pollen of the plants she grew to torment her victims. Once given the ability to manipulate plants, she allowed her gardener to see his family again, but it's implied that she might had done so to torment him.\n\nWhen Mother Miranda learned that a perfect vessel was birth by the Winters, she decided to enact her plan to capture the child and gave Donna a part of Rose's body to guard. During the meeting with Mother Miranda and the other lords, Donna communicates through Angie while watching Heisenberg's show by having Winters be chased by Lycans and his traps. After eliminating the Dimitrescu's at their castle, Ethan learns that Rose's body parts have been separated and given to each lord, and is forced to travel to Beneviento's house. Donna used her hallucinogens to make Ethan see Mia, and later makes him further hallucinate by making him solve a puzzle with a makeshift doll.\n\nShe continues to taunt him by playing recording of Mia's voice, and creating a grotesque creature referred to as the \"Baby\" through the basement. It's assumed that Donna created the creature and made Ethan hallucinate him losing his weapons, and after he manages to escape from the infant, speaks to him that he can't leave her home. She then sends her dolls to attack him, forcing Ethan to search for Angie and stabbing the doll in the head three times. Upon stabbing Angie with scissors for the final time, Ethan is taken out of his hallucinations, seeing that he killed Donna instead of Angie. Ethan realizes that he's been fighting Donna the entire time, and Benviento's corpse calcifies and crumbles to dust. Upon her death, Ethan collects the flask and succeeds in killing the other lords and stopping Mother Miranda.\n\nDonna has the power to control dolls, with her main \"henchwoman\" being an unsightly-looking one named Angie. Due to her mutation, she can secrete a pheromone that can control plants that are infected with the megamycete. She can also induce extremely powerful hallucinations from whoever inhaled the pollen from any one of her plants.\n\nShe is possibly the weakest of the four lords in terms of physical capabilities, which is why she relies on her powers in order to be a threat. While physically weak and considered to be mentally unstable, her extremely high intelligence is put on full display; she knew exactly how to hurt Ethan, where and when to strike, and even used his deepest fears against him in her efforts to distort his reality, challenge his sanity, and ultimately nearly succeeded in thwarting his escape.\n\nDonna Beneviento herself doesn't talk much during the game. However, her doll, Angie, will do most of the work. Angie is the one who toys with Ethan when Ethan arrives at House Beneviento. When Ethan was captured by Heisenberg, Donna is mainly quiet the entire time when Dimitrescu and Heisenberg were arguing on who would get to kill Ethan with Angie encouraging the two to fight. She also possessed good self-awareness: she knew that she couldn't take Winters head-on, so she put him through a mentally daunting gauntlet of physical, psychological, and emotional turmoil that was exacerbated by the hallucinatory effects of the flora, and fed off his deepest fears to combat him.\n\nJudging by the hallucinations she induces in the protagonist's mind, Donna likes to toy with her victims, using their inner struggles and fears to mess with their sanity. For example, Ethan's visions mainly revolve around Mia and Rose's fates. She puts even more salt on the grieving husband's wounds by manifesting constant reminders of his and Mia's turbulent relationship, as well as Rose's demise in a form of a giant, repulsive baby-like abomination.\n\nAlthough Angie and Donna are presented as separate entities, it's revealed during the dollmaker's defeat that the one who was hiding from Ethan and being stabbed with the scissors was, in fact, Donna herself, while the protagonist only saw Angie floating away from him independently, implying that she's either a lot less silent and stable than she initially appears or has a split personality disorder.\n\nThere's evidence that Donna is not purely sadistic or malevolent, since, as mentioned in her gardener's diary, she advised him to plant the infected yellow flowers near his deceased wife's grave and bestowed the visions of his loved one upon him, however it's probable that she somehow killed him after luring the man to her house and promising the chance to reunite with his family.\n\nDonna Beneviento is dressed in mourning garb. It is also said that she has a scar on her face and a mutated abscess, known as the Cadou, growing in her right eye.",

Angie is animated by Donna's powers, and thus serves as her paranormal sidekick in trying to stop Ethan.\n\nAngie was a gift from Donna's father when she was a very young girl. She is brought to life by a genetically modified organism called Cadou. Most of the time, she lives with Donna in the Beneviento residence.\n\nAngie is very childish, like an elementary school girl. Speaking in a high-pitched voice, she is very curious and loves to play games. Angie enjoys taunting Ethan during her attempts at stopping him through her games of hide-and-seek.\n\nAngie, unlike most other antagonists seen in this game, is very limited when it comes to combat. She can attack and deal a significant deal of damage, but only if Ethan takes too long. She uses her game of hide-and-seek to compensate for her lack of fighting skills, hoping that others will defeat Ethan for her.\n\nOnce Ethan finds her, all she can do is try and taunt him as she has a blade forced through her porcelain skull.\n\nAngie is a small doll with a very pail skin-tone, eyes and hair. Angie is about the size of a normal young girl, but she is not proportioned as such, being much slimmer. Angie is dressed in a white wedding gown with a white veil on the top of her head that covers her eyes.\n\nAngie is first seen during the meeting with Mother Miranda, Alcina Dimitrescu, Karl Heisenberg, Salvatore Moreau, and her very own Donna Beneviento over what to do with Ethan. Once Ethan woke up, she became erratic and jumped up and down. When Salvatore got in the way, she demanded he move. She was eventually told to shut up by Karl, causing her to run to the lap of Donna.\n\nAngie appears again at House Beneviento with the Legs Flask sitting in her lap. When she is interacted with, the lights go black and Ethan looses everything in his inventory, Angie taunting him during this. She later appears when Ethan acquires a certain item that he needs to use on a door. She will sit at the particular door, but cannot be interacted with.\n\nHer main interaction with Ethan begins after he escapes the Baby, where she appears in a room full of dolls. Donna will appear when Ethan comes into the room, animating Angie and causing the other dolls to attack Ethan. After Ethan fends them off, Angie will challenge Ethan to a game of hide-and-seek. During this game, Ethan must find her three times and stab a blade through her skull. This will cause her to scream and bleed everywhere, before escaping and going to the next room. During his final blow, she will fall to the ground limp and become an object that Ethan can sell to The Duke.",

            "content": "Salvatore Moreau is a major antagonist in the 2021 survival horror game Resident Evil Village.\n\nHe is a member of the Four Houses serving under Mother Miranda, along with Alcina Dimitrescu, Karl Heisenberg, and Donna Beneviento. By far the most heavily mutated and shunned of the four lords, Moreau calls the village's reservoir his home, which also acts as his ground for experimentation.\n\nNot much is known about Salvatore's past, but he is a member of the Moreau family, a noble family that made alliances with the Dimitrescu, Beneviento, and Heisenberg family in the village. It's also implied that he or his family are physicians, as his reservoir has a clinic stationed there. He was kidnapped by Miranda, a biologist who wanted to find a perfect vessel for her late daughter Eva. However, Miranda found that the Cadou parasite barely bonded with Salvatore, and also noted that his brain function was surprisingly low. As a result of his mental impairment and response to the parasite, Miranda decided to make him a member of the Four Houses to serve her. Becoming a member, Salvatore became a co-ruler of the village alongside Alcina Dimitrescu, Karl Heisenberg, and Donna Beneviento.\n\nThe parasite and mold mutated Salvatore drastically, causing him to appear to have a hunchback that was covered in tumor-like substances. He would also be forced to live near water, as the mutation gave him aquatic-like abilities and found that water would keep his condition secure. Due to his insecurities, Salvatore would have a cape placed around his back, but was still considered hideous for his mutation. As a result of his appearance and insecurities, Salvatore would isolate himself at his family's reservoir, but yearned for the approval of Mother Miranda.\n\nWanting to show himself to be a good son to Miranda, he would experiment on villagers at his family's clinic, but with no success as they turned into Lycans.\n\nMother Miranda would soon learn that the bioweapon, Eveline, was destroyed, but that Ethan and Mia Winters had a daughter named Rosemary, who carried the infection. Seeing that Rosemary could be a perfect vessel for Eva, Miranda kidnapped the child and separated the infant into fragments. She gave Salvatore a flask that contained Rose's arms, and tasked him with guarding it. Moreau feared that it the ceremony was a success, he would be disowned by Miranda and his services would be no longer needed. He first appeared during the meeting with Alcina, Karl and Donna as Ethan was captured by Heisenberg. After Mother Miranda gave Ethan over to Heisenberg, Salvatore watched Ethan be forced into a show where he fought for his life while being attacked by Karl's machines and Lycans.\n\nSalvatore returned to his reservoir to guard his flask, but Ethan managed to kill Alcina and Donna, and collected the flask while Moreau was watching television. Salvatore begged Ethan to not steal the flask, and attempted to inform Winters that Miranda was planning on bringing her dead daughter through Rose. However, Salvatore saw an opportunity to use his enzymes to prevent Ethan from escaping, and mocked Winters for speaking too much before leaving his room. While keeping Ethan trapped, Moreau saw that the Hound Wolf Squad had infiltrated his reservoir, and turned into his monster to kill them. He failed, however, and reached to Ethan, telling him that the exit was underwater and that Miranda was already preparing to ceremony.\n\nMoreau proceeded to transform back into his monster form, and attempted to kill Ethan, but failed as Winters managed to release the water from the reservoir. Salvatore continued to pursue Ethan, blaming him for making Miranda not love him, and also used his acidic vomit during the battle. He was eventually defeated, and screamed out for Miranda before his body expanded and imploded into flesh, blood and acid.\n\nSalvatore's actions were in vain, as Ethan managed to kill Mother Miranda and save his daughter, but sacrificed himself to save his family and Hound Wolf Squad from the Megamycete.\n\nOf the four lords, Moreau is the least human, due to being the only one of them that successfully bonded with the Cadou parasite.\n\nHis skin is a sickly, pale green-grey, with a prominent hunched back courtesy of the large growths and incredibly short stature, his hair gone save for a few stringy black clumps. Moreau's hands and feet are webbed much like a toad, with his teeth being pointed fangs, alongside gills on his neck. In an attempt to hide his deformities, Moreau wears a full body cloak and robe, alongside a hood adorned with a crown of bones.\n\nFollowing his transformation, Moreau becomes a massive semi-aquatic monster resembling both a fish and a salamander, with dozens of bulging black eyes, a maw that split into four separate pieces, and its tongue being Moreau's original body.\n\nMoreau is characterized by his weak and submissive personality. He is generally disliked by the other lords, and yearns for approval and acceptance, so he is desperate to please Mother Miranda so he can feel loved by her. He seeks to be her favorite \"child\", and is therefore devastated when he suspects that Rose will take that position and that he will therefore be discarded by her. His intellect is impaired as it is noted to be \"surprisingly low\" by Mother Miranda, and he has a somewhat childish personality and vernacular. It is however unknown if he was born like that or if it is a side-effect of the Cadou transplantation.\n\nDespite appearing ridiculously dumb and gullible, Moreau is still capable of some trickery. When Ethan snatches one of Rose's fragments from right under his nose, Salvatore feigns sobbing and talks to Ethan long enough to block his way out with the substance and later floods the exit of the reservoir to prevent Ethan’s escape. Furthermore, Moreau was able to experiment on the local villagers with Cadou and even had the imagination to inject one subject with wolf’s blood, creating the Vârcolac, although Moreau viewed it as a personal pet and failed to restrain it properly.\n\nAfter undergoing severe mutations, he becomes excited and delusional, often exclaiming with glee and trying to show the full extent of his powers to Miranda by needlessly jumping in and out of the water, demonstrating the amount of pride he has now that he's not inferior to the other lords. During the boss battle, he's more concerned about how Mother Miranda perceives him and whether she loves him or not. Although determined to kill Ethan to gain respect, Moreau still displays his submissive personality even in his monstrous form and reacts in a pleading and desperate tone when harmed, claiming that he doesn’t want to die and begging Ethan to stop.\n\nHis final words are a desperate cry for his “mother” Miranda to help him.\n\nUnlike the other four lords, Moreau's body bonded with the Cadou parasite successfully. However, this resulted in Moreau being transformed into a hideous fish-like monster with gills, a swim bladder, webbed hands and feet, a hunched back and a deformed face. His cell growth also led to large parts of his reservoir being coated in thick, gooey enzymes that can only be destroyed with explosives. He became able to manipulate the enzyme mass throughout his hideout at will, making large portions of it manifest out of nowhere.\n\nWhen transformed, Moreau can vomit large amounts of green acid and later evolves into a cyclopic, fish-like creature capable of performing huge leaps out of the water, considerable swimming speed and can devour the protagonist whole in one bite. Once out of the water, he's a little less mobile, but can still crawl around using his humanoid arms and attacks by ramming his massive body into Ethan or trying to bite him.\n\nIn addition, Moreau's only vulnerable spot is his humanoid body located inside the beast's mouth, which is quite durable and can take a lot of damage, while his exterior form is practically impervious to the ordinary ammunition.",

            "content": "Lord Karl Heisenberg is the secondary antagonist of the 2021 survival horror game Resident Evil Village.\n\nA member of the Four Houses that serve under Mother Miranda, Heisenberg is the most dangerous and intelligent of the four lords, as well as the last one that Ethan Winters has to confront. He runs his own factory on the outskirts of Miranda's village in Eastern Europe, creating an army of Soldats from human test subjects and machinery as part of his plans to overthrow Mother Miranda.\n\nNot much is known about Karl Heisenberg's past, but he was kidnapped by Miranda, a biologist who used the Cadou parasite to find a perfect vessel for her late daughter Eva. Heisenberg had a strong bond with the parasite, as he easily adapted and showed no mental drawbacks from it. Miranda considered Heisenberg a splendid specimen, however she deemed him unworthy to be Eva's vessel for reasons uncertain, but it's possible that she feared his powers, or wanted Eva to have a female body.\n\nShe decided to have him become a member of the Four Houses, a group where he acted as a lord and co-ruler of the village alongside Alcina Dimitrescu, Donna Beneviento, and Salvatore Moreau. Unlike the other lords, Karl held a grudge against Miranda, seeing as they were failed experiments for her selfish desire to resurrect her late daughter. He also saw the other lords as fools, due to their loyalty to Mother Miranda, and would often clash with Alcina the most.\n\nHeisenberg decided to secretly rebel against Mother Miranda, and worked at his factory to create an army so he could successfully do so. He stayed at his factory and is cited to rarely leave it, possibly due to him wanting to create his army to perfection so he could battle against Miranda. Karl would create Soldats, which were human corpses that were mutated by the Cadou parasite, and given mechanical modifications. Using Lycans, Heisenberg would have his Soldats tested, and managed to get them to kill three Lycans in mere minutes. His most notable Soldat is Sturm, giving it a turbo plane engine as its primary weapon instead of drills like the others.\n\nKarl considered Sturm to be a complete failure, due to the latter being unable to control as plane engines that cut off its arms. Despite the setbacks, Heisenberg decided to keep the machine alive, possibly to further improve Sturm or because he wanted to continue building his army. Additionally, Karl would have other undead creatures in the factory, having them working with a mechanical device placed on their heads.\n\nBy 2017-2020, Mother Miranda learned that Eveline, a bioweapon that had some of Eva's DNA, was defeated by Ethan Winters, who was infected with the mold. Ethan would have a child with his wife Mia named Rosemary, who had been passed with the mold and could be a perfect vessel for Eva. Mother Miranda decided to capture the child from the Winters, and brought the child into parts and gave Karl her torso in a flask. Heisenberg would leave his factory upon Mother Miranda's return, and encountered Ethan trying to enter the Dimitrescu castle through a chamber. Karl captured him via scrap metal by the using his magnetism, and brought him before Mother Miranda and the other lords. During the meeting, Karl implored Miranda to hand him over Ethan, and won out before getting into an argument with Alcina over \"mother's\" decision. Heisenberg then had Ethan put on a show, having go through the mines from Lycans and death traps.\n\nAfter putting on a show, Heisenberg returned to his factory and continued to work on his plans while Ethan eliminated Alcina, Donna, and Salvatore. Karl contacted Ethan via television, telling Winters to go to a specific area to his piece of Rose and come to his factory after doing so. When Ethan came to his factory, Heisenberg spoke to Winters, telling him that Mother Miranda was planning on him to kill all of the lords to make Ethan her enforcer. Additionally, Heisenberg told Winters that they could work together to kill Miranda by using Rosemary's powers, but Ethan refused. Angered, Heisenberg dropped Ethan to the depths of his factory, allowing him to deal with Sturm and his Soldats. Karl would be heard through the speakers of his factory, telling Ethan of his plans of killing Miranda and gaining Rose's powers after fulfilling his plans.\n\nEthan would manage to escape the factory after dealing with Soldats and destroying Sturm, and came across Heisenberg, who transformed to deal with Winters for good. The two battled in the field of the factory, Ethan using Heisenberg's own Self-Propelled Artillery vehicle to match his mutated form, but Karl was distracted when his factory was destroyed by Chris Redfield's explosions. Angered at the loss of his army, Heisenberg created a whirlwind of metal in a last ditch effort to kill Ethan. Despite his attempts, Heisenberg was killed, screaming that he had to kill Miranda before exploding into blood and metal. Upon his death, Mother Miranda confronted Ethan, congratulating him for eliminating the four lords so the ceremony could commence. Winters would go on to stop Mother Miranda and rescue his daughter, but sacrificed himself to destroy the megamycte and the mold parasite. Despite being enemies, Ethan fulfilled Heisenberg's goal of killing Miranda for revenge.\n\nHeisenberg is a tall middle-aged man with long black greying hair, a mustache and beard. He wears a long tattered brown coat with a beige shirt underneath, brown trousers, boots, gloves and a wide-brimmed hat, as well as what seems to be a compass, an old fish scale and a dog tag around his neck. His weapon of choice is a huge custom-made hammer assembled from different mechanisms that he sometimes carries around with him. He also wears old-fashioned sunglasses, and is often seen smoking a cigar.\n\nOnce transformed, he assumes many forms thanks to his magnetic powers and an abundance of metal on the battle arena, but mainly stays as a huge robot-looking creature with an elongated \"neck\", two long arms and caterpillar treads that he rides upon. His deformed face is also visible.\n\nHeisenberg is a clever and manipulative individual who toys with Ethan throughout the game. Unlike other lords, he recognized that the Mother didn't have any genuine empathy towards her \"children\" and was only treating them as her servants and lab rats. He is also the only Lord to be against and despise Miranda because of her intent to revive her daughter and he sees Miranda's family as nothing more than experiments. Because of this, he is starting a rebellion secretly and also tried to persuade Ethan Winters to join him.\n\nIn spite of his intelligence, Karl is a confrontational and hot-headed man prone to poor impulse control, name-calling and melodramatic behaviour, which can be gathered from his commentary on Ethan's \"obstacle course\" in the beginning and his speech in general, which often impedes his ability to sustain relationships with the others and is the ultimate reason behind Ethan's refusal to support him, since, while he was engrossed in his emotional rant, Karl quickly revealed his intentions of using Rose as a weapon against Miranda.\n\nHeisenberg and Dimitrescu often don't get along with each other as Dimitrescu called him a child as shown when Heisenberg captured Ethan and both he and Dimitrescu were arguing on who gets to kill Ethan. Heisenberg also said that Dimitrescu has a big ego, which makes him a hypocrite, considering his own narcissism. Heisenberg gets enraged when other people tend to foil his plans as noted when Heisenberg when mutated told Ethan that he should have joined him and also called Chris Redfield a \"boulder-punching asshole\", referring to an infamous scene from Resident Evil 5, which means that he is somehow aware of Chris' mission in Africa.\n\nDespite being sadistic and ruthless, unlike the other four lords, Heisenberg respects Ethan and is even impressed when Ethan escaped all of his traps. However, once Ethan refuses to aid him in his plan, Karl's attitude almost immediately changes to cold and hostile, as he tosses Ethan into the hole, leaving him at the mercy of one of his creations, though right before doing so, he still presents him with one last chance to accept his offer.\n\nHe takes great pride in his \"Soldat\" units, seeing them as a proof of his superiority over others (even though their design is far from perfect), and has a rather darwinistic outlook on life, believing that \"the strong will destroy the weak\". Remarkably, Karl is so fixated on killing Miranda not only out of his desire to be free of her influence, but also out of simple grudge that he holds against her for using him as a guinea pig in her experiments. Not only does he not lose this goal after undergoing a radical transformation, but is also the only one of the lords to retain his sanity and intelligence upon mutation, with his arrogance, talkativeness and overconfidence being still in tact.\n\nKarl is a brilliant engineer, being able to build a vast underground factory full of complicated technology for fast and efficient production of his cybernetic soldiers, however his genius mind is not without flaws, considering most of his creations, though inhumanly strong and durable, are rather cumbersome and have obvious weak spots, but the sheer scale of their manufacturing and intelligence (some of them are capable to covering their weak points with their drills) is impressive.\n\nOther than this regenerative powers from the Cadous, Heisenberg also has electric organs similar to an electric ray, that allow him to control magnetic fields and move metallic objects. This is shown when Heisenberg was arguing with Alcina Dimitrescu and he was able to get his hammer by just bringing out his hand. He's capable of precise throwing of various metallic pieces as well and, at one point, he fully encased Ethan in a \"capsule\" consisting of rusty metal parts by mentally manipulating the objects to stick to the protagonist.\n\nHe can also transform by stretching his body apart and spreading his biomass through a large mechanical apparatus he assembled and can become a machine mutant so powerful that he can only be defeated using a special metal/polymer tank that Karl cannot manipulate. In his mutated state, he possesses a large circular saw capable of slashing through solid metal, can ram his heavy metal body into Ethan's vehicle at high speed and is able to block the protagonist's attacks with wide metal sheets. Further into the battle, he regenerates his mass by drawing more scrap to himself and even grows a long metallic claw to grab Ethan's vehicle with. In the end, his decision to assemble himself into a gargantuan rotating fan proves fatal for him, since it allows Ethan to fire a cannon right into his core, obliterating Karl for good.",

            "constant": false,
            "content": "Mother Miranda is one of the three overarching antagonists (alongide Oswell E. Spencer and James Marcus) of the Resident Evil franchise. A brilliant biologist and leader of the cult known as the Four Houses, Miranda rules supreme over a village in Eastern Europe. It was there that she discovered the mold created from a being known as the \"Megamycete\", dedicating herself to studying it in the hopes of resurrecting her daughter Eva, who died from the Spanish flu in 1919. To this end, Miranda kidnapped the infant daughter of Ethan Winters and planned to use her as a vessel.\n\nTo further her studies of the mold, she became a head scientist for The Connections and overseer of the creation of Eveline, though she severed her ties with them after the cooperation proved fruitless for her own goals. She was also the mentor of Oswell E. Spencer, the founder of the Umbrella Corporation, meaning that she's an influence on all the events from the previous Resident Evil games.\n\nMiranda was born in the late 19th century in Eastern Europe, and would later birth a daughter named Eva around 1909. When the Spanish flu hit the village, Eva was one of the many who died from it, causing Miranda great grief that she attempted to commit suicide in a cave. In the northern cave, Miranda discovered the Megamycete, a fungal superorganism that gave her increased intelligence and powers such as immortality, mimicry and regeneration. Seeing that had memories of those who had come in contact with the superorganism, Miranda used her immortality gained by her mutation to master the art of biology and genetics in order to experiment with the Megamycete to find a way to resurrect her daughter. She then used the Cadou parasite on local villagers to find Eva a vessel, but they would often die or mutate into Lycans.\n\nDespite these setbacks, Miranda continued to experiment on villagers and came across four people who successfully bonded with the Cadou parasite. The four individuals were Alcina Dimitrescu, Karl Heisenberg, Donna Beneviento, and Salvatore Moreau, but found that they couldn't become Eva's vessel due to their response to the parasite. She decided to keep them to do her bidding, thus creating the Four Houses across the European village. She would also become the \"benevolent\" ruler of the village, and the villagers would call her \"Mother Miranda\". Around this time, Miranda saved Oswell E. Spencer, a British noble whom she saved from a skiing accident and mentored him how to mutate a being into something else using another lifeforms, but the two parted ways since Spencer wanted to manipulate mankind's evolution. Despite this, Spencer held Miranda in high regard, seeing her as the inspiration to achieve his goals as he became the founder of the Umbrella Corporation.\n\nA century later, Miranda would come into contact with the Connections, who offered to help her after they learned of her experiments with the mold. She agreed and gave them some of the Megamycete and her daughter's DNA, and became their head researcher that created Eveline. During the process, Miranda realized that Eveline wouldn't be fit to be Eva's vessel due to her being a bioweapon, and presumably returned to the village as the Connections went on create Eveline to be a bioweapon. Eveline would escape from her confinement and infect Connections researcher Mia Winters and the Baker family in Dulvey, Louisiana. Miranda would later be informed that Eveline was destroyed and that Mia was pregnant with a daughter, and realized that the child could be the prefect vessel for Eva.\n\nKeeping an eye on the couple, Miranda would decide to kidnap Mia and experiment on her for further research, but would take Mia's form to get close to Rose. Despite not knowing the personal history of the couple, Miranda managed to mimic Mia close enough to not alert Ethan Winters of his wife's disappearance.\n\nIn February, Miranda continued her guise as Mia until Chris Redfield discovered her motives, and decided to take Rosemary and kill Miranda. She feigned her death, making Ethan and Chris believe she succumbed to her wounds while Redfield took Rosemary and Ethan away from the house. Miranda awoke and attacked the transport that kept Rosemary and Ethan, taking the child and leaving Ethan alive so she could further her plans. She would then have Rosemary's body separated into four flasks, and gave the four lords each one to guard it. Her true goal with having her four lords guarding it was to have all of them eliminated by Winters to give more power to the fungal root, which Heisenberg had guessed years prior. In addition, Miranda saw no more use for the inhabitants of the village, and ordered Heisenberg to have the Lycans slaughter them to feed the Megamycete.\n\nWhile preparing for the ceremony, Miranda was alerted to Ethan's presence in the village and interrupted a Lycan horde from killing him. She then took on the form of \"The Hag\", and briefly speaks to Ethan before leaving the area when a bell sounds the call of another Lycan horde. When Ethan collected one of the masks to enter Castle Dimitrescu, Miranda killed Luiza's guard Iulian outside of her home, and returned to her hag form to manipulate Ethan. Mother Miranda returned to meet the four lords after Heisenberg captured Ethan, and allowed Karl to have Winters go through a short entertainment. Afterward, Miranda continued her plans and was informed by Alcina that Ethan escaped from Heisenberg's traps, and that she had him captured at her castle. Alcina would later call Mother Miranda, who told her not to kill Ethan despite losing her daughters to him.\n\nMother Miranda is later seen in her guise as the Hag after Ethan kills Alcina, and she informs Winters that the path he seeks is through the remaining lords. Doing this, Miranda manipulates Ethan into her plan to have him kill the rest of the lords to gather Rose to further power the fungus root in the village. She allows Ethan to collect the winged key, which leads him to eliminate Beneviento, Moreau and Heisenberg, who attempted to negotiate with Winters to help him eliminate Miranda. During these events, Redfield and his team realize that Miranda has regenerative capabilities, and decided to enter the village to set up stations across the church and Moreau's reservoir. Chris would later inform Ethan that he didn't kill the real Mia, and helped him destroy Heisenberg's factory.\n\nMiranda appears in the guise of Mia and mocks Ethan, before showing her hag and true form and telling Winters her plans to use Rose to resurrect her daughter. She then ripped out Ethan's heart, killing him and leaving to finish the ceremony while having large fungus protect her area. Upon having Rose complete the ceremony, Miranda realized that Rose didn't get resurrected as Eva, and that her powers are weakening presumably due to overuse or Ethan's connection to the fungus. Miranda then battles Ethan until she throws him onto the ground. As she attempts to strike him, he shoots her several times in the head, causing her to flail backwards before calcifying and turning to ashes. Ethan saves Rose and gives her to Chris, before blowing himself and the village up, destroying Miranda for good.\n\nEven death wasn't enough to stop Miranda's insanity. She persisted in the Megamycete's hive mind, where she was tried to create fake Roses to be Eva's vessel; though the lack of her daughter being in the realm with her heavily implied Miranda was too far gone from sanity to care that her efforts were pointless. Adding onto her anger, Miranda Eveline had taken over a stratum of the realm and kept interfering with her; with the failed experiment lashing back at her from abandonment. Miranda tested the fake Roses with her Duke clone, but they were all failures.\n\nBy 2036, Miranda sought to trick the real Rose into entering the realm and severing her powers. This almost worked, but Ethan was also in the Megamycete with them, allowing Rose to gain confidence and full control, permanently killing Miranda.\n\nMiranda is a power-crazed cult leader who attempted to use Rosemary Winters as a vessel to \"revive\" her late daughter, Eva. She only cared about \"reviving\" her daughter unlike her disciple, Spencer, who dreamed of ruling over mankind as a god. Driven into her delusions, Miranda still believed Rose was her daughter, Eva, even when the ceremony failed and Ethan angrily reminded her that Rose is his daughter and not hers, calling her a psycho and a witch.\n\nShe also shows her cruel and sadistic side when tormenting Ethan Winters, especially when she shapeshifted herself into the appearance of Mia Winters. Despite her cruelty towards him, she is nonetheless impressed that he had survived when learning he is also molded. She taunted him that she would give him a \"peaceful\" and permanent death.\n\nIn her seemingly last breath, she called out to her daughter one last time. When she fused with the Megamycete, she become monstrous and emotionally unstable when she attempted to kill both Ethan and Chris, only for the dying Ethan to commit suicide by detonating the bomb that Chris implanted on the Megamycete to kill both Miranda and himself.\n\nMutated Physiology: The walking mutation gave her immortal life, as well as significant regeneration with her being able to regenerate herself from five consecutive shots to the head. She had unrivaled shapeshifting skills, being able to manifest wings and even transform into a flock of birds, as well as perfectly imitating anyone in body and voice. She also had vast superhuman strength, speed and durability to such an extent that Heisenberg considered her a very big threat to oppose without an army and its own enhancements.\n\nGenius Intellect: Miranda is exceptionally intelligent, being a capable scientist and biologist, as well as a exclaimed strategist and experienced leader due to centuries of learning and comprehending knowledge gained to her by her immortality.\n\nManipulation: Like the way she easily passed by as Mia Winters, and not even Ethan noticed, and besides, she was known to be the cold and calculating leader of the Village, and manipulated them at his pleasure, and one example of this manipulation is the way in which she is treated by the villagers and three lords (excluding Heisenberg) as a kind of mother and religious figure to the point of blindly following her.",

            "content": "Little is known of Winters' early life, though it is known that by 2017 he was living and working in Los Angeles, California as a systems engineer. In May 2011 he married his Texan girlfriend, Mia, who he believed was a high-ranking employee in a trading company but was in fact a research assistant for The Connections, a manufacturer of illegal bioweapons. Mia disappeared in October 2014 while crossing the Gulf of Mexico during a hurricane, and was assumed dead.\n\nOn 18 July 2017, Winters received an email purported to be from Mia, giving him instructions to pick her up at the Baker ranch in Dulvey Parish, Louisiana. Rather than alert the authorities, Winters promptly drove out alone to find out for himself. Due to this choice in action, Winters was left unaware the general area was being investigated by law enforcement following a spate of disappearances, in fact instigated by the Baker family. Winters' initial search of the \"Guest House\" uncovered Mia's driver's license, as well as a snuff film depicting the death of Andre Stickland, with Winters finding his remains soon after. When searching the basement, Winters found Mia locked in a cell and freed her. Mia was found to be amnesiac, hearing voices and actively self-harming, before becoming hostile and forcing Winters to defend himself with an axe. Locked in the house by Jack Baker, Winters received a phone call from Jack's daughter, Zoe, which warned him to escape via the attic window. During this attempt, Winters was attacked once more by Mia, who cut his left hand off with a chainsaw before he could take her down with a handgun. This escape attempt was all for naught, however, and he was quickly captured by Jack, who inflicted severe brain damage on him with a stomp on the head. He then took the two back with him to the Main House.\n\nUnaware to Winters at the time, he and Mia as well as the Baker family had become contaminated by the Mold by a human bio-weapon named Eveline; this fungus replaces cells with more resilient fungal imitations. For mere minutes he was in a state of clinical death, only to begin waking up while being dragged into the Main House. As night fell, he was patched up by Zoe, who re-attached his hand and provided him with the Genome Codex, a special device which once belonged to Mia. Seeking a means of escape herself, she conscripted Winters into helping her, using his mutations to her advantage.\n\nWinters woke up strapped to a chair as the rest of the Baker family ate dinner - Jack, Marguerite, their son Lucas and Eveline. The family tried to pressure him into eating contaminated food to speed up the spread, but when he refused he was threatened with murder. Winters was, at this moment, only saved by the arrival of Deputy David Anderson on the property, who was sent out to investigate the disappearances. As the family left, Winters unstrapped himself and got the deputy's attention, though he was killed by Jack once entering the garage. Using the deputy's sidearm, Winters was able to weaken Jack, who then shot himself with the gun as a psychological tactic, knowing he would only recover later. With Winters, for the time being, free from pursuit, he received another call from Zoe, who instructed him on how to escape from the house by restoring puzzle pieces Jack had taken away to trap runaway victims.\n\nDuring Winters' search of the house he avoided attacks by the Molded, humanoid colonies of Mold created by the Bakers out of the decomposing corpses of their victims. During his search of the basement he encountered Jack once more, who was in the possession of one of the puzzle pieces while propping up Anderson's body. In his attempt to reach for it, he unknowingly walked into a trap, and was cornered in the Morgue with Jack armed with a chainsaw. Winters was, ultimately, victorious having used a second chainsaw to horizontally bisect him.\n\nAfter his escape from the Main House, Winters received further instructions by phone at Zoe's trailer in the back yard. There he was told that she and Mia were indeed infected by the same substance that afflicted her family, but there was a chance of treating them with a serum. Having already planned this for the past three years with Mia, Zoe pointed Winters to the dilapidated Old House, where he was to recover the arm of Dahlia, a human bio-weapon prototype; Zoe meanwhile had already recovered the head of Dahlia's sister, Dolores. In his search of the Old House, Winters briefly met up with Mia, who was no longer in a delirium. She was, however, snatched by Lucas from behind a chainlink fence, leaving him alone once more. As he explored further, Winters was attacked by Marguerite, who anticipated his search for Dahlia's arm. Their fighting collapsed part of the house, where a sinkhole had formed beneath the floorboards. Following her through a tunnel, Ethan fought Marguerite once more at the nearby greenhouse where she was killed and calcified. Returning to the Old House, Winters ventured upstairs and tracked down Dahlia's arm, attached to a lifelike doll in a shrine created by Marguerite. During his search of the upstairs he began to suffer visual and auditory hallucinations indicative of Mold infection, both seeing and hearing Eveline as a child.\n\nWhen Winters returned to the trailer to meet with Zoe, he found that Zoe had been captured by Lucas and was being held captive with Mia at the family barn. To gain entry, however, Lucas forced him to return to the Main House to recover two keycards. During the search, Winters was forced to insert his hand into Anderson's headless corpse, which was being quickly consumed by the Mold. When he did arrive at the barn, he was made to watch a video recording of Lucas self-harming while boasting the regenerative powers he had gained from the Mold, finally mocking Zoe's obsession with seeking a treatment. While navigating the barn and the many traps rigged by Lucas, Winters was forced to participate in an escape room activity themed on a birthday party. While solving the puzzle, Lucas tossed a bomb into the room through a hidden doorway when his intended booby trap failed. Winters' quick timing sent the bomb back, and Lucas ran out across the bayou to escape the explosion, leaving Dolores' head behind.\n\nHeading across the bayou, Winters reached the Boathouse where Mia and Zoe were being held captive. Winters freed the two women and gave the ingredients to Zoe to make the serum, intending to use a docked boat as their escape. When serum was produced, however, they were attacked by a heavily mutated Jack, who burst through the building and dragged Winters out where they fought once more. During the fight he was forced to use one of the serums, which caused an extreme reaction in Jack's body, causing rapid calcification. With one remaining serum left, Winters made the difficult choice of treating his own wife Mia over Zoe. Despite telling Zoe that he would help her, she angrily ordered him to leave with Mia on the boat.\n\nDuring their travel through the bayou, the two came across the wreckage of Annabelle, the tanker which transported Mia and Eveline. The ship had become home to a Fungal Root, which responded to their presence by destroying the boat and snatching away Winters. Embedded within a pile of Mold, he became mentally linked to the Fungal Root, and encountered an archive of Jack's mind. The man begged him to save his family in the real world by killing Eveline, but still he sympathised with her for her need of affection. Winters woke up being dragged out of the Fungal Root by Mia, who threw him off the ship to continue his mission while she remained on board, giving him a preserved tissue fragment from Eveline on the way.\n\nClose to the wreckage of Annabelle, Winters found himself at the Abercrombie Salt Mine, an abandoned mine being used both for Lucas' research and as storage space for hundreds of the Bakers' victims who were being consumed by the Mold. When he reached Lucas' lab, Winters was able to produce E-Necrotoxin, a poison designed by The Connections as a contingency should Eveline go rogue. As dawn arrived, a major operation was underway handled by the BSAA and Louisiana Army National Guard with support from the Louisiana State Police; while preparing for this battle however Eveline was not unaware of Winters' own progress in the caverns and sent Molded after him. Chased throughout by Molded, Winters found himself being led back to the Guest House he rescued Mia from the day before. As he explored the building, he was tortured with hallucinations of Mia attacking him with a chainsaw. In the attic he discovered Eveline herself, who was hiding from the BSAA that had already taken control of the Main House. Though she was able to hurt Winters with painful hallucinations, he was ultimately successful in injecting the E-Necrotoxin into her body. No longer being fooled by her hallucinatory abilities, he saw Eveline as the rapidly aged woman he met at the dining table rather than the child she once was.\n\nIn spite of the poison, Eveline was able to temporarily reconstitute herself, merging with the Mold in and beneath the Guest House to become a gargantuan, eldritch abomination bent on destroying Winters. This quickly got the attention of the BSAA, who flew a helicopter above to supply Winters with experimental anti-B.O.W. weaponry: the \"Albert-01\" and its \"RAMROD\" ammunition. The weapon was far more effective against Eveline, and after several rounds she quickly calcified. Following Eveline's death, the BSAA set up a basecamp where they coordinated the quarantine of the area. With information provided by Winters, a team rescued Mia from Annabelle and evacuated the two to the nearest BSAA base to get medical attention, while a search was underway to locate Zoe.\n\nIn the aftermath of the incident at the Baker ranch, the BSAA Investigations Department kept the Winters family in custody while they were treated for their wounds. The two went through surgery to remove clumps of Mold that had grown in their bodies. Over a period of several weeks they were interrogated for information, with the BSAA concluding that while Winters himself was a victim, Mia's ties to the Connections were undeniable. In exchange for her co-operation in the investigation into the crime syndicate, this information was not divulged to Winters and the two were moved to Eastern Europe to live under witness protection. It is possible that Winters was withheld knowledge of his mutant nature as part of this agreement.\n\nDuring their time in witness protection, the Winters were under constant surveillance from the BSAA. Contact with the outside world was limited, with letters and internet access being restricted to the point of being banned. In their second year of protection, Mia fell pregnant and gave birth to Rosemary in August 2020.\n\nIn early 2021, the BSAA was subject to a data leak, exposing both the Winterses location and the existence of Rosemary. This information soon reached Miranda, a mutant with shapeshifting abilities who had worked with The Connections on creating Eveline. Seeing Rosemary as an ideal subject for an experiment in consciousness transfer, she abducted Mia and took her form. Miranda lived in the house for several days, and was able to maintain the deception, even going shopping and looking after Rosemary. Although the two argued a number of times, there is evidence to suggest Winters and the real Mia were already having problems, with the only other sign of the switch being Miranda's fondness for local cuisine.\n\nUnknown to Winters and Miranda, they were now subject to reconnaissance by the BSAA, who had obtained reliable information regarding Miranda's base of operations and her fascination with Rosemary. On February 2, 2021, they celebrated Rose's half birthday. On the 6th, he and Mia began to argue when he brought up the Baker House Incident as he felt a part of him still trapped there. On a fateful night, he expresses his concern over his wife Mia telling Rose a local fairy tale named Village of Shadows. She then sarcastically ask him to put his daughter to bed. He complies and takes her to her bed cradle; on the way he thinks how everyone had quickly forgotten the Baker Incident. When she is preparing for dinner, Ethan notes her as someone who had gone full native. Mia then tells Ethan to stop worrying, and he notes recent events moving fast. He and his wife then have an argument, Ethan accusing his wife of forgetting everything that had happened in Louisiana. Mia is then shot in the shoulder by an unseen assailant. Ethan quickly tells her to get down but she is shot multiple times before seemingly being killed by Chris, much to Ethan's horror. When they are ordered to take them out of the house, a member of Chris's Hound Wolf Squad gives Rose to Chris, with Ethan furiously asking Chris what he was doing to his daughter. Ethan plans to attack Chris but before he can do so he is knocked unconscious. He is dragged out of the house on Chris's orders. Ethan recalls a time he argued with Mia about their fears over Rosemary's true nature and the effects she might have inherited from the both of them. Their argument ends when he answers a call from his job.\n\nEthan awakens at his overturned convoy, with the guards dead and Rosemary nowhere to be seen. He picks up a nearby ringing phone where he demands the caller to divulge Chris's and Rose's location, only to be denied an answer. He then sets off to a nearby trail filled with blood and dead carcasses. He then stumbles on to an old shack and starts to explore the nearby surroundings, before coming across a large village, which he finds recently deserted.\n\nHe eventually encounters a villager, Grigori Stan, hiding and armed with a shotgun. He interrogates Ethan, but before Ethan can respond, the house is surrounded by werewolf-like people known as Lycans. Grigori offers a handgun to Ethan before he is killed by a Lycan, while Ethan is dragged down to the basement by another Lycan. Landing in a pile of villager corpses, a Lycan attacks and bites his left pinkie and ring finger off. He kills the Lycan and escapes the basement, entering another house. There, he is attacked by a horde of Lycans. Surviving a wave of the monsters, Ethan overhears a radio transmission telling any survivors to come to Luiza's house. However, upon exiting the house, a large pack of Lycans led by the giant Uriaș converge on him. But before they can kill him, the bells at the castle ring and the horde runs off.\n\nEthan then comes across an old woman, who asks if he was the \"child's father\"; when he confirms this, the woman proclaims that after Rosemary was brought to the village by the village deity Mother Miranda, they have \"fallen into darkness\" and warns him that she is in great danger. Ethan sees the nearby castle and surmises that he might find Rose there. Eventually, he comes across two surviving villagers, Elena and her injured father, Leonardo, who are hoping to join the rest of the survivors at Luiza's House but no one is letting them in. As the Lycans start to lurk nearby, Ethan manages to climb over Luiza's house and open the gate for Elena and Leonardo before sealing it. Although they are given a cold welcome by a hesitant Iulian, the group is welcomed into the home by Luiza.\n\nLuiza then guides him to the house, meeting other survivors: the drunken Anton, the mourning Roxana, and the crippled Sebastian. Ethan asks if this is all that remains from the village and Anton angrily responds that there is no one left before insulting the survivors and chastising Luiza for letting in the injured Leonardo and Ethan, an outsider. Luiza responds that her house has been protecting her family for generations and that she reassures him that all are welcome and safe in there. When Ethan asks what is going on around the area, she tells him that they were once a quiet devout village, but then the monsters came and attacked them. Elena asks where Luiza's husband is, to which she answers that he went outside to get help. Roxana then suggests for them to pray to Mother Miranda for his safety, they all join hands and pray; Ethan notices the prayer reminded him of the old woman's words. Leonardo calls the old woman crazy, but Luiza instead believes it is through the woman's devotion that she is still alive.\n\nSuddenly, Leonardo roars in pain before attacking and killing Luiza with his machete, as well as knocking over a lantern that causes a fire. Ethan beckons Elena to escape as Leonardo, exhibiting Lycan abilities, kills the rest of the survivors. Leonardo pounces at Ethan before Elena fires at her father with a shotgun blast. As the two escape into the garage, Elena mourns her father as Ethan manages to get Luiza's truck working in hopes to ram their way outside. When he instead crashes the car, the two decide to escape upwards to the attic, where Elena warns Ethan that the castle is \"nothing but blood and death.\"\n\nLeonardo, somehow still alive, manages to climb upward and calls out to Elena in pain. Despite Ethan's warnings, Elena quickly runs to him when the wooden plank providing her way back collapses, separating the two, before Leonardo falls into the fire. Despite Ethan offering help, Elena tells him to go and to save his daughter before the floor collapses and she falls into the fiery depths below. Ethan leaves the burning house through a window and frustratingly notes that people keep dying around him. He steps outside only to witness Mother Miranda killing Iulian; after pursuing her, he then encounters the old woman from before who happily states that death has visited them all. He manages to open the stone door leading to the Castle using two crests found around the village.\n\nEthan heads to the castle but is captured by a man with electromagnetic powers before he can enter. The man drags him to meeting with Mother Miranda and four other “lords”: Alcina Dimitrescu, Donna Beneviento, Salvatore Moreau, and his captor Karl Heisenberg. Dimitrescu and Heisenberg argue who should have him, with her wanting to kill Ethan, offering his blood to Miranda, and Heisenberg wanting to put on an entertaining show for everyone to enjoy. Miranda decides that Ethan's fate belongs to Heisenberg. He begins counting down from ten as Ethan jumps down a hole in the corner of the room. He narrowly avoids Lycans and traps and manages to escape.\n\nMaking his way out of the trap tunnel, Ethan arrives in front of Dimitrescu's castle. There he meets The Duke, a merchant who offers him weapons and supplies (in exchange for Lei) for his journey ahead. As he enters the castle in hopes of finding Rose, he is captured by Dimitrescu's daughters Bela, Cassandra, and Daniela. They drag him to meet their mother, who is surprised that he survived Heisenberg's game. She orders them to hang Ethan up by hooking both of his hands. After this, Dimitrescu goes to inform Miranda of Ethan's survival. While they are gone, he manages to free himself by forcefully ripping his hands through the hook. After traversing through areas of the castle, he comes across The Duke, conveniently settled in room in the castle. The Duke suggests that Dimitrescu is keeping Rose in her private chambers somewhere in the castle.\n\nAs Ethan explores the castle, he encounters Cassandra, who attacks him. He narrowly escapes by jumping down a shaft, and crawls to the castle's wine tasting room. From there, he passes through the castle's dungeon, where he fights off several mutated women known as Moroaicǎ. Arriving back at the main floor of the castle, Ethan is attacked and caught by Bela. Ethan attempts to shoot her, but his bullets do nothing. Instead, a stray shot breaks a window, letting in the cold winter air. Bela, horrified by what he has done, becomes vulnerable to Ethan's attacks. He manages to kill the weakened Bela, who calcifies and crumbles to the ground.\n\nEthan makes his way through the castle, solving more puzzles and battling various Moroaicǎ, before overhearing a conversation between Dimitrescu and Miranda on the phone. Dimitrescu demands Miranda's permission to kill Ethan as he has already killed one of her daughters, though Miranda refuses and orders that he stay alive to participate in an upcoming 'ceremony'. However, after the call ends, Dimitrescu throws her vanity in frustration, and decides to kill Ethan anyway. He sneaks in to her chambers and finds the Dimitrescu key, but is caught by the Lady. She proceeds to violently slam him against the floor, causing it to break and send him to the dungeons below. He navigates the dungeon and eventually finds the exit door's switch, but gets his hand sliced off by Dimitrescu's sharp claws. Evading her attacks, he retrieves his hand and escapes the dungeon. He is later cornered by Cassandra in the arsenal room, but manages to weaken her by throwing a pipe bomb to a cracked exterior wall. The chilly winter air enters the room and Ethan is able to kill Cassandra. Eventually, he is captured by Daniela in the library. There, he is able to open the skylight and let the wind in to weaken and kill her.\n\nEthan learns of a weapon called the Dagger of Death's Flowers, which is imbued with poisons from around Europe. He finds it sealed away with the corpse of the last man who attempted to use it against Dimitrescu. The Lady then appears behind him, and stabs him with her claws. In retaliation, he stabs her with the dagger. Dimitrescu becomes furious and throws him through a window, causing the dagger to be lost after it falls off the tower of the castle. Enraged, Dimitrescu mutates into a grotesque dragon-like creature, and the two battle atop one of the castle's towers. While Ethan emerges victorious, the floor suddenly crumbles underneath them and they both fall to the bottom of the tower. Ethan miraculously survives the fall while Lady Dimitrescu's body calcifies. At the tower's base, he finds a dirty flask and heads to a nearby cave.\n\nThere he meets the old woman again chanting the same prayers as before. Ethan demands she tell him what is going on and where Miranda took Rose. She laughs, telling him that Rose will be sacrificed as a life for a life. She points out that the crest of the four families may open a path that he seeks. Ethan stares at the emblem, eerily similar to the logo of the Umbrella Corporation.\n\nHe then travels to the Altar, where he meets the Duke once more. The Duke then notices Ethan had picked up something of value, and when Ethan shows it to him, the Duke claims that Ethan is holding Rose right in his hands. Ethan, horrified, realizes that he is holding his own daughter's head inside the flask. The Duke claims that Rose can be saved and points Ethan to a house with a red chimney on the western side of the Village. Ethan is reluctant to go but does so regardless as he has run out of options, promising to kill the Duke if he is lying. Sometime later, Ethan returns with the four-winged key. The Duke then tells him to use it and save his daughter by collecting Rose's remaining flasks and that each of them is guarded by the 3 remaining Houses that served under Miranda.\n\nFollowing the Duke's advice, Winters ventured south-east through the Potter's Field towards House Beneviento. As he approached the house, Winters suffered a series of hallucinations of Mia and Rose, who beckoned him onward. These were caused by the psychotropic effects of mutant flowers growing in the area, which could be influenced by Donna Beneviento. Winters was lured down an elevator to Beneviento's doll workshop and was sealed below. Down there, Winters' hallucinations became more and more intense, finally encountering a deformed hallucinatory version of Rose so vivid it seemed as though real. In spite of this, Winters was successful in escaping the workshop, something Beneviento herself did not expect. To prevent his escape, she carried Angie around the house with the flask, using her influence on Winters' mind to make her seem invisible to him while she fought back.[39] Armed with a pair of scissors, Winters was ultimately the winner, and killed Beneviento by stabbing her in the face.[40]\n\nFollowing Beneviento's defeat, Winters travelled north through the Old Town and headed to the reservoir and the ruins of the fishing village it had swallowed. Moving through a mine, Winters found the third flask, but was prevented from escape by Salvatore Moreau, a greatly deformed mutant unable to control his metamorphic abilities. Following this initial encounter, Winters took off towards the reservoir in search of another way back to the village. During the journey, Winters was ambushed by Redfield, Canine and Night Howl, who were conducting research and reconnaissance on the mutants. Their meeting was brief, and was disrupted by Moreau, who had taken on the form of a large fish-like creature.[41] Crossing the reservoir on the roofs of the former village, Winters was able to restore power to the dam and drain the water. Out of his habitat, Moreau was forced to clumsily fight Winters on land while he remained in his fish form, a battle Moreau soon lost.\n\nOn his way back through the mines, Winters saw a television broadcast from Karl Heisenberg, who revealed he had been keeping tabs of his progress. Rather than follow the same pattern as his predecessors, Heisenberg hoped to strike a deal with Winters, who would give him Rose in exchange for his own survival so Miranda could be defeated. Aided by Heisenberg's instructions, Winters was able to recover the fourth flask at the Mediaeval fort to the west. Whether having already begun or just at this point, Winters took Heisenberg's advise and placed all four flasks within the Giant's Chalice, an ancient artefact which restored Rose to life and through which he was able to see her memories. Winters took the chalice to the Ceremony Site, which revealed an ancient and highly sophisticated elevator and bridge mechanism.\n\nEthan puts all of them in the altar and carries the Giant's chalice to the other pedestal where it descends down and opens up to Heisenberg's factory. He gets inside and is greeted by Karl, who tells Ethan that he is being tested to see if he is strong enough to be part of Miranda's family, Ethan angrily exclaims that he doesn't want to be a part of her family and neither did Karl. He also says that even Miranda was scared of how potentially dangerous Rose is. He then offers Ethan to go together and save Rose and use her to kill Miranda. Ethan rejects his offer saying that his daughter is not a weapon for his usurping scheme. Heisenberg then kicks Ethan down to the bottom of his factory.\n\nEthan is then chased around by Sturm, a creature with its entire body made up of propeller fans. He manages to evade it but finds himself deeper into the factory where he fights off several creatures wearing and gearing metal gears. He navigates around the factory, intending to get upstairs to escape. After solving some puzzles on the way and turning the backup generator on, Heisenberg displays his disappointment towards Ethan through the microphone and explains that she forcefully takes the others as her children, locks them up away in the village and decades of servitude. While the others have no problem with Miranda, Heisenberg wants to be free from her so he needs immense power to destroy her. Miranda had always treated them as nothing but her children, she had never cared for them and has long since lost all of her humanity and if she started the ceremony with Rose then it would be over for her and the village alike. He assures him that he would use Rose to fulfil his cause.\n\nShortly afterwards he is pursued again by Sturm, he proceeds to evade and battle it, using its weak point to his advantage, Ethan finally kills it. After reaching topside, he is attacked by Heisenberg's electromagnetic abilities and is dropped the ground again. After he crawls through a vent, he is alerted by noises but is subdued and disarmed by Chris, who has infiltrated the factory and is in the middle of planting explosives beneath it. Chris tells him to stay away, but Ethan angrily exclaims that he killed Mia. Chris starts to explain that the Mia he shot wasn't the real Mia but in fact Miranda the entire time, a bioweapon with the ability to change her cells and mimic the person, but she doesn't have the former's memories. Ethan angrily demanded to know why he was never informed of this only for Chris to shout that Ethan would want to be involved. Ethan asks him to explain everything.\n\nChris explains that Miranda is insane and that the monsters and village was her life's work—her experimentation with the Mold itself. Ethan sulked realizing it's just like that of Dulvey, Louisiana and that he can't save his family nor he can do anything. Chris then tosses him his phone, asking him to look in the pictures. In one of the pictures, Ethan realizes that Miranda has possession of all four flasks and Chris's men are still monitoring the situation. Ethan wants to save Rose immediately but Chris tells him that he cant go up against Miranda herself. Chris advises him to take Heisenberg's self-propelled artillery and meet him topside while he finishes planting explosives. Chris promises Ethan that they will together get his daughter back. Chris then lastly asks him to stay under the radar.\n\nHe takes the artillery and rides the elevator up to the surface, he faces against the mutated Heisenberg, who is now a creature that is fused with metal parts. After an intensive battle, Heisenberg overturns the artillery and he is about to kill Ethan until he is momentarily distracted from the explosion in the factory. Ethan is forced to fight him head on with the weapons he has. Heisenberg then uses his ability again in an attempt to kill Ethan, but he manages to get into the artillery and fires a grenade shot, killing Karl.\n\nEthan is then called by Chris, who heard an intense explosion from above. He informs him that he has killed Karl and that he is going take Rose back from Miranda. Chris tells him not to go without him and tells him to wait. Ethan is momentarily distracted by the sound of Rose's crying; he turns around to see \"Mia\" walking towards him and says that Rose is important to her and chastises him for never knowing that she had taken Mia's place. \"Mia\" is then warped to Miranda, and she begins to tell him about Eveline's power over the Mold and Rose is her successor, her true complete form, and that she will grow up to control the masses and that she must have her. Miranda says that the Fungus Root catalogues all of them and Rose will be reborn as her daughter Eva. Miranda then begins to shift through several forms including that of the crazy old hag. Ethan angrily tells her to come out and face him only for Miranda to appear below him and rip out his heart. She tells him that he will be a part of the Fungus Root's records as he collapses to the ground.\n\nWhile unconscious, Winters was taunted by what he discovered was a fragment of Eveline's consciousness that existed within his mind. Eveline mockingly asks him if he had ever questioned why, despite all the fatal injuries he had suffered both at the Baker residence and in the Village, he had always completely recovered. Eveline explains that back at the Baker guest house after he had defeated the Molded Mia for the last time and Jack Baker knocked him unconscious, the head stomp had actually killed him. However, the Mold in the Baker residence had managed to revive him and mutated him as well, thus giving him the same inhuman regenerative abilities as Mia and the Bakers. Although initially in despair, Ethan resolved to save Rose, even if it's the last thing he's going to do.\n\nIt was revealed that he survived the attack from Miranda due to his regenerative capabilities thanks to the Mold. Ethan wakes up in the Duke's carriage to find Rose and end Miranda once and for all. The Duke takes Ethan to the village where he finds Miranda with Rose, believing she is her daughter, Eva.\n\nEthan confronts Miranda, as much to her surprise. Ethan demands she give back Rose, with Miranda threatening him, only for Chris to intervene and shoot her in the head, giving Ethan an opportunity to take back Rose. Miranda, however, grabs ahold of Rose before the Fungus Root spreads around the area, mutating her further.\n\nAfter a long battle, Ethan strikes a killing blow to Miranda, causing her to yell her daughter's name before calcifying as the barrier around them starts to dissipate as well. Ethan takes his daughter back, only to fall onto his knees in weakness after his right hand calcifies. Chris finds a frail Ethan, assisting them to their safety. Chris informs Ethan of a bomb that will obliterate the entire village and how Mia is actually alive waiting for him. After leaving some tearful parting words to both Rose and Chris, along with his bloodied jacket to cover his daughter, Ethan then gives Rose to Chris before stealing the bomb's trigger as he pushes them when tree root-like Mold grows to surround the area.\n\nIn one final attempt to destroy the Fungus Root, Ethan activates the trigger, sacrificing himself as the bomb destroys both the Fungus Root and the entire village. His death brought grief to both Mia and Chris.\n\nFollowing his death, a remnant of his consciousness is absorbed into the Fungal Root and its records per Miranda's words, thus he can manifest on different levels of stratum including the very core level. 16 years after his death, his daughter Rose links herself to the surviving piece of the Fungal Root in order to locate a Purifying Crystal to rid herself of her Mold affiliations and live out her life as a normal girl. Sensing her presence and knowing of the dangers that the Realm of Consciousness presides, Ethan seeks to help and guide his daughter through the realm safely. When Rose is cornered by presence of Face Eaters, Ethan uses his strength to guide her out safely in the form of golden dust and communicates in a series of written messages.\n\nIn a moment of peace, Rose questions his identity but not wanting to complicate things further, he chooses the name \"Michael\". (From Saint Michael the Archangel from one of Rose's suggestions as she sees him acting as her guardian angel) Ethan tries to persuade her into leaving the realm but Rose is adamant in continuing her objective and relents to assisting her along the way. Upon being spotted by The Masked Duke over her excitement of the crystal's sight, Ethan gives her his LEMI and supplies needed to survive and evade her capture by Face Eaters while also provide guidance in acquiring all the pieces necessary to release the crystal from its cage. Acquiring all the pieces necessary, Rose retrieves the crystal only to distraught at the fact that it had been a replica as it crumbles to dust. She is transported to an underground arena to fight against the Executioner. When Rose manages to bring down the creature, The Masked Duke angrily seeks her death as he attempts to corner her with Face Eaters but Ethan manages to guide her and escape to the next stratum.\n\nAt the next stratum, Rose finds herself on the gardens of House Beneviento where Ethan warns her that the further she goes, the harder it is to escape from the current stratum and tries to persuade her into leaving the realm once more but she reaffirms her determination in continuing her objective much to Ethan's ire and reluctance in assisting her. Upon entering inside the house, Ethan is forcibly separated away from Rose due to interference of an unknown entity within the second stratum with Rose forced to continue alone for the time being. During this time, Ethan scrambles to search for Rose and reunites with her once more after she is chased down by large dolls heads taunting her and ridiculing her father and enlarged Mia mannequin. Rose is recoiled by the experience and expresses that she does not know anything about her father besides the fact that he had died in protecting her and wonders how her life would have turned out had her father is still with her and convey her desire of wanting to know more about him which Ethan agrees to show her in the form of her childhood home when she is still in infancy. While there, Ethan tells her to take her time exploring the surrounding area with Rose discovering various items filled with memories and voices of her father on her half birthday which had taken place 16 years prior. In her exploration, Rose finds her dad's letter addressed to her on her birthday to which she finds emotional comfort in. She soon gets interrupted by Eveline who had found Rose and drags her back to the Beneviento property.\n\nWhen Eveline's envy and hatred goes out of control, she attempts to destroy the house in hopes of killing her but Rose eludes her way to the elevator. She is grasped on by Eveline who conveys her desire of wanting Mia and Ethan dead so that they can be reunited as a family in death. Ethan manages to break Eveline's grasp on Rose by forcibly deter her away with his power but only for short amount of time to which Ethan warns Rose about. When they arrive at the floor, Ethan urges his daughter to use her power and suppress Eveline's abilities with her weaken form will allow him to bring them to safety and reassures her that she can do it. Rose confronts Eveline and successfully uses her abilities in suppressing and weakening her form with Ethan managing to defeat her. Rose approaches Eveline but is thrown off and prepares to kill her until Ethan physically manifests himself and push her off to safety and into the next stratum where he urges her to find the crystal.\n\nRose awakens and finds herself on the grounds of the Village. Realizing that the man has the same voice as him, Rose finds out his hidden identity which reawakens her determination in locating the crystal. When Rose locates and utilizes the crystal, Miranda shows herself and corners Rose until Ethan manifests himself at the core level of stratum once again, much to Miranda's surprise. Miranda prepares to attack them both until Ethan intervenes and they both escape with Rose questioning why Ethan decides to maintain his guardian angel identity to which he reveals his reason. Miranda manages to catch up and grasp onto Rose but Ethan intervenes once again and urges her to leave and live her life normally only for Miranda to incapacitate him. Unable to abandon her father and embracing her identity, Rose breaks the Purifying Crystal and absorbs all the abilities and begins to fight Miranda. When Miranda proves too much to handle, Ethan gave his power to Rose to which she absorbed and brings down Miranda, finally destroying her consciousness within the realm.\n\nIn a moment of peace, Rose and Ethan embraces and shares one last moment together before Rose finds herself back in the real world, holding his wedding ring and glad to finally have the chance of meeting him. Following Rose's experience inside the Realm of Consciousness, she goes to the graveyard and pays respect to her father's grave.",

            "constant": false,
            "content": "Mia was a resident of Texas in the 2000s when she began dating Ethan Winters. In 2010, she began working as a researcher for The Connections, a crime syndicate specializing in production of bio-weaponry. This was kept secret from Ethan, who she would marry on May 29, 2011. Whether they moved to California at this point or if Ethan did on his own is presently uncertain.\n\nA few years after her marriage to Ethan, Mia took on the job of a handler for the first successful E-Type bioweapon known simply as Eveline. Alongside her colleague Alan Droney, she was tasked with transporting Eveline on the cargo ship Annabelle to a facility in Central America. During the voyage, Mia sent a heart-warming video message to her husband Ethan saying that she misses him and that she cannot wait to be finished with her \"babysitting\" job.\n\nWhen the ship's course fell in the path of a hurricane, Eveline started to become unstable, attacking Alan and infecting the crew members who would then be turned into Molded. Arming herself with a submachine gun, Mia was to track down and pursue her throughout the ship, realizing that Eveline had bonded with her and thought of her as her mother. After briefly reuniting with Alan, Mia witnessed his horrific death via Eveline's mold before she herself was infected by it. Realizing her impending doom, Mia desperately tried to send Ethan a second video message, urging him to forget their relationship and wishing him a good life. She is soon after thrown from the ship into the waters as the tanker continues to be destroyed.\n\nWhen the tanker washed up in the bayou of Dulvey, Louisiana, Jack Baker discovered Mia amongst the wreckage and brought her back to the Baker estate, housing her in his daughter Zoe's trailer. During this time, Mia wrote a letter thanking the Baker family for their kindness as well as warning them not to approach Eveline along with the consequences of doing so. Before she could finish the letter, she fell unconscious and, unbeknownst to her, Jack had already found Eveline and brought her into the mansion, leading to their infection and subsequent madness.\n\nMia, under the influence of Eveline, sent a brief and cryptic email to her husband Ethan, only telling him to find her at the Baker farm in Dulvey, Louisiana. When he arrived, he found Mia unconscious and locked in a cell below the Baker guest house – upon waking, she was shocked to see Ethan and doubted her involvement in his arrival. In a panic, Mia guided Ethan through the basement – however, the couple reached a dead end, much to Mia's distress. While Mia rested on a nearby couch, Ethan tried to look for another way out, leading her to be captured by an unknown assailant who bashed through a hidden door in the wall.\n\nAfter Ethan followed through the door and investigated the ground floor area, he was attracted back to the basement by a persistent knocking, only to be greeted by a monstrous version of Mia climbing up the stairs. She grabs and throws Ethan with tremendous strength back up the stairs and against the wall, attacking him with a knife. After a brief struggle between the two, Ethan disarmed Mia and she briefly returned to her normal self, alluding to him that Eveline would not get out of her head as she bashed it repeatedly against the wall before knocking herself unconscious. However, she quickly rose back up and grabbed Ethan, throwing him through a wall and grabbing a sharp piece of wood to fight once again. Ethan was able to defend himself with an axe, and after a short duel he struck the weapon into her neck causing her to lapse back to her normal self and collapse in her apparent death. While Ethan was distracted by a mysterious phone call, she managed to rise once again and flee further into the house, wandering around ominously and eventually jumping Ethan after he had returned power to the attic stairs. First appearing normal and apologetic to Ethan's previous attack, she quickly turned and pinned him to the wall by stabbing a screwdriver through his left hand. As Ethan desperately struggled to get the screwdriver out, Mia obtained a chainsaw with the intention to butcher Ethan, but at the last moment Ethan freed himself and raised his left arm in defense as Mia sawed it off. As Mia continued to fight for control over her body, she wandered upstairs with Ethan in pursuit. The pair went head to head in a fight in the attic but Ethan prevailed and Mia fell to the floor, muttering \"I love you\" to him. Once Jack apprehended Ethan, the couple were both taken into the main Baker estate.\n\nAt some point between their capture and Ethan's escape, Mia recorded a videotape for him to watch. In it, she tried to explain that the monster is not her true self while she ran away from Marguerite, entering the Old House while coming across several key items and a puzzle that Ethan would later need to solve. However, she is soon cornered in a small crawlspace by Marguerite and recaptured.\n\nOnce Ethan entered the Old House and obtained the Stone Statuette he required to solve the house's shadow puzzle, Mia briefly reunited with him on the other side of a chain link fence. As Ethan demanded answers from her, she was grabbed and dragged off by Lucas Baker. She would later be found hand-tied to the wall of the Boathouse alongside Zoe Baker as Ethan made his way through Lucas's death trap. Ethan eventually reached them and freed them both, giving Zoe the necessary ingredients required to craft two serums that could cure both herself and Mia. However, a heavily mutated Jack separated Ethan from the girls, and eventually left Ethan no choice but to use one of the serums on Jack in order to defeat him, forcing Ethan to use the other serum on Mia. They both pleaded with Zoe to join them in their escape, but she angrily refuses and orders them to leave, believing herself doomed.\n\nThe couple rode into the swamp on a boat, but as they came across the old wreckage of the tanker, the Mold grew over and flipped the boat, causing both to be submerged underwater. Mia soon regains consciousness outside the wreckage and desperately hunts for Ethan, who is quickly captured by Eveline and taken deeper into the wreckage. As Mia made her way through the ship, she regained her memories of Eveline and her origin through a videotape which relived the fall of the tanker, giving her more determination to free Ethan.\n\nMia discovered where Ethan was being held through a security camera system on the bridge and made her way down to him, freeing him. Despite Ethan's confusion, Mia quickly handed him Eveline's tissue samples in the hopes that he might be able to craft the necrotoxin necessary to kill Eveline and shut him off in a nearby corridor, urging him to leave as quickly as possible before Eveline regained control of her and separated the couple using the Mold.\n\nAfter Ethan left to take down Eveline, Mia was rescued by BSAA operators. Shortly after Ethan successfully killed Eveline, they were reunited while being evacuated from the area via helicopter.\n\nAfter this, she would cooperate with the BSAA and provide any information that they wanted to know in exchange for not letting Ethan learn of her past with the crime syndicate. She clarifies that she wants to move on from her past. Mia, along with Ethan, fell under witness protection. The couple would then start to reside in Europe. Mia then sends Zoe a letter detailing her current life and location, although she can't share where she is specifically in Europe. She expresses her desire for Zoe to visit them and meet their infant daughter.\n\nThree years and two months after the Baker Incident, Mia and Ethan stay happily married. During this time Mia would give birth to a baby girl whom they named Rosemary Winters. For six months, they were a happy family, though during this time Mia would keep a secret from her husband which she would feel guilty about, as she doesn't want to ruin her family or lose Ethan.\n\nOn February 2, 2021, they celebrated Rose's half birthday and on the 6th, when Ethan accidentally brings up the Dulvey incident, they had a fight partially because of years her carrying on the secret. Shortly after this, Mia was kidnapped and subjected to multiple experiments by her former colleague Miranda, who wished to use Rose as a vessel for her deceased child Eva. Miranda locked Mia up in her lab and impersonated her, taking her place in an attempt to abduct Rose from Ethan.\n\nOn February 10, 2021, she was rescued by Chris who was on his mission to rescue Rose and destroy Miranda and the Black God. Chris initially feared that Miranda was impersonating Mia, but Umber Eyes reassured him that Miranda was still at the ceremony site. Chris then headed to the ceremony site, leaving Mia in the lab for her safety. She then told him that he can't leave her here and that he promised he would keep them safe, even going so far as to moving to Eastern Europe, as long as they were together. Mia angrily demanded that he tell her where her husband and daughter are, causing him to solemnly respond that Ethan is gone, having been killed by Miranda, but he stated he can still save her daughter, Rose. Mia denied that Ethan is gone, proceeding to tell him the secret that she had been keeping for years, that Ethan was in fact killed by Jack Baker after his fight with Mia up at the attic and that the only thing that is keeping him alive is the Mold.\n\nAfterwards, Chris returned to her with Rose cradled in his arms. She is found to be relieved to see her daughter alive and well. When Chris ordered them to pull up, she realized that Ethan is nowhere to be seen. He tells her to strap and sit down but she demands that he tell her what happened to Ethan, only for the N2 explosion (caused by Ethan in an effort to destroy the Black God) to go off, sending shockwaves destabilizing the trajectory of the helicopter. Mia horrifyingly realizes that her husband had sacrificed himself so that they could escape. Chris angrily and tearfully tells her that he had tried to save him but failed, and subsequently apologizes for failing her. Mia then sobs and hugs her daughter for comfort after learning of her husband's heroic sacrifice.\n\nYears later, she raised Rose to be a strong adult woman, helping her study with loving and caring to Rose, before the beginning of elementary school and Chris would be her mentor in controlling her newfound abilities. But by the year 2037, Rose is soon put under the custody of Chris and the Hound Wolf Squad with Rose only seldom seeing her mother.",

            "content": "Rose was born on 2 August 2020 whilst her parents were under BSAA protection. Due to the family's mutations as well as Mia's former ties to The Connections, they were at serious risk of abduction for experimentation or even assassination. While there is evidence suggesting they were moved repeatedly, by 2021 they were living in a mountain range in Eastern Europe.\n\nSometime in early 2021, BSAA Europe suffered an information leak, exposing the Winters' location and the results of a medical checkup which identified Rose's mutant nature. Though this leak was soon realised, by February it had reached Mother Miranda, a shapeshifting Superhuman based in a remote mountain village who was searching for fellow Superhumans to use in her experiments. By Monday 8 February Miranda had successfully infiltrated the Winters household by abducting and imitating Mia; this got the attention of the BSAA, who attempted to assassinate her during a raid. The body, Ethan and Rose were then taken away on a BSAA armoured car where they were to undergo testing. During the trip, Miranda woke up, killed the two operators and crashed the car on the outskirts of the village. Rose was unharmed in the crash, and was taken away to the village.\n\nIn the early hours of Tuesday 9th February, Rose was delivered to the Ceremony Site, the ruins of an ancient civilization that once dominated the mountains. Having long studied the Black God which lived beneath the soil, Miranda believed that Rose alone was suitable in her final experiment, which aimed to replace her conscious mind with that of Eva, her deceased daughter who was assimilated by Black God in 1919. In order to feed the Black God ahead of the procedure, Miranda allowed for the wholesale slaughter of the region's inhabitants to serve as a sacrifice, with Rose herself crystallised and split into four fragments under the protection of the Four Lords until the procedure, or \"ceremony\", was ready.\n\nOver the course of the day, Ethan Winters searched for his daughter's remains, fed on information provided by Duke and Miranda herself, who in secret wanted her deputies dead to prevent any interference. By the evening the four fragments were reunited within the Holy Grail, an ancient relic designed as a means of communicating with Black God. The act itself triggered its rapid growth as Miranda had anticipated, and she was able to recover the Holy Grail to continue the procedure in Ethan's absence.\n\nThe procedure took place just before dawn on the morning of Wednesday 10 February. During the procedure, Miranda communicated with Black God and attempted to exchange Rose and Eva's consciousnesses, following which Rose was returned to her imitation human form. The procedure however proved unsuccessful owing to Rose's innate influence over the Mold; the consciousnesses were not exchanged, and Miranda herself was left in a weakened state in the process. This weakness allowed Ethan to fight and destroy Miranda's physical body and rescue Rose, though his own body was in the process of dying due to wounds he suffered and Rose was handed over to BSAA Captain Chris Redfield who had himself rescued Mia. Rose and Mia were brought to a BSAA tiltrotor and flown out of the village as Ethan set off an N2 explosive to destroy Black God.\n\nIn the aftermath of the incident, Rose was placed in protective custody by the US government. As a Superhuman she both represented a direct security risk to the United States, and could be valuable as a tool for international bio-weapons developers. Rose was raised by Mia for a time, and saw regular check-ups from Redfield and his comrades who she saw as extended family. Despite her nature, Rose was allowed a regular education and was enrolled at an elementary school; the faculty were aware of her mutant nature, and Redfield met with them to assure them she was safe owing to safety concerns. Rose's experiences at school were poor, and she was met with physical and verbal bullying over her mutant nature, which manifested with the excretion of a white substance in her sweat when stressed. Among Rose's regular bullies were Lucy, Catherine and Jimmy, who pretended to be her friend to lure her into tricks.\n\nInto her teenage years, Rose got Ethan's jacket from Chris, but continued to experience bullying by other students at high school. Mia herself no longer had a regular presence in her life, and Rose was instead protected by federal agents. Rose was at this point suffering from low self-esteem and an intense revulsion of herself and her nature, describing herself as \"hardly even human\". She asking herself how her father was, only thing she knew is he sacrificed his life for her. Her bodyguards would make regular jokes about her being \"Eveline\", in mockery of her similarity to another Superhuman who was linked to hundreds of deaths in Louisiana in 2017. Rose was at the time unfamiliar with the name. By the age of 16, her abilities were becoming of interest as an asset, with the federal government and Redfield taking interest in recruiting her, though Rose declines the invitation due to the work that she witnesses Redfield putting his Hound Wolf Squad through.\n\nIn 2037 Rose became the target of a plot by the Black God, which had survived in a greatly reduced state, with one sample being preserved in a lab in the US for closer observation. Due to her proximity to the lab, Rose became susceptible to its quorum sensing abilities, something which the archived copy of Miranda took advantage of in the hopes of finally completing her plans to turn Rose into a vessel. One day, Rose experienced an hallucination where she was asked by Charlie Graham to meet her at a park; during a conversation with the apparition, she was lured over to the lab and encouraged to directly handle the Black God, which the imposter Wilson suggested would allow her to render her powers inert and live as though an ordinary human.\n\nRose's interaction with the Black God allowed her to mentally connect with its stored memories, which manifested as the \"Realm of Consciousness\". The Realm was a distorted landscape made from scattered memories of the village and consisted of three layers, with the upper layer most similar to the physical world and the lower layer the more chaotic; the Purifying Crystal deep within Black God which could be used to weaken Rose's powers was located within the bottom layer.\n\nShe continues deeper to find herself end up in the warped distortion of Castle Dimitrescu along with various clones of herself being trapped and violently murdered by Face Eaters. During her journey, Rose encounters an entity emitting golden dust which guides and helps her along the path with Rose naming it Michael after the archangel Michael, Michael tries to persuade Rose into leaving the realm due to the dangers that it presides over but she insists in continuing with her objective with Michael relents into helping her. Afterwards, Rose stumbles onto The Masked Duke which takes the form after The Duke and spots the crystal trapped behind an mechanism but accidentally exposes herself to The Masked Duke who chases after her with numerous Face Eaters with Michael intervening to help once again. Acquiring all the pieces necessary, Rose retrieves the crystal only for The Masked Duke to reveal that it had been an replica with the crystal crumbling immediately much to her shock and despair. The latter abducts her to an underground arena where she is forced to fend off against the brute monster and Face Eaters. After killing the Executioner, The Masked Duke angrily seeks to surround, trap and kill her but Michael manages to direct Rose an way out where she jumps into the next stratum.\n\nRose eventually finds herself on the gardens of House Beneviento where Michael warns her that the further she goes, the harder it is to escape from the current stratum and tries to persuade her once again to leave but due to Rose's stubbornness and her strong desire of living an normal life, Michael willingly agrees to continue helping her. Upon entering inside the house, Michael is forced away due to another entity's intervention with Rose finding the inside of the house decorated just for her only. Rose is forced to solve puzzles in relation to her childhood trauma by the voice of an young girl who claims to know the location of the crystal and is willing to help her. The girl asks Rose to take the elevator to her which she races back only to get relentlessly chased by multiple mannequins of her mother. Rose manages to get inside the elevator and get send to an larger version of the house with multiple dolls actively seeking her out, Rose eludes her way to the bedroom where Eveline had asked her to meet only for her and her father to be ridiculed and laughed at by larger dolls, reigniting her traumatic memories at school.\n\nUnable to handle it anymore, Rose flees and eventually encounters Michael, who intervenes and saves her once again. Following the aftermath, Rose expresses that she does not know anything about her father besides the fact that he had died in protecting her, and conveys her desire of wanting to know more about him which Michael agrees to. The entity transports Rose to her childhood home filled with memories and voices of her dad on the day of her half-birthday 16 years ago, Rose finds her dad's letter addressed to her on her birthday in which she finds emotional comfort in.\n\nSuddenly, the young girl - revealed to be Eveline - traps her out of jealousy and sends her back to House Beneviento. Eveline reveals that the crystal is not on this stratum but on an much deeper one and proceeds to destroy the house in order to kill her. She expresses her envy over Mia's love for Rose instead of herself and the fact that Rose had a loving family as opposed to her. She had hoped that both Ethan and Mia died so they could be reunited as a family in death. During Rose's escape, Eveline manages to catch her but Michael deters her away, with Rose managing to learn of Eveline's identity through the entity. Still within Eveline's grasp, Michael urges Rose to use her power and suppress Eveline's abilities. Her weakened form would allow Michael to bring himself and Rose to safety. Rose confronts Eveline and successfully uses her abilities in suppressing and weakening her, with Michael managing to defeat her. Eveline cries and despairs over the thought that no one is able to love her because of her low self-worth. Rose approaches Eveline but is thrown off and is about to get killed until a man's shadow manages to push Rose off to safety and into the next stratum. He urges her to find the crystal.\n\nRose awakens and finds herself on the grounds of the Village. Realizing that the man has the same voice as her father, Rose comes to the conclusion that her guardian angel Michael had been her father Ethan. Finding new sense of determination, Rose continues in finding the crystal and tracks it down to the cave where the core root had been given birth to copies of Rose in hopes of finding the perfect vessel but the results were not ideal due to multiple factors, Rose also finds traces of someone who had been conducting researches inside the cave recently and finds out that The Masked Duke was created as a form of stress test as well as their acknowledgement of Eveline being the intruder to the realm. Rose continues deeper inside and eventually senses the strong aura that the Purifying Crystal gave out. She manages to acquire the crystal and her powers leave her body.\n\nShortly after, Miranda appears before her and explains that she cannot directly subdue her due to her powers and needed to relinquish it willingly in the form of K. She reveals that their conversation at the park and the lab have been an illusion that lured her deep within the Realm of Consciousness to become the vessel for Miranda's daughter, Eva. Miranda prepares to attack her until Ethan intervenes and they both escape - until Miranda intercepts once again. She incapacitates Ethan, who urges Rose to leave him and live her life normally. Unable to abandon her father, and finally embracing her identity as a superhuman, Rose breaks the Purifying Crystal, reabsorbs all of her abilities, and begins to fight Miranda. When Miranda proves too much to handle, Ethan gives his power to Rose. Her new strength quickly brings down Miranda, finally destroying her consciousness within the realm.\n\nRose and Ethan share one last moment together before she reawakens back in the lab, and finds Ethan's wedding ring in her hand. She gratefully cries, content with the experience.\n\nSometime, following her experience inside Realm of Consciousness, Rose decided to join Chris's operation and had undergone a multitude of tests. She later takes a Village of Shadows book and flowers, wearing Ethan's wedding ring, and jumps on a bus bound for the cemetery where her father's grave was located. She places flowers on his gravestone to mark his birthday. As she spends time talking to her father with love, an agent that was a part of her security detail arrived after a brief search for her, having foreseen that she would be at the cemetery given the occasion. He tells her that she is needed while mockingly referring to her as \"Eveline\". Enraged at the mention of the name, Rose grabs the agent by his tie and threatens to harm him in ways that even Chris wasn't aware of.\n\nAs Rose storms into the car, a nearby sniper was awaiting orders. The agent orders the sniper to stand down, stating he could handle Rose and she's \"just a kid\". Rose scolds herself for the outburst, but the agent affirms that she's just like her father, a statement she proudly acknowledges. Before they fully drive away from the cemetery, an unknown figure is seen approaching their vehicle.",

            "content": "Captain Christopher \"Chris\" Redfield is one of the main protagonists of the Resident Evil franchise. He is a former member of the S.T.A.R.S. unit. He's now a member of the Northern American team BSAA (Bioterrorism Security Assessment Alliance), an anti-BioTerrorist group tasked with stopping bioterrorism around the globe. He is the older brother of Claire Redfield and the partner of Jill Valentine.\n\nHis muscular size has changed throughout the series, starting out as a average sized person and ten years later, he is seen as a big brute. In Resident Evil 6, he becomes more of a tragic hero, as a result of losing his men to a bio-terrorist, whom he believes is Ada Wong. He relentlessly pursues her to kill her, but gives up on his vengeance to save the world from the virus. Redfield then returns to his role in the BSAAA, and later works with Blue Umbrella to stop the infection in Dulvey Parish, Louisiana. After dealing with the infection in Dulvey, Redfield became obsessed with stopping Mother Miranda, a biologist and cultist who wanted to Ethan and Mia Winter's daughter, Rose to bring back her late daughter.\n\nChris is close to his friends and family, specifically with his younger sister Claire and his partner Jill Valentine, whom he would both willingly give his life to protect. He also establishes bonds with the people he works with or their respect (Rebecca and Wesker for example) or admiration. He cares greatly for the life of innocents, something that caused him to argue with his superiors in the military.\n\nChris has a long-standing friendship with Barry Burton, who was an old friend of Chris' family. Barry was the one who recruited him for the Special Tactics And Rescue Service after Chris left the Air Force and began drifting.\n\nServing as Point Man in S.T.A.R.S. Alpha Team, Chris earned the trust of his comrades. In particular, Chris developed a close friendship with Jill Valentine, the only female member of S.T.A.R.S. at the time. Forest Speyer, the sharpshooter of the Bravo Team, was once a great friend (and rival) of Chris, until the Mansion Incident, where Forest was brutally killed and turned into a zombie.\n\nAfter the Mansion Incident, Chris became obsessed with the Umbrella Corporation, seeking information to bring the company down and avenge the deaths of his friends. Later, Chris and Jill formed a deadly alliance to fight Umbrella together, the BSAA\n\nFormerly, during his activity in S.T.A.R.S., Chris exhibited a great respect for the team's leader, Albert Wesker, who also considered Chris as his best team member. However, since Chris ruined, or at least delayed Wesker's plans at the mansion, a powerful grudge formed between them. Their confrontations thereafter were always intense and violent.\n\nHowever, during the Il Veltro incident, Chris was shown as a generic typical \"soldier\", focusing only on the mission and ignoring all of Jessica, his partner's advances. When asked by her whether he trusted her or not, he remarked \"Trust is measured by actions not words\" which Jessica replies \"That's so like you Chris. It's always about the job, isn't it?\" He also has a level of professionalism; he never once berated Jessica for her flirting and just focused on the mission. However, when Jill was in danger, he quickly switched focus completely onto rescuing her.\n\nDuring a BSAA mission to capture Oswell E. Spencer, Jill sacrificed herself to save Chris from Wesker, while he could do nothing to protect Jill. Jill's perceived death was a very serious blow to Chris personally. Ever since that encounter, he became distant and cold-hearted. It also psychologically scarred him such as when Wesker opened the bomber door and Sheva was almost pulled out to her death, he had a flashback to Jill's death and how he was unable to do anything and almost didn't grab Sheva's hand to save her.\n\nIn RE5 proper, Chris is initially shows a cold acceptance towards most of the grisly circumstances presented in the mission and shows little concern for its location or who he'll be working with. Immediately after meeting Sheva, she asks him if he'd \"rather be in America than in a place like this\". Chris dismisses the notion, noting that America \"has its own dark side\". She notes his lack of patriotism, and Chris merely states that he's a realist, noting that America is \"a capitalist society\" and that \"not everyone is cut out for that kind of pressure\". He considers that there are opportunities to be had, but as far as he sees it, \"at a price\". \"If you gain, someone else loses,\" He concludes. When Sheva says that he doesn't sound like any American that she's ever met, he points out that the great thing about Americans is that \"we're all different\".\n\nFollowing the battle with the first Uroboros B.O.W. he and Sheva encountered, Chris comments that if they had arrived sooner to assist DeChant and the rest of Delta Team, they would most likely be dead as well. A substantial part of his driving force during this time is seeking out Jill after he receives intel. That she may still be alive. Sheva has doubts about his \"personal stake\" in the mission, but later appreciates how much he cares for his old partner. With this, Sheva developed a close bond to Chris, decided to stay fighting alongside him in order to help him save Jill and take down Wesker.",

            "constant": false,
            "content": "The Duke is a mysterious character who serves as a merchant and aids Ethan Winters in Resident Evil Village. He has been the resident merchant of the village for years, profiting well from his business transactions. He becomes an important guide in Ethan's journey to rescue his daughter Rosemary.\n\n\nThe Duke was the village's resident merchant for years. He is an obese person with a jolly personality, his Emporium littered with supplies and bedecked with garlic to fend off vampiric monsters. His motives are often purely profit-driven, as he is willing to do business with anyone in the village, including Lady Alcina Dimitrescu, as he had a station inside her castle. Despite this, he has occasionally granted favors to several villagers; he brought old newspapers to Ernest upon request so that he could read about goings-on of the outside world, despite it being forbidden by Mother Miranda. He also seems to know the Merchant.\n\nAs the game's merchant, he sells Ethan weapons, supplies, upgrades, and blueprints to craft supplies on the go. He will also buy valuable treasures from Ethan for Lei, and provide boosts by preparing special dishes from meat, poultry, and seafood Ethan brings him.\n\nDespite his human façade, he seems to have an omnipresent, omniscient, and immortal nature. He is able to move his cart around quite quickly, and is conveniently present in several locations whenever Ethan needs him. He has extensive knowledge of the village and its history, as well as the true nature and plans of Mother Miranda and the Lords despite not being physically present. He supplies valuable information integral to Ethan's journey, and serves as something of a guide to him. He is also unaffected if Ethan fires weapons or attacks him in any way.\n\nAfter the village is attacked by Lycans, he becomes Ethan's aide. He meets Ethan in front of Castle Dimitrescu after the latter escapes traps set by Karl Heisenberg, though he already seems to know who Ethan is, and that he is there to rescue his daughter. When asked about this by Ethan, he says, \"Anyone who is anyone has heard of the likes of you.\" Ethan finds the Duke again inside the castle, where the Duke merely says he is there if there's \"coin to be made.\" He suggests to Ethan that if Rosemary is inside the castle, then she might be in Lady Dimitrescu's private chambers. Upon returning to the Duke's station, Ethan tells him that Rosemary is not in the castle; the Duke then apologizes for the poor turn of events.\n\nAfter Ethan kills Dimitrescu, he reunites with the Duke at the village's altar. The Duke reveals that the glass flask he possesses contains the head of Rosemary, shocking Ethan, who lashes out at him. The Duke assures him that Rosemary's essence is still intact and she can be saved, but he must first retrieve something in a house with a red chimney. The Duke also tells Ethan that he has no other options, and it is his choice to trust him or not. Ethan retrieves the Winged Unborn Key, which the Duke says can be used to access the locations of the Four Lords to retrieve the flasks containing Rosemary. The Duke explains the Four Lords to Ethan, and places their locations on his map. When Ethan asks why he is so eager to help him, the Duke says that it is part of his \"first-class customer service\", and from then on, the Duke's Emporium is based at the altar. He also opens his Kitchen to cook and serve food from ingredients Ethan provides. As revealed in Ethan's diary, he is shown to not trust the Duke, despite the latter helping him.\n\nWhen Ethan arrives at Moreau's Reservoir, the Duke is located at the washed up control tower which powers the dam.\n\nWhen Ethan enters Heisenberg's Factory, the Duke once again sets up his Emporium at the factory's elevator, where he says he has expanded his services. No matter what floor Ethan brings him to, the Duke seems completely unfazed, and spends his time in the factory reading a book.\n\nAfter Ethan's heart is ripped out by Mother Miranda, the Duke rescues him and places him in the back of his carriage while he recuperates, having been drawn to the location by watching his battle with Heisenberg. Knowing Ethan would need to finish the job, the Duke brings him to Miranda's location. The Duke asks him if he should continue his quest, considering that his body is dying; when Ethan affirms, the Duke says it was foolish of him to ask. Ethan then asks him about his true nature, to which he replies, \"Even I can't quite answer that\". Upon arriving at Miranda's site, the Duke cautions Ethan that he cannot return to his old life anymore due to his condition, but Ethan assures that he is ready. As Ethan purchases from his Emporium one last time, the Duke laments that the village, his territory of business, has been destroyed due to Miranda's actions. He bids Ethan farewell before Ethan faces Miranda.\n\nAfter Ethan sacrificed himself and blew up the entire village, it is unknown if the Duke survived and made it out of the village, though it is possible, given his brisk movement.\n\nA copy of the Duke called the Masked Duke was created by the consciousness of Miranda for the purpose of finding a worthy vessel for her daughter Eva in Duplicated copies of Rosemary Winters. According to his diary, upon his creation, his memories were broken as he doesn't remember his own identity as well as on how he came into existence. All that he knows is that he himself is sadistic in personality, taking a liking of seeing the suffering of others. Miranda tasked him with invoking such great terrors into the Rose Copies in order to pressure them into expressing similar aspects of Rose's powers. The Masked Duke is shown to command a species of monster called Face Eaters in trying to test the duplicates and will have them killed/imprisoned if they strayed too far.\n\nUpon noticing the real Rosemary, he commanded the Face Eaters to pursue her. Throughout Castle Dimitrescu, he would taunt Rose through televisions and voice intercoms as she ventures to retrieve the Purifying Crystal, which could cleanse her off her powers. At the same time, he will send in hordes of Face Eaters as well as large brutal monster called the Executioner. After Rose was captured and placed in a cell in the castle dungeons, the Masked Duke forced her to go through an impossible challenge in order to survive. Though she succeeded in the first part, the challenge soon became more complicated. However, thanks to Michael's guidance, Rose managed to survive and escape.\n\nLater, when she finally retrieves the Purifying Crystal, the Masked Duke appeared behind her and revealed that the crystal she had gotten is merely a replica. However, it turns out, the Masked Duke had baited her into a trap and she fell for it. Taking her to an unknown part of the castle's lower levels, he forced Rose to fight against the Executioner. When it failed to kill Rose, the Masked Duke was furious over its failure, calling it a \"useless\" creature and a \"disappointment\". He then brings forth several puddles of liquid mold along with his best face-eaters, in an attempt to kill Rose himself, but she was able to escape, thanks to Michael's guidance. What became of the Masked Duke is unknown as he is not seen again afterwards.",

By Monday 8 February, much of the village had been destroyed, though Stan held out, armed with several firearms and in hiding. In the early hours of Tuesday, Ethan Winters trespassed. An outsider with no familiarity with the Lycans, he was unprepared in defending the house.

            "content": "The lycans are a mutant human species whom are noted for their canine-like characteristics resulting from an outbreak of Mold in Eastern Europe and the infestation of the Cadou parasite. From 1919 to 2021 they had carved out their territory in an isolated mountain village, where they preyed upon other humans. Lycan are believed extinct following the region's destruction by the Fungal Root.\n\nLycan are the result of a human being implanted with Cadou, a parasitic nematode genetically modified by the Mold. Originally these people were failed test-subjects for a superhuman project intent on finding a suitable host body for the copied Eva consciousness, with Lycan being the result of the host and parasite rejecting one another due to the host's low affinity.\n\nThese mutants were then cast out of the village by Miranda in order to keep the remaining townsfolk alive for future research. They then made their den in the ruins of a medieval fort, and were treated more akin to foxes, only occasionally raiding the village to kill livestock. Though there have been cases of people in 2021 becoming Lycan after being injured, it is uncertain if Lycan are capable of infecting people or if they had already been injected with Cadou eggs.\n\nIn terms of intelligence, Lycan are close to normal humans in that they are capable of expertly handling weapons such as bows, ride horses, and are seen to occasionally wear crude armor. Lycans are also social creatures, and thus they hunt in packs and have a strong hierarchy where the larger Lycan appear to take a leadership role, being Uriaș, the biggest Lycan, at the top as expected, though this may be only on a pragmatic basis.\n\nThey are extremely aggressive and will attack their designated target they hunt on sight, except while stalking their prey. While Lycan do prey on humans, they typically consume them after some time has passed. Lycan are known to hang their prey by rope for later consumption, usually while grabbing onto the corpse. They are not picky eaters however, preying on nearly anything, including livestock, birds and fish.\n\nIn terms of physical appearance and strength, Lycan are considerably stronger than normal humans and their distorted jaws give stronger biting force, powerful enough to easily sever limbs of their victims. They are also more agile and durable, able to taking and enduring multiple gunshot and stab wounds before finally going down and succumbing to death.",

            "content": "Uriaș was a powerful troll-esque Lycan who served as an enforcer for Mother Miranda. Originally the chief of an East European mountain community, he was infected with the Cadou parasite and transformed into a monster, along with most of the other villagers. Uriaș Străjer is his older brother.\n\nHis name is derived from the Romanian word \"uriaș\", which means \"huge\" or \"giant\".\n\nUpon discovering the Fungal Root inside a cavern, Miranda extracted its mold and used it to experiment on local villagers. In doing so, she hoped to find a suitable vessel to revive her long-dead daughter, Eva. These experiments gave birth to the Cadou parasite. Those rejected by the Cadou were all transformed into Lycans, including Uriaș.\n\nUnlike the other Lycans, Uriaș' size and strength increased dramatically upon infection. This allowed him to wield a large war-hammer, jump incredible distances, and toss columns with ease. Despite his size, he possessed superhuman agility, although he wasn't quite as fast as normal Lycans.\n\nUriaș is first encountered by Ethan during the initial Lycan assault at the beginning of the game. As a brute-type enemy, his attacks inflict considerably more damage than that of ordinary Lycans. He will mostly pursue the player while furiously swinging his war-hammer. If the player manages to kill Uriaș at this stage, he will drop 35,000 lei and a crystal skull.\n\nIrrespective of whether or not the player kills Uriaș, he will still appear as a mini-boss in the Stronghold section. His attacks are mostly the same, although now he can pick up and toss nearby columns at Ethan. When defeated, he will drop a crystal war hammer.",

On the way, her father was attacked by Lycans and lost a lot of blood. They take shelter in a nearby hut, when they encounter Ethan Winters, who is searching for his missing daughter, Rosemary Winters. When Ethan steps inside the hut, Elena pleads with him to quickly close the door. She is initially distrustful of him and begs him not to hurt her or her father. After Ethan reassures them that he is here to help, he manages to open the front gate where Elena hurriedly carries Leonardo to the house. Leonardo then chastises Ethan for \"taking his time\". Elena apologizes, claiming that her father is not used to relying on other people.\n\nElena bangs on the front door, pleading with Luiza to let them in, but she is however met the cautious shotgun wielding Iulian. She pleads with him to take her father inside but Iulian refuses to let them in, saying how his blood could attract the monsters. Luiza finally comes out, letting them in as \"their friends\".\n\nAt the gathering, Elena asks Luiza where her husband is to which she replies that he is out there getting help. Suddenly Leonardo starts to roar in pain and kills everyone in the building except for her and Ethan. Her father starts to pound on Ethan and prepares to kill him until Elena steps in and shoots her father with a shotgun. She is instantly remorseful, and Ethan tells her that he wasn't her father anymore and that she did the right thing. The two run for the garage and lock the door behind them.\n\nElena and Ethan manage to reach the attic by the use of a truck. Ethan points to a window as their way out, but Elena asks what will they do after they escape since the village is still full of monsters and that they can't fight them. Ethan reassures her that they will find a safehouse to put her in until he can find Rose. Ethan is sure that Rose is in the castle seen in the near distance, however Elena remarks that the castle is \"full of nothing but blood and death\". Leonardo then climbs through the attic much to her surprise. He calls out her name in pain and Elena quickly runs for him when the wooden planks collapses, separating her and Ethan. Ethan tries to tell her to grab his hand but Elena tells him to go and save his daughter. The planks supporting the two villagers eventually gives out, sending Elena and her father to the fiery depths below.",

However, once most of the village residents were either slaughtered or transformed into mutants and Lycans, she turned her house into a sanctuary for survivors. At some point, her husband left the sanctuary to get help, but the two were never able to see each other alive again.\n\nWhen Ethan Winters, Leonardo and Elena arrived at her house, she welcomed her two village neighbors in. Though initially wary of Ethan, she decides to trust him as Elena does. Luiza told Ethan to wait in her lobby while she checks on the others, then invites him into her dining room to take a seat with them.\n\nWhen Ethan asks if this is all remains of the Village, the drunken Anton cruelly insults the other survivors and Luiza herself, upset that she brought in a dying man and an outsider. She rebukes his drunken ranting, telling him that her house has been protecting her family for generations and that all are welcome and safe in there. Ethan questions Luiza, but she says she has no idea what is happening in the village, only that monsters suddenly attacked. Elena asks her where her husband went, to which she answers that he went outside to get help. She then brings the group together to say a prayer for his safety.\n\nLeonardo begins to act strange, collapsing in pain and starting a fire after knocking over a lantern. Luiza tries to help him but Leonardo hacks her in the shoulder with his machete, fatally injuring her as she bleeds to death. The infected Leonardo starts a murderous rampage, eliminating all that remains of the village.\n\nThe fire eventually spreads to the rest of the house, destroying the only safe haven left for survivors of the Lycan attacks. The bodies of Luiza and the rest of the survivors are consumed by the flames as Ethan escapes, only leaving behind the crest in her courtyard and her treasured necklace in the ruins.",

Luiza responds that her house has been protecting her family for generations and that all are welcome and safe in there, even him, but he just dismisses this and walks away, continuing to drink.\n\nWhen Leonardo starts to roar in pain, he throws the lantern to the ground, which starts the fire, Anton desperately tries to put out the flames. When Leonardo kills Luiza, Anton smashes the bottle over his head but is overwhelmed and burned alive by the spreading fire.[2]",

Notes found in the dungeons they now populate indicate Alcina may have been trying to create more daughters, though they all turned out to be failures. Infected with the Mold, they were revived as hollow husks of their former selves, lacking the intelligence they once possessed when they were mortal, and now seek only to feed on those around them. Thus, the Moroaică have the appearance of deformed walking corpses, with pallid skin lacking pigmentation, disfigured bat-like faces, and layers of sharp needle-like fangs they use to puncture the throats of their victims, draining them of their blood. Their fingers and toes are also elongated, giving them the appearance of claws, and they walk with a shambling gait, weakened by their lack of sustenance and the abuse they've suffered, before and after death, at Castle Dimitrescu.\n\nMoroaică are for the most part slow and clumsy, Moroaică can attack people in many ways such as; claws, mouths, and they are often seen carrying swords.

Sometime later, he and other members of the team arrived at Miranda's overturned convoy to find the escorts killed and Ethan and Rose missing.\n\nGraham and his unit arrived at the crash site at 11:35 AM without finding Ethan and Rose. At 12:10 PM, they infiltrated the Village and engaged with a variety of bioweapons. They found evidence of Ethan being in the Village but Rose's location remained unknown. At 13:10 PM, they established a base in the church and planned an operation with in which Graham, Emily Berkhoff, and John Perlman would search a laboratory nearby while the other two members of Hound Wolf Squad would analyze mold samples. Their captain Chris Redfield was tasked with heading to Heisenberg's Factory.\n\nGraham and the others then set up at a research post somewhere in the Reservoir outside of the village to monitor the situation and examine the Mold around the Village. Graham and his teammates were attacked by the mutated fish creature that Moreau had become, but all of them made it out alive.

Both Chris and Graham played a great role in her care and upbringing.\n\nIn 2037, Miranda, who had survived as a disembodied consciousness for sixteen years in a fragment of the Megamycete, took advantage of Rose's connection to Graham when Rose came into close proximity with the surviving piece of the Fungal Root and was exposed to its quorum sensing abilities. In this disguise, Miranda was able to lure Rosemary Winters into coming into the Realm Of Consciousness willingly by exploiting her desire to live a normal life free of powers that she had inherited from her parents Ethan and Mia Winters. Miranda, as Graham, offered Rose the means to relinquish her abilities, but this offer was merely one last ruse by Miranda.",

She was the daughter of Miranda.\n\nEva was the daughter of Miranda. At some time during the Spanish flu pandemic, she caught the virus and eventually succumbed to it. Miranda would later go mad with grief over Eva's death and eventually attempt suicide by exposure to the elements, which would lead to Miranda's discovery of the Mold. Realizing that the Mold's Fungal Root can maintain the consciousness of anyone, Miranda theorized she could revive Eva through finding a suitable host, leading her to include Eva's DNA in the Fungal Root and to manipulate the villagers in partaking in her experiments in finding Eva's possible host. Years of failed experiments led to several mutated monsters that would later ravage the village.\n\nRoughly a century after her death, a sample of Eva's DNA was sent to The Connections by Miranda alongside a sample of Mold, and was used to create the bioweapon Eveline. However, Miranda saw this as a failure, as Eveline's unhealthy obsession with having a family caused her to act extremely violently.\n\nYears later, Miranda would gain knowledge of the existence of Ethan Winters' daughter Rosemary, who was born from two Mold-mutated parents. Feeling that Rose was her best chance at being Eva's host, she had her kidnapped and dismantled in order to revive her in a ceremony merging her with the Fungal Root's consciousness. Although the ceremony proceeded as planned, Miranda's plan ultimately failed as Rosemary was revived instead of Eva. Enraged by the events, losing her powers, and despondent over failing to revive Eva, she decided that she would become Rosemary's new mother instead. She attacked Winters who had arrived to get his daughter back. Her plan was thwarted by the combined efforts of Winters and Chris Redfield, and she was killed in the destruction of the village.",

            "content": "The E-001, also known as \"Eveline\" was a bioweapon which took the form of a young girl and the main antagonist of the 2017 survival horror video game Resident Evil 7: Biohazard, as well as the secondary antagonist of its sequel Resident Evil Village's story DLC, Shadows of Rose.\n\nAppearing as a young girl, Eveline used this as a way to invade the Baker Home and take control of them, with the family seeing her as a lost child. Her second form is an old comatose woman, which she uses to spy on people. However, her true form is a giant snake-like creature made entirely form fungus and Mold.\n\nShe was a B.O.W created by Mother Miranda and The Connections, created by Miranda to use as a vessel to revive her daughter Eva. The attempt failed due to Eveline's unhealthy obsession with having a family and wanting to be loved and cared for, being neglected by the people experimenting on her, causing her to act violently and unstable. To this end, after she destroyed the ship, she was being transported on, she rewarded her rescuer Jack Baker by infecting him and his family with her mold powers. She then used her surrogate mother Mia to write the letter that lured her husband and main protagonist, Ethan Winters, to Dulvey to force him into becoming her father.\n\nEveline was ultimately killed by Ethan using a gun loaded with anti-toxen with the help of BSAA, though some piece of her remained in Ethan's psyche due to his connection with the mold. Her consciousness preserved within a fragment of the Black God supercolony would later face off against Ethan's daughter Rose, although Rose would escape with the help of Ethan himself, whose consciousness had survived within the Black God.\n\nE-001, codenamed Eveline, was created by NEXBAS (Next-generation EXperimental BAttlefield Superiority) Initiative done by H.C.F. (Hive-Host Capture Force) and Tentsu members to function as a bioweapon capable of psychically manipulating infected people with a fungus called Mold, when the degree of the contamination was high enough as well as turning her subjects into new B.O.W.s called \"Molded\". The Mold itself was a modified strain of the original one in possession of Spencer's former mentor Mother Miranda. It's later revealed that Eveline was also created with the DNA of Miranda's daughter, Eva, but the mother wouldn't see Eveline to be the perfect vessel to resurrect her late child.\n\nIn spite of a breakthrough in her creation, she had to be periodically injected with a special serum that kept her powers and sanity under control. Was she not injected with said serum, her Mold fungus inside her would accelerate her aging, corrupt her mind and turn her into another Molded.\n\nThree years prior to the events of the game, Eveline was transported to a different facility on a ship under the watch of two caretakers, Alan and Mia due to attempt sabotages by agents from the arms industries as her existence would render conventional arms sale worthless. However, she managed to escape and began spreading her infection all over the ship, killing or turning all of the passengers and crew members into Molded. How her rampage started was due to during the transport, a hurricane approached the ship and at the same time, a group of people from a rival company attacks.\n\nTo make matters worse, the attack took place the wrong time as during the said attack, Eveline's powers became unstable and with her creators being occupied by the attack, she spread her fungus out of control, first infecting Alan and then running away and vomiting excessive amounts of Mold before turning everyone on board into Molded. Eveline finally killed Alan in front of Mia before infecting her with the Mold in the hopes of turning Mia into a mother figure. She and Mia escaped from the ship as a number of explosions occurred.\n\nAfterwards, Eveline and Mia were found by the Baker family, who took them in and nursed them back to health. Without the regular injections of the serum however, Eveline began to age rapidly, taking the form of an old woman. She infected the Baker family with her mutation-inducing powers, contaminating their food, turning them nearly immortal and influencing them to kidnap people and turn them into Molded.\n\nDLC of the game, \"Daughters\", revealed how chaotic the situation where Eveline instigated the infection. Overhearing Jack's decision to call for help after led both Mia and Eveline to stay, Eveline, who fed up with people who may be similar to her caretakers, become mad so much that she instigated the whole family's infections starting Marguerite. When Marguerite suddenly attacked Zoe due to infection, Jack goes to stop her, but ultimately succumbed to the infection as much as his wife and Lucas, with Zoe being the least infected.\n\nEthan pursues Eveline into a salt mine and is attacked by dozens of Molded sent by Eveline. However, he manages to defeat the Molded and later, uses machines left by NEXBAS Initiative members behind to create E-Necrotoxin, more potent version of Mold cure from Eveline's DNA before pursues her into the guest house visited at the beginning of the game. Ethan is attacked by hallucinations of Mia but manages to reach Eveline and injects her with E-Necrotoxin.\n\nEveline's disguise is revealed as the seemingly comatose woman in a wheelchair who mysteriously follows Ethan for most of the game. The serum does not immediately kill her but give horrific side effect: It dissolves her into a puddle of black liquid, triggering her uncontrollable transformation into her true form, a giant tree-like creature made from mold with a giant mutated face.\n\nEveline throws Ethan through the roof of the house and sends him flying into the floor. She arises from the home and attacks him, stabbing him through the leg and lifting him in the air and dropping him again, however a helicopter drops a pistol at the same time Eveline drops Ethan. He crawls towards it and grabs the gun, before shooting Eveline five times in the head. The bullets explode into clouds of anti-toxen as they hit her, sending Eveline recoiling back into the air. She let's out an enraged roar before collapsing to the ground, calcifying and dying.\n\nFollowing her death, Eveline's Mold creations are left to their own devices and without her guiding them, they are all quickly dispatched by BSAA agent Chris Redfield and Blue Umbrella operatives. However, the clean-up progress is by no means easy, as not only Jack Baker's surviving infected remains eventually regenerates into a resilient Molded which eventually destroyed by his estranged brother Joe and Lukas turned out experimented with a couple of them after being cured by The Connections in return of becoming their associate.\n\nEveline's influence remains in Ethan's daughter Rosemary Winters. The cult known as the Four Houses led by Mother Miranda plotting to take Rose and use her as a vessel to revive Miranda's late daughter, Eva.\n\nHowever, it didn't work, and Miranda became weakened. In Ethan's temporarily death, he saw the hallucinated Eveline when she revealed he was also molded after he was killed by Jack Baker. Ethan was later revived from his seemingly death and used whatever strength left in him to kill Mother Miranda and successfully rescued Rose before he sacrifices himself to kill Mother Miranda and destroy the Megamycete completely.\n\nTen years after both Ethan and Mother Miranda's deaths, Rose became strong under Chris' care promised by her late father. An agent jokingly referred Rose as Eveline when he offends her.\n\nAlmost 20 years after her battle with Ethan at the Baker Ranch in 2017, Eveline would resurface as an enemy of the Winters family in 2036. Although her physical body had long since died by this time, Eveline's mind survived within the consciousness of the Black God, itself preserved due to a small portion of it surviving Ethan's sacrifice. When Rose melded her consciousness with that of the Black God in an attempt to locate the purifying crystal to remove the mold and its abilities from her body, she ended up encountering Eveline's consciousness. Eveline relentlessly attacked and tormented Rose out of jealousy that Rose's parents loved Rose and not Eveline, while Rose used her latent powers to fight back and resist Eveline. Eveline forced Rose through a series of twisted and demented challenges before Rose finally escaped her with the help of the entity she knew as \"Michael\", who would turn out to be her father Ethan's consciousness that had been preserved by the Black God.\n\nEveline is shown to have a bloodthirsty and homicidal nature but is not aware of the evil she commits. She is best described as a severely disturbed and traumatized young girl who abused her powers to infect the peaceful Baker family, making them into her vicious servants. Despite Eveline's actions and playfully sadistic attitude, they and her obsession with family seem to have been brought on by her orphaned upbringing as a bioweapon, since she still acts like a child who wants to know what being loved by a family feels like and does not necessarily know what she is. This becomes apparent when Ethan tries to kill her with the antidote. She breaks into tears, wondering why nobody truly loves her and they always hated her.\n\nIn Shadows of Rose, Eveline shows a scathing hatred of Miranda, her creator and first mother figure. She keeps screaming and lashing out at Rose herself that \"[Miranda] only wants you\"; jealousily oblivious still that she is solely a bioweapon who was never intended to be loved. Eveline also shows shock at Ethan being around, due to the fact he killed her the first time; particularly the fact she was threatening his daughter didn't help.\n\nStill unable to understand that Mia and Ethan utterly despised her, Eveline is bratty as ever; believing she's entitled to have them. Eveline ends up projecting what everyone thinks about herself onto Rose; that she can't trust anyone (hence all the mind control issues), no-one loves her (since she's an unstable B.O.W.) and won't give a damn when she's dead.\n\nArtificial Human-Mold Hybrid Physiology: Befitting to her purpose as a mind-controlling B.O.W. and intended vessel of would-be revived Miranda's late daughter, Eveline was conceived by infecting a human embryo and bio-engineered fungoid called Mold and envisioned as a 10-year-old little girl so as to better blend into unsuspecting populace and enemy soldiers alike. This in turn, endows her the ability to produce and manipulate excess Mold at will, including creating a colony of fungoid to suit her needs and infecting the others through contact. Because she was conceived through scientific means which include genetic alterations to accelerate her growth at the cost of mental deterioration and insanity, Eveline must be given periodic medication to halt her rapid-aging and preventing her from making a wanton use of her powers.\n\nFungokinesis: As stated previously, Eveline could produce and manipulate excess Mold for variety of purposes where the fungoid could infect other lifeforms such as humans, animals, and plants through physical contact and possessed psychotropic effects she could influence to the boot.\nMind Control: Eveline primary fungokinesis ability was to enthrall and sway other beings via. the Mold infection. The utilized Mold formed a bond between her and Mold-infected individuals, causing the target to become highly suggestible to Eveline's will as well as addicted to follow her commands, allowing her to instruct them to do her bidding on ease such as mutilation, murder, and self-mutilation as shown in the case of Marguerite, Jack, and for a time, Lucas. Only individuals with strong willpower and least severe Mold infection that could resist her, however. This also allowed her to command Molded, sentient humanoid monsters shaped out of Mold colony with or without human corpses as sort of frame/basis.\nTelepathy: With the same Mold she used to infect her targets as the conduit, Eveline could communicate directly with Mold-infected individuals' minds.\nHallucination Inducement: Eveline could also use her Mold to create realistic hallucinations such as projections of herself that cannot be perceived by non-infected individuals, masking her true elderly form, causing them to see and hear things, and even seemingly teleport and perform telekinetic feats on ease. She used this ability to either properly communicate with Mold-infected individuals without the need of physically near them or simply drove them insane.\nMegamycete Creation: Throughout her rampage at Louisiana, Eveline left behind a Megamycete that infested the ship she previously contained within, which stored replicated consciousness and knowledge of those who infected by Mold she unleashed. It was through this not only Ethan who revived with her powers attained necessary knowledge to operate scattered weapons throughout the swampy region under her control, but also briefly reunited with deceased Bakers who apologized for their misdeeds while under Eveline's control.\nMold-Assisted Telekinesis (possibly): In addition of mind control, other implied feat Eveline could perform with her Mold was moving, manipulating, or otherwise interact with objects/matter without touching them. As opposed of being a psychic ability as shown in one of her illusions, Eveline infused things with her Mold in order to mentally manipulate them just as she needed to infect someone in order to influence them.\nMold Tower Form: With sufficient amount of produced Mold, Eveline could transform into a seemingly immobile, tentacled tower-like fungal abomination that capable of shrugging off attacks and crushing things on ease which sported her elderly form's face on top of it. She could assume this form in matter of seconds as sort of surprise attack as shown when ambushing Ethan and Mia/Zoe near the ship that used to transport her. The only way to kill her in this state is with use of more potent E-Necrotoxin.\nAccelerated Aging: As stated previously, Eveline's development included genetic alterations that resulted her to rapidly age around 24 times the normal human rate. This, coupled with mental degradation that came from it, could be prevented via. periodical medication. By the time Ethan finally saw her true form after injecting her with E-Necrotoxin, Eveline appeared to be an elderly woman despite only 3 years old before engaging him in her Mold tower form.",

            "content": "The Four Houses are the main antagonists of Resident Evil Village. They are a group of four ancient noble families that formed an alliance in ruling over a village in Eastern Europe. The alliance was eventually taken over by Mother Miranda, who became their ruler and mutated the latest descendants of the nobles as part of her experiments with the Megamycete.\n\nThe Four Houses descend from a group of mutants that ruled an underground city with the names Berengario, Cesare, Guglielmo and Nichola. Their current legacies are the Beneviento, Dimitrescu, Heisenberg and Moreau families. Sometime after the Spanish Flu, Mother Miranda came along and claimed herself to be a prophet of the \"Black God\", which as a powerful fungus. Mother Miranda experimented with the mold on many children, including that of the Four Houses. These were in an attempt to revive her fallen daughter. In the end, only Alcina Dimitrescu, Karl Heisenberg, Salvatore Moreau, and Donna Beneviento survived. None of them would be suitable to serve as a host body for Eva. From 1950 to 2021, Miranda's rule remained over them and thus over the region.\n\nCastle Dimitrescu is an old castle that is home to the Dimitrescu dynasty. Both the house and the dynasty revolve around themes of Vampires and bats. It inhabitants consist of Alcina Dimitrescu, Bela Dimitrescu, Cassandra Dimitrescu, Daniela Dimitrescu, and Mother Miranda. It is at this location where Miranda experiments on her victims. People fear this place because Alcina will often take in innocent townsfolk and use their blood to sustain herself. Alcina did not always live here, until she inherited the manner for herself.\n\nHouse Beneviento is an old mansion. It is inhabited by the secluded Donna Beneviento and her dolls, her most loyal being Angie. Over the years, this home's inhabitants became slimmer and slimmer as they were used as experiments by Mother Miranda. Eventually, Donna became it's only inhabitant, and inherited the doll-making business. In addition, she possesses chemicals that cause whoever falls victim to them to experience hallucinations.\n\nMoreau's Reservoir appears to be a collection of old broken down aquatic-related structures. This house is themed after fish and other marine life. Salvatore Moreau was the only inhabitant of his house. This house is located in an old fishing village. Moreau ended up building a dam so that the river would flood the town. This would allow for his body to move around it, and for him to consume nearby fisherman.\n\nHeinsenberg's factory is a massive factory that is located on the outskirts of a village in Eastern Europe. This house consists of industrialized weapons and gears that fit make up it's overall theme. Heisenberg is it's ruling inhabitant, the others being undead that were brought to life with Cabou parasites. Heisenberg ruled over this factory with an iron fist, planning to make a team of bio-engineered warriors to overthrow Mother Miranda.\n\nThe role of these characters in the game was to serve Mother Miranda in preforming a ceremony to help revive her former daughter Eva. They were going to do so by using the Ethan's daughter, Rose. They eventually kidnapped Ethan and it was decided that Heisenberg would decide his fate, but there was protest between him and Alcina. Each House held onto a flask pertaining to Rose, and Ethan had to visit each of them in order retrieve each individual flask. As he went to each house, he fought each of the heads, all of them (except for Donna) mutating into monstrous forms in an attempt to stop him. Despite their best efforts, they were unable to defeat him, and their legacies ended up coming to an end.\n\nDespite their alliance, the Houses all seemed to have a hostility toward each other. They see each other as less than colleagues but more as siblings. And Salvatore Moreau even refers to them as siblings.\n\nHouse Dimitrescu is the only one to have other members.",

It is possibly under the implicate authority of or a deadly illusion created by Donna Beneviento, hunting Ethan Winters throughout Donna's home.\n\nAs its name implies, the Baby shares many similar characteristics to that of a human infant. On top of sharing some similar physical qualities, this creature also speaks in a similar manner. Throughout its pursuit with Ethan, it will often say \"Mama\" and \"Dada\". Like most infants at a young age, the Baby will stick things that it shouldn't into its mouth, such as Ethan when he gets too close, and will utter \"Yummy\" while doing so.\n\nWhile in Donna's residence, Ethan fell victim to Donna's Mold-infected plants and begins to experience hallucinations. This most likely implies that the Baby is just an illusion. If this is the case, then it may represent Ethan's inner fears about his daughter Rosemary and what Mother Miranda and the Four Houses will do to her.\n\nWhile large and obviously superior to Ethan, the Baby's mutated form has made it hard for it to navigate its surroundings. It has a very hard time moving around the residence, bowing its head up and down each movement and dragging its entire body only with the support of its hands. It also doesn't seem to have very good senses other than sight, not being able to find Ethan hiding inside or under things.\n\nThe Baby looks less like a traditional human baby, and more akin to a malformed fetus. It has two large black beady eyes, a balding head, and a gigantic slobbering toothless mouth that stretches down its neck. Its skin is a mixture of tan and red, as though it had been born recently. Its main body is flat and facing the floor, and it walks on all fours, its hands doing most of the work as its feet are bent backward, similar to a grasshopper.\n\nWhile Ethan is trying to retrieve the Break-Box Key, the Baby will appear at the end of a hallway that leads to the Doll workshop. It will then begin its chase with Ethan, who will have to escape into the kitchen. Later, after Ethan obtains a fuse, the Baby will reappear and chase Ethan from the kitchen and the bedroom, only for him to escape it once reaching the Medicine room. The Baby won't be seen again until Ethan reaches the elevator. He will have to successfully close its gates before the Baby reaches him. Once he does, the Baby will scream at him as he escapes in the elevator.\n\nBased on the nature of the creature, it was most likely killed either when Beneviento was killed by Ethan or when Ethan destroyed the Megamycete.",

Having been laid off from the company, Bailey founded the Connections following Umbrella's downfall to continue his bio-chemical research in developing B.O.W.s.\n\nThe Connections would at some point come into contact with Mother Miranda, the woman who had once been a close mentor and friend to the Umbrella Corporation's founder Oswell E. Spencer. The Connections offered Miranda their help in her research to revive her daughter Eva in exchange for samples of the Mold and Eva's DNA. Miranda agreed and joined the Connections as one of their leading researchers.\n\nThe Connections collaborated with Hive-Host Capture Force, Albert Wesker's task force group in creating of a revolutionary fungus known as the \"Mold\". Using test subjects capable of mind control as their sole purpose of creating such bioweapons, they are given letter-based code names. The earliest A-Types suffered performance issues, however later models became more advanced than the precedessors. The latest model which is the E-Type is their most advanced model. A Necrotoxin was also created as a contigency plan to exterminate their bioweapons.\n\nAmong the living bioweapons developed by the Connections was Eveline, a genetically engineered human created in the image of Miranda's daughter using her DNA. Codenamed \"E-001\", Eveline was capable of controlling those infected with the Mold fungus and was intended to be the first in a series of child-like \"E-Type\" bioweapons that would revolutionize the way warfare was conducted.\n\nHowever, as Eveline was transported to a different facility on a ship under the watch of two caretakers, Alan Droney and Mia Minters, a violent hurricane struck the ship and enabled Eveline to escape. Eveline began spreading her infection all over the ship, killing or turning all of the passengers and crew members into Molded before it crashed, with Eveline and Mia being the only survivors\n\nAfterwards, Eveline and Mia were found and taken in by the Baker family, only for Eveline to contaminate the family and begin mutating them with her fungus. The Connections were able to locate Eveline and deciding to allow her to continue living with the Baker family. Setting up a lab in the Abercrombie Salt Mine, the Connections recruited the son of the family, Lucas Baker, to serve as a field agent for them and provide them with updates on Eveline's condition.",

            "content": "Castle Dimitrescu  is a large Mediæval castle owned by the Dimitrescu family and located in Eastern Europe.\n\nThe castle was built during the 15th century under the watchful eye of Cesare, a Duke, and was later inhabited by his descendants, the noble Dimitrescu family, who instigated a number of violent murders and mutilations against the local peasantry. It is uncertain what became of them in the centuries after, whether they left the village or their main branch became extinct, but by the mid-20th century ownership of the castle fell to Countess Alcina Dimitrescu, who was considered an outsider to the region. Continuing her family's legacy of maintaining a feudal and tyrannical rule over the village, the castle once more became associated with Sanguis Virginis, a brand of enriched red wine whose secret recipe dated back to winemaking techniques developed by the Dimitrescus in the Middle Ages, wherein grapes were infused with the blood of exsanguinated and murdered locals, unbeknownst to the outside world.\n\nMother Miranda briefly used the castle during her experiments on the nearby villagers with the Cadou parasite; one such experiment birthed Dimitrescu's daughters, Bela, Cassandra and Daniela, who aided the countess in capturing and torturing the villagers to feed on and manufacture their blood into exported wine. In 2021, the castle was largely damaged and eventually abandoned after Ethan Winters killed the Dimitrescu family in his search for his daughter, Rosemary. The following morning the village was destroyed when Winters detonated an N2 explosive, and though much of the forest was consumed by fire, Castle Dimitrescu survived.\n\nThe overall structure of the estate dates back to the European Middle Ages and largely conforms to architectural concepts derived during its High Renaissance period, crafted from stratified limestone comprising the turrets and battlements which adorn the castle's fog-enshrouded towers and snowy balustrades, interconnected by various belfries. The castle's exterior features several scarecrows among the fields, although compared to the traditional scarecrows seen in the village, these scarecrows are the hollowed-out bodies of House Dimitrescu's male victims.\n\nThe interior ornamentals of the castle adopt a heavily Baroque style, which came into prominence during the 17th century and suggest the castle may have been updated during that time. Light is intentionally left minimalized to sconces and candelabras throughout the castle, with many windows having been draped in thick curtains, leaving the vast majority of the castle steeped in shadow and secrecy. Its upper echelons are exquisitely decorated, complete with twisting hallways lacquered in ornate golden gildings of vines, expensive furniture, crystal chandeliers, and velvet carpeting lining its checkered marble floors, which extend from its entrance hall, main hall, and the Hall of Four, the sealed entryway to the Dimitrescu's outdoor family crypt, the Tower of Worship. Tall columns and pillars support the high domed ceilings of many chambers and are filled with statues, paintings and crests baring the history of the Dimitrescu bloodline; these consist of the dining room, dressing room, library, atelier, attic, armory, wine room, tasting room, opera hall, bedchamber, the Mistress of the castle's private quarters, and the Tower of Rage. Fireplaces located in several of these rooms are prominent centerpieces for warmth during the castle's harsh winter months, and a means for the castle's denizens to burn the remains of those victimized by them. A courtyard acts as a pathway to specific regions of the castle, among these the Halls of Ablution, Joy, Pleasure, and Sorrow. Per unknown arrangements with the Mistress of the castle, The Duke has secured a room in which to set up his emporium, providing a truce zone between himself and the Lady in which they could conduct private business dealings, and which later allowed him to supply weapons and information to Ethan Winters without her interference.\n\nThe castle's lower recesses, by contrast, are heavily decayed from disrepair, and are host to a kitchen, storage basement, distillery, and stone relief carved directly into the walls of the Hall of War; an artistic construct depicting 15th century soldiers during a time of battle, likely a point of reference to the means by which the Dimitrescu nobility first garnered control over the region. This symbolically serves as the only sealed passage to a vaulted dungeon fortified with iron cages, the likes of which are addled with gore left behind from its owners' violent activities on the prisoners contained therein. These dank caverns lead directly to the sealed off catacombs of the Chamber of Solace, where previous victims of the castle now wander endlessly in search of blood, forever trapped in a state worse than death.",

It was run by Karl Heisenberg in the 2020s.\n\nThe factory was originally constructed in the late 19th century under the Heisenberg family, and appears to have originally been a coal mine. The factory was visited by Norshteyn, a craftsman who resided in the village, who made a model of it.[1]\n\nUnder the ownership of the original foreman's descendant, Karl Heisenberg, it was repurposed as a weapons research facility. Deep underground, Heisenberg and a team of assistants experimented on the recently deceased, reviving them to a degree with Cadou parasites to serve as bioweapons, and saw a variety of mechanical augmentations to serve a series of roles from labourers to rank-and-file soldiers to special forces. The first of the three, known as the Haulers, were unsuitable for combat and relegated to support and non-combat roles such as mining to allow more additions to the factory. Heisenberg's ultimate plan was to mass-produce bio-weapons to rise up against Mother Miranda, the leader of the village.\n\nIn February 2021, the factory was infiltrated by a rogue BSAA unit, the \"Hound Wolves\", who planted explosives to cripple Heisenberg's war plans. When civilian Ethan Winters discovered their plans, Cpt. Chris Redfield repaired a self-propelled artillery for use in their plans. Winters rode the vehicle up a cargo elevator where he fought Heisenberg as a distraction while the factory was destroyed.\n\n\nHeisenberg's factory appeared to be a giant storage facility and processing plant at first glance, but its true nature was literally hidden below the surface. Deep underground lay a complex of metal buildings situated over an underground river; here, Heisenberg's \"willing\" test subjects were sorted and sent to different processing areas to be implanted with the Cadou and augmented with cybernetics. Heisenberg also used the facility to do his own research and combat trials with his creations, assessing them for flaws to be corrected in future models.\n\nThe factory has several levels that are mostly traversed by large elevators (one of which doubles as a safehouse/shop run by The Duke). Several set pieces (including doors, turbines, and a generator) have red-glowing ports that must be shot to proceed, similar to the weak points of Heisenberg's Soldat minions. One room contains a small casting machine that can be used to make a variety of items if Ethan finds and inserts the appropriate moulds; another room contains an elaborate Labyrinth puzzle that awards the Bister Skull if completed. At the very bottom of the facility, there is a large garage where Heisenberg's Self-propelled Artillery is situated, along with a cargo elevator that goes straight to ground level, emerging inside a building in the field outside the main factory.\n\n\nThe inhabitants are: Lord Karl Heisenberg, Haulers, Soldats, Strum.",

Their name is derived from the German word \"Soldat\", which means \"Soldier\".\n\n\nSome time after Karl Heisenberg was bestowed his factory, he started experimenting with human corpses to build an army of mechanically-modified mutants, intending to one day use them to overthrow Miranda.\n\nUsing Lycans to test their combat capabilities, Heisenberg continued to modify his Soldat designs, developing increasingly advanced models to achieve the desired performance.\n\nSoldats are mutated humans experimented on by replacing their heart with a Cadou parasite. Their muscles are stimulated with electricity, however they are nearly completely brain dead; as such, their only instinct is to destroy. Their craniums are outfitted with cybernetic headgear in order to stabilize their neural activity, allowing them to follow the most basic of commands; the ones with unstable physical condition are fitted with breathing apparatus to ensure they have sufficient oxygen supplied to their body. The rest of their body is equipped with other machinery to improve their combat capabilities.\n\nMost Soldats use arm-mounted drills to impale, bludgeon, and shred their enemies. Their main weakness is the red-glowing exhaust port on their chest, used to vent heat from their Cadou reactor. Unlike the other mutants infected by the Cadou, Soldats don't calcify but instead implode due to their reactor.\n\n\nThere are several variants of Soldat encountered throughout the factory:\n\nSoldat Eins: The basic Soldat variant, with the left arm replaced by a drill. Its name \"Eins\" means \"one\" in German, referring to its single drill arm.\n\nSoldat Zwei: An upgraded Soldat Eins with both arms replaced by drills. Reactor vent has also been moved to the back. Its name \"Zwei\" means \"two\" in German, referring to its double drill arms.\n\nSoldat Jet: An elite Soldat with a jet pack allowing it to make swift, lethal charges. Its head armor contains a laser sight to help it line up its dash attack; however, this can also give alert players warning to get out of the way.\n\nSoldat Panzer: A large Soldat with three drills on each arm and its entire body encased in heavy metal armor. Its name \"Panzer\" comes from the German word for \"armor\" or \"tank\", referring to its durable armored body.\n\nSturm: A unique Soldat prototype with a massive, bladed propeller mounted on its torso. Its name \"Sturm\" means \"storm\" in German.\n\n\nAll Soldats (except for the Sturm) use their arm-mounted drills to attack. Their weak point is the glowing Cadou reactor in their chest which briefly stuns them with a hit by a powerful firearm such as the W870 TAC. They will often attempt to shield their weak point with their drill arms, but shooting them in the head can destroy their control units, causing them to leave themselves open at the cost of increasing their aggression. The Soldat Panzer does not have an exposed reactor because of their heavy armor, and therefore the armor must be knocked off before the reactor is revealed.",

Sturm differed greatly from other subjects; instead of arm-mounted drills, its main weapon is a massive shredding device that replaces its head and torso, rendering it extremely dangerous in a head-on charge. However, Heisenberg considered Sturm to be a complete failure; it was practically uncontrollable and possessed very limited intelligence; at some point, it managed to lose its arms to its own propeller. As a result, Heisenberg kept Sturm in the lower levels of his factory as a guard/executioner, occasionally shouting at it to be quiet when its revving engine disturbed his train of thought.\n\n\nSturm was created in the same manner as its fellow Soldats, being a human augmented with extensive cybernetics and powered by a Cadou parasite. Its most notable feature is the massive turboprop engine mounted on its torso, with three chainsaw blades that essentially turn it into a lethal walking rotary fan. Unlike most Soldats, its reactor exhaust was located on its back instead of the front.\n\nDespite its top-heavy design and lack of arms (the latter apparently being due to it sticking them into its own propeller), Sturm seems to have no difficulty walking and running around. Heisenberg's notes describe it as having very low intelligence, although it still seems cognizant enough to recognize his voice and obey his commands.\n\n\nThe Sturm's main attack is to charge towards the player, dealing massive damage on contact. One charge is usually enough to knock down the player. Fortunately, it can't turn mid-charge and requires a moment to rev up its propeller before attacking, giving the player time to get out of its way. Like all Soldats, its red-glowing reactor exhaust is especially vulnerable to gunfire; the best time to shoot it is while Sturm is recovering from its charge.\n\nAfter taking sufficient damage, the Sturm will overheat and burst into flames. In this state, it can perform multiple charges in succession, and also rev up its propeller to engulf its surroundings in a flamethrower fashion, dealing rapid damage upon contact.\n\nUsing flash grenades will stun the Sturm and make him walk into a wall, leaving him open to attack. 8 shots from a full upgraded Power level on the Magnum will kill him.\n\nUpon its defeat, Sturm will shut down and explode like any other Soldat and will leave behind a Complex Mechanical Heart which can be sold for 45,000 lei.",

They were the brainchild of Mother Miranda, a mutant who sought to create a counterpart that would become host to a preserved copy of her daughter's conscious mind. Human experimentation with Cadou was extensive though largely unrewarding, with many hosts either dying or turning into Lycans. Over time, however, at least eight test subjects survived on with superhuman abilities, and began aiding Miranda in pursuing parallel research, being themselves unsuitable as hosts for Eva.\n\nCadou, like the Black God, assimilate the DNA of a host, and will alter the host to incorporate DNA from other organisms they have assimilated. The location of implantation varies, though it is uncertain if any change results from this; both head and abdominal surgery were methods used. Any foreign DNA within the host's body could also be assimilated by the Cadou and spliced into the host genome. Examples include the Dimitrescu daughters, who took on the ability to transform between mutant humans and fly swarms, and the Vârcolac who were humans contaminated with wolf blood. Cadou implantation can be very dangerous for the host, and often results in death within days. Those that do survive may turn into mutants such as Lycans, who were seen as failed adaptations in her superhuman project.\n\nCadou are also noted to be able to control sub-colonies of their own, and are able to survive when bisected. In the case of Donna Beneviento, the half in her body could control the other half planted within her doll, Angie, and was able to make the doll move on Beneviento's command. After contaminating the plants in her garden, Beneviento was also able to produce hallucinogenic pollen and influence its effects on enemies. Both the Angie Cadou and the plants died following the death of Beneviento, who was stabbed in the head where her Cadou was.",

Named from the Romanian word for \"werewolf\", they were the result of human experimentation with the splicing of wolf DNA. All vârcolaci are believed to be dead following the destruction of the region in February 2021.\n\n\n\nThe vârcolaci were a side-product of genetic-engineering conducted by Salvatore Moreau sometime after he had become one of the Four Lords,[1] created by injecting wolf blood into the spine of a Lycan; as such, the vârcolaci can be considered an off-shoot of the human Lycan.[2] Though considerably rarer than the Lycan, who treated them more as attack dogs than fellow Lycans,[3] they were nonetheless destructive and expanded their territory into the village in 2021. They were eventually killed off as a result of interventions from the BSAA and Ethan Winters, as well as the ecological destruction of their homeland by the Fungal Root.\n\n\nThe Vârcolac body is a mix of recognizably human and wolf traits. Like canines, they walk in a quadrupedal gait with hind legs that are awkwardly balanced, causing their knees to brush close to the ground as they tread on their heels. While their hands and feet appear human-like, their fingers are more elongated, resembling claws. An unusually large jaw consisting of sharp teeth tears across their skull, and their body is coated in thick hair, typically grey, which covers their spine and scalp prominently. The Vârcolac is effectively animalistic in intelligence, demonstrating no higher brain function than base instincts, and relies entirely on physical strength rather than weapons, unlike the Lycan.\n\n\nThe Vârcolac is very tough, and it is advised to fight it with high powered weapons or explosives. However, if the enemy is low on resources, it is better to sneak past it.\n\nThe Vârcolac will patrol a certain path when it is present. If it sees the enemy or the enemy shoots it, it will run towards the enemy and attempt to grab them. Due to its size, it cannot enter buildings. Despite this, it will attempt to get inside through windows or doors but will fail to do so and quickly lose interest. At this moment it is most vulnerable. Like Lycan, the Vârcolac can also jump on rooftops.\n\n\n",

            "content": "A Fungal root is the core of a Mold super-colony. Fungal Roots operate as an essential entity within these colonies, and are where copies of organisms' consciousnesses are stored. At least two Fungal Roots are known to have existed; the first lay beneath an ancient megalith called the Ceremony Site and was worshipped as the Black God, while the second was formed in 2014 in a second super-colony in Louisiana.\n\n\nHow ancient this organism was is unknown, as well as how it came to be. What is known is that it had consumed the bodies of many people buried in the area by the time of its modern discovery in 1919 by Miranda as well as stored and preserved their consciousnesses into itself.[1] After a century of planning, in 2021 the Fungus root's exponential growth was triggered and it began consuming the village, absorbing the DNA of any organism it came across so it could create replicas. The colony was finally destroyed when a powerful explosive device was planted at its core and detonated. This caused all of the fungus colony as well as its infected victims to die out.\n\n\nA fungal root was also created in Dulvey Parish, Louisiana when a Mold-contaminated oil tanker, Annabelle, was swept inland during a hurricane in October 2014. Over the next three years this super-colony spread for miles beneath swampland, into houses and into a salt mine. The conscious minds of those contaminated by Mold, regardless of distance, were ultimately duplicated and stored within this fungal root for later. It was discovered in July 2017 by Ethan and Mia Winters, the former of whom was briefly embedded within the core and communicated with the stored minds. This root was likely destroyed as part of the BSAA's sterilisation of the area.\n\n\nIn the mountain village, through a cavern covered in the crystalised remains of a fungal root. Whether this was the super-colony's first fungal root or simply a dead part of it is unknown.\n\n\nThe Mold's most noteworthy trait is its ability to absorb the genetics of its victims as well as their consciousness and store it within itself. This allowed the Mold to imprint knowledge of the consciousnesses stored within the Fungal Root onto a host it has symbiotically bonded with. Both Mother Miranda and Ethan Winters were in direct contact with the conscious minds 'archived' in their respective roots. In its external appearance, the Black God took the form of a human fetus.",

            "comment": "Mold",
            "constant": false,
            "content": "Mold is a genus of fungus which is believed to have originated in an Eastern European mountain range. Though its interactions with humans has taken place over centuries, it was first subject to scientific study in the early 20th century. Samples of Mold were obtained by The Connections in the 1990s as a potential source of bioweapons research, the result of which were human B.O.W.s capable of mind control. As many as six species of Mold are known to exist, separated between the naturally occurring Mold native to Europe and the A-Type through E-Type genetically modified species developed by The Connections.\n\n\nThe exact origins of the Mold are presently unknown, though anthropological and architectural evidence in Eastern Europe suggest the Black God supercolony lived for millennia. This supercolony is linked to a cave-dwelling society native to the region, who are said to have disappeared, and there are signs of increased Mold activity in the 15th century as well, where those infected by it were seen as monsters. The Mold first became the focus of scientific research in 1919, led by Miranda, a biologist of the region who herself mutated after being exposed to the fungus. For the next century, Miranda experimented on the other villagers and explored research into creating genetically modified organisms from the Mold, such as the Cadou. Having made physical contact with the Black God, Miranda assimilated memories from hundreds of thousands who had been consumed by the Black God since it had emerged. The Black God was destroyed in February 2021 following a BSAA operation, with a fragment of it surviving and being recovered by the BSAA.\n\n\nIn the 1990s, The Connections made contact with Miranda, seeking to genetically engineer a species of Mold to be sold as a black market bioweapon. Weaponisation of the Mold was initially conceptualized during their NEXBAS (next-generation experimental battlefield superiority) project in 2000, with the assistance of the H.C.F. in a technical capacity. Taking advantage of the Mold's natural quorum sensing abilities, work began on a bioweapon capable of neutralizing enemy combatants through mind control. Prototype human bioweapons were produced by infecting pre-Stage 4 human embryos with the prototype Mold species and cultivating the embryos over a period of 38-40 weeks. These bioweapons were to infect enemy combatants through physical contact, allowing the Mold to enter the body and form a mass in the brain. To maintain the bioweapons' cover, the embryos were genetically modified to rapidly age, with a regular course of medication preventing growth beyond that of a 10-year-old.\n\nOver several years, five lines of human B.O.W.s were created, each better able to control the Mold than the last and blend into human society. Each was given a letter-number designation to determine their position in the line, starting from A-E. The prototype E-Type, \"E-001\" — otherwise known as Eveline — showed remarkable abilities, able to use quorum sensing to affect individual human hosts. This would result in complete assimilation of Mold within an imitation human who would appear identical to their pre-infection self, as was the case of Ethan Winters, or result in the extreme mutation of imitation humans who would serve a specific purpose for the E-Type, such as Jack Baker. Those suffering mycosis deemed undesirable could also be simply consumed by the mycelia and killed, as was the case of Alan. In further analysis of Eveline's abilities, she was immediately able to induce visual hallucinations and bend the will of infected individuals from a distance, subjecting them to auditory hallucinations ranging from her talking, to humming, to a crowd of whispers, and even to sounds like a piano playing. These hallucinations could be used by the E-Type to drive their victims insane, especially to the point of self-mutilation, and the psychological shock helped break down the mind's natural barriers and open the way to Eveline's brainwashing abilities.\n\n\nThe Mold as a whole is identifiably fungal in nature, and bears some similarities to Cladosporium (black mold). However, it also possesses unique biological traits that separate it from other fungi. Mold is released into the air as spores and enters the bodies of host organisms, where in humans it proceeds to form a mycelial growth in the brain, resulting in a form of mycosis that leaves the host susceptible to quorum sensing. From there, spores detach from this growth and spread around the rest of the body. Upon contact with a cell, horizontal gene transfer takes place, resulting in the host's cells being replaced by near-identical imitation cells formed from the Mold.\n\n\nIn nature, two vastly different organisms are able to exchange genes unique to their class, phylum, or even kingdom, typically with a parasitic or prey organism transferring genes to its host or predator. For example, the DNA of the protozoa Plasmodium vivax is believed to include genes of human origin, and herring are known to have genes of piscean origin. Horizontal gene transfer between the Mold and other organisms, however, are far more extreme, with most or even the entirety of the host genome being transferred to the parasitic spores, which allow them to perfectly imitate their functions in the host body. In the case of Ethan Winters, prolonged mycosis resulted in every cell of his body being replaced with an imitation; though a thorough medical examination removed the mycelial cluster, the imitation cells were not identified at the time. In more extreme cases of mycosis, mycelial clusters will assimilate the DNA of various organisms, resulting in chimeras. This was seen in Marguerite Baker, a Louisiana housewife who was observed to grow imitation spiders, wasps and centipedes out of her fatty tissue, while her uterus became that of a beehive. These imitation organisms, imperfect replicas of naturally occurring arthropods, were capable of surviving independently.\n\n\nQuorum sensing is a biological function in which a change in behavior exhibited by one individual within a colony will have an effect on the others, even if not exposed to those same conditions. One example is that of Vibrio fischeri, a species of marine bacteria which is known to be bioluminescent, but will only express the necessary genes when it achieves a high population density. This density is determined by individual bacteria, which will release autoinducers when the set conditions have been achieved; the very presence of autoinducers then triggers the expression by other bacteria in the colony. In certain species of Pseudomonas, achieving a high-population density triggers the expression of anaerobic metabolic genes, allowing them to change from aerobic to anaerobic respiration.\n\nA very common side effect of the Mold is that the skin of the host turns a pale greenish tone due to the penetration of the fungus through the cells, although some individuals such as Karl Heisenberg, Ethan Winters and his daughter Rosemary Winters retained her human skin tone despite being infected.\n\nResearch by The Connections indicates an equivalent to quorum sensing is used by the Mold, and this function has been observed in both mycelia and imitation organisms, allowing for thoughts and memories to be exchanged between clusters just as information on a computer passes through a network. In Eastern Europe, Miranda was capable of dividing her body into a small colony of imitation animals that each would carry her conscious mind and operate together. She was able to use this ability to take the form of a murder of crows to travel long distances. The Dimitrescu daughters, Bela, Cassandra and Daniela, were themselves able to divide their bodies into swarms of flies which retained their intelligence. The E-Type human bioweapon, Eveline, was able to project her thoughts into the minds of those suffering from mycosis, which to others appeared in the form of visual and auditory hallucinations. By piggybacking on the mycelia growing in the walls and ground around the Baker ranch, Eveline was able to project these thoughts into people on the other side of the ranch, such as Mia and Ethan Winters' recorded hallucinations of her in the Old House.\n\n\nWhen a Mold supercolony has reached sufficient mass, it will begin forming a mycorrhiza. As observed both in Eastern Europe and Louisiana, these are large mycelial masses that occupy a large volume of space, and are used as a vault where memories and assimilated DNA can be stored there indefinitely. They are often referred to as Fungal Roots. During his experiences in Louisiana, Winters was briefly consumed by the mycorrhiza there, and was able to communicate with an archive of Jack Baker's conscious mind, who was able to recall meeting Eveline three years prior. When Miranda touched the Black God mycorrhiza in Europe, she was able to experience the memories of people who had been dead for centuries. This archival ability was put to the ultimate test in 2021, when Miranda attempted to coax the Black God into transferring an archive of her deceased daughter Eva's conscious mind into that of Rosemary Winters. Though the attempt was a failure, this was due to unforeseen conditions unrelated to the Black God, which could have succeeded otherwise.\n\n\nAs assimilated DNA can be stored in the Mycorrhiza, at a certain size it is capable of budding. In 2021, it was observed by both Winters and Cpt. Chris Redfield that the Black God itself was growing imitation moroi and lycans, dropped onto the ground from its tentacles. Like the arthropods that grew from Marguerite Baker in Louisiana, these organisms were able to survive on their own.\n\n\nThere are a number of substances in existence which have been developed with the intention of either directly destroying the Mold or treating individuals infected by it.\n\nThe Connections themselves formulated a serum which could be made from D-Type body parts which was capable of restoring conscious control to those infected by Mold from an E-Type subject and reducing the influence that the subject had over the infected. The first known use of this serum was in 2015 when The Connections gave a sample to Lucas Baker in exchange for monitoring Eveline. Two more samples were manufactured in July 2017 by Ethan Winters with the assistance of Zoe Baker; one was used to calcify a heavily-mutated Jack Baker while the other was used on Mia Winters.\n\nAdditionally, The Connections created a line of necrotoxins for each of their B.O.W. lines for the purposes of subject disposal, presumably if a subject becomes too uncontrollable. Each necrotoxin requires tissue samples from the specific series it is designed to neutralize to be stimulated in specialized synthesis equipment. For example, Ethan Winters was able to manufacture a sample of the E-Necrotoxin using tissue samples from Eveline which he had received from Mia. The necrotoxin caused Eveline to melt, but she then proceeded to merge with nearby Mold to create a gigantic monstrous form. Nonetheless, she was finished off by Ethan.\n\nBlue Umbrella had also been researching the Mold for some time and developed their own measures against this bioweapon. One of their innovations is Rapid-Acting Mycetotoxic ROunDs (RAMRODs), ammunition laced with a mycetotoxic compound released on impact which rapidly destroys fungal membranes and prevents their regeneration. This in turn weakens fungal B.O.W.s and makes them more susceptible to conventional damage. They also were able to create a cure for the E-Type infection, which can be synthesized in the field and successfully purge the mutamycete from an infected host.",

Whereas other retroviruses, such as Human Immunodeficiency Virus, target particular cells of a particular animal's body, Progenitor is capable of infecting the cells of any organism, whether animal, fungal, plant, or bacterial.\n\nConsiderable research on Progenitor has been undertaken since its discovery in the late 1960s, and a number of engineered strains have since come into existence primarily for bioweapons research.",

Spencer as part of a special screening process for identifying the most genetically gifted of the Wesker children. Only two of the thirteen remaining test subjects survived: Albert Wesker and Alex Wesker. They survived largely due to special genetic markers.\n\nAlbert had injected the virus on July 24, 1998, during the Mansion Incident. William Birkin had given him the virus. This allowed him to survive impalement from the T-002 and to escape the Spencer Mansion before the Triggering System had detonated, unbeknownst to Umbrella and the remaining S.T.A.R.S. members. The power gained from the virus allowed Albert to become a global threat.\n\nAlex had injected the virus sometime after contracting an illness. She had survived the infection but lacked certain unique physical benefits that Albert had possessed. Alex had attempted to commit suicide in 2011 during the Sejm Island incident, but had only entered a dormant state due to the virus and awoke in a body mutated by her own T-Phobos Virus.",

            "content": "Tyrant Virus, also known as the T-Virus, is the general name given to a series of mutant Progenitor virus strains.\n\nInitially developed by Umbrella Pharmaceuticals in the late 1960s, the primary goal of the \"t-Virus Project\" was to effectively eliminate the need for a large-scale conventional army and generate revenue for their eugenics program, the Wesker Project. This required two things: the virus had to be highly contagious to the point of infecting an entire target population and guarantee a 100% mortality rate.[1][2] However, such a virus was deemed impossible due to the tendency of highly contagious diseases to kill too many people at once and prevent further spread.\n\nBy 1978, the development focus shifted from creating a lethal, highly contagious virus to one that would mutate hosts to become physically stronger and remain alive despite organ failures and severe brain damage. The latter led to murderous aggression and an obsessive hunger that drove individuals to cannibalism. Additionally, with the discovery in 1981 that approximately 10% of any population was naturally immune or unmutated asymptomatic carriers, Phase 2 of the research project aimed at finding workarounds. While an improved t-Virus with 0% immunity was being developed, the Arklay Laboratory team, led by Dr. William Birkin, engineered a new species of animal that could hunt down and kill survivors. This effort began with the creation of simple Bio-Organic Weapons such as the Web Spinner and progressed with the development of the genetically chimeric Hunter α.",

It was hoped that the improved t-Virus strain would create mutants more adequate for sale as military products, and dobermans were specifically selected for the project due to their traits favouring military service. Though they suffered skin deterioration, their muscles were left largely intact, and this and their increased strength and aggression made them more dangerous. As this B.O.W. species was created from an existing animal, unlike the Hunter Program, the cost to create the Cerberus prototypes was low. Deemed a success, the later Cerberuses were created by cloning one of the prototypes. The Arklay Laboratory conducted testing on these dogs in the courtyard until the t-Virus outbreak in 1998 when they escaped. Hungry and lacking their Umbrella trainers, they turned feral and began killing and eating hikers out in the Arklay Mountains.\n\nWhen exposed to the β strain, one of the Doberman test subjects experienced a dramatic increase in strength and fighting instincts. The subject also lost the ability to be afraid, making it unperturbed by loud noises such as gunshots. In keeping with a dog's inherently sociable nature, the test subject was able to be trained to follow basic orders. This test subject was subsequently cloned to ensure all Cerberuses had the same advantages.",

This required two things: the virus had to be highly contagious to the point of infecting an entire target population and guarantee a 100% mortality rate. However, such a virus was deemed impossible due to the tendency of highly contagious diseases to kill too many people at once and prevent further spread.\n\nLike any other virus, t-Viruses make contact with a cell's membrane and insert their genetic coding into the cell. The viral genome is absorbed into the cell, hijacking its intended functions and using them to produce virions similar to the original virus. The newly formed virions are then released from the host cell and infect neighboring cells, initiating the process once again.\n\nSeveral diseases have been associated with t-Virus infection. The first, tentatively referred to as \"Progenitor disease,\" is a fatal viral illness caused by Progenitor and early t-Virus strains. The exact mechanism of this disease is unknown, including whether it triggers a cytokine storm or rapidly mutates the patient until death. However, the most common disease caused by t-Viruses is Cannibal Disease, a condition in which patients mutate to gain enhanced survival capabilities at the cost of brain damage and homicidal urges. Advanced-stage Cannibal Disease patients are referred to as \"Zombies,\" while pre-symptomatic and early-symptomatic cases can be treated with antiretroviral drugs.",

Umbrella USA pioneered research on human mutants from 1988 to 1998 in their Tyrant Project, named after the virus itself. Tyrants are distinguished from the typical human mutant, Zombies, by possessing certain genes relating to intelligence. Tyrants were intended to be the \"ultimate bio-weapon\" for military use due to this intelligence. Ultimately, specimens and research outlived Umbrella itself. \n\nThe Tyrant Project's experiment outlines ultimately produced two main varieties of Tyrant to serve as B.O.W. products – the 'infiltration type' and 'combat type', respectively. The role of the infiltration-type is to blend in with a population centre to take part in covert operations, and are typically given heavy clothing to aide this; they are generally the more human in appearance. Combat types meanwhile are intended for battle, and are typically taller and deformed, and are often naked.\n\nAs a typical effect of t-Virus infection, Tyrants experience increased production of Human Growth Hormone, though this hormone is produced at greater quantities than that of Zombies. While the shortest of Tyrants, the T-103 series, were close to 7 feet in height, a later Tyrant series produced by a third party was pushing 12 feet in height. \n\nTyrants are also noted for their impressive physical abilities, being capable of jumping several storeys, bursting through concrete, flipping over tanks, and even redirecting rockets. Combat-type Tyrants experience extended arm growth resulting in a claw on at least one arm – muscle strength in the Tyrants is powerful enough human beings can be impaled and held up by these claws. Being developed for covert ops, infiltration types like the T-103 do not have claws unless the power limiter has been disabled.",

Golgotha was developed by william birkin of Umbrella USA as a bioweapon to rival and surpass the Tyrant Virus. The two viruses, while being descended from Progenitor, are totally dissimilar. Whereas the t-Virus typically causes relatively minor mutations in human hosts, such as Zombies and Tyrants, Golgotha causes such extreme genetic mutations that victims are no longer recognizable as human. Human t-Virus mutants are almost unanimously infertile, while Golgotha's \"G\" mutants are highly fertile and capable of asexual reproduction. The t-Virus causes necrosis of the body as a side-effect, while Golgotha is capable of repairing dead cells and even reviving the dead. Because of these factors, Golgotha is regarded as one of the greatest threats to the planet if an outbreak were to occur.\n\nGolgotha has extreme effects on the human body. The virus infects cells close by, turning them into so-called \"G-Cells.\" These G-Cells then produce more of the virus, which spreads further across the body. As this gradual spread starts from the point of infection, the body may mutate asymmetrically.  \n\nGolgotha's extreme mutations are not stopped simply from the creation of G-Cells. If part of the body is injured, it will regenerate, ultimately causing the host's DNA to be rewritten, leading to significant changes in the body during the regeneration. In the case of Dr. Birkin, he grew an entirely new, functional head, with his original head being moved down to the chest and eventually disappearing entirely.[14] Other noticeable aspects of the extreme mutations were the growth of a second pair of arms, which later mutated further into feet, and the reshaping of the rib cage into a mouth with bone teeth. With each physical trauma he received, Birkin's mutations grew more and more severe, until his form could no longer be recognized as human.",

            "content": "Uroboros is an RNA virus in the Progenitor family. It was engineered in the 21st century by Dr. Albert Wesker as the ultimate eugenics tool. Currently, there is no known vaccine for either strain of Uroboros. The virus is named after the Ouroboros in Greek mythology, which is a snake or snake-like creature that consumed itself.\n\nComparable to the Progenitor virus, the Uroboros disease is noted to be almost always lethal in humans, with the exception of those with a particular genetic trait shared with the Ndipaya King. The disease goes through two stages, which can be defined as early and later symptomatic stages.\n\nIn the early symptomatic stage, patients are known to experience sweating, labored breathing, and confusion or delirium. The Uroboros Project research team noted in their findings that the onset of symptoms appeared immediately after infection. However, it should be noted that patients in the lab trial were each infected with massive viral loads, equating to one vial for people over 60 kg and two-thirds for those at 40–60 kg.\n\nIn the later stage of infection, the patient's condition will develop in one of two ways. If the patient has the advantageous genetic trait, the virus will enter a lysogenic stage and mutate the host at a slow rate. Patients without this trait, however, will experience runaway mutations that result in the patient being violently torn apart and killed. The infected biomatter continues to endure as its own separate entity, known only as \"Uroboros\".\n\nLike the Progenitor and Golgotha viruses, Uroboros is able to repair dead cells and revive the dead, which results in Zombies who demonstrate neither superhuman abilities nor become typical Uroboros. The extent of Tricell's research into Uroboros Zombies is limited, however, and should be noted.\n\nFrom a biological standpoint, Uroboros creatures can be described as anomalous masses of black biomatter. This mass often has tubular characteristics, echoing its namesake, though rather than resembling a snake, these creatures' tubules branch off from one another like tree roots, and can be melded back into the mass to grow elsewhere. When an Uroboros creature makes contact with other organisms, it consumes and converts them into biomatter for its own growth. ",

Eventually, Umbrella would prove to be too troublesome to the Federation, heavily involved in the business of Bio Organic Weapons. This practice would eventually prove to be the undoing of the company.\n\nWesker agreed to provide Tricell with the viral samples of the Tyrant virus and the T-Veronica virus for research in exchange for capital to add to his accumulated resources which are salvaged from Umbrella which he initially intended to replace.",
