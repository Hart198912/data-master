Not in the way it used to be, years ago, when a well-executed performance left her with that rare, fleeting satisfaction of a job done right. No, this was different. This was *annoyance* curling in her gut, a headache already forming at the base of her skull, tension knotting between her shoulders.  \r\n\r\nShe wasn’t even looking at them yet. Just standing there, one hand on her hip, the other running through her hair, dragging her fingers through the strands like she could pull patience from somewhere deep inside herself. They were watching her, she could feel it, but she wasn’t ready to give them that yet.  \r\n\r\nNot until she had a better grip on whether she wanted to *talk* this out or start throwing things.  \r\n\r\n\"*What the fuck* was that?\"  \r\n\r\nHer voice came out steady, measured, even a little bored. That was the trick—never let them know how close she was to losing her mind. They expected her to yell. Everyone always did. But Matty didn’t *do* screaming matches. She’d been in the business too long to waste energy on theatrics.  \r\n\r\nThey shifted, but they didn’t answer. Not yet.  \r\n\r\nOf course not. *Brat.*  \r\n\r\nShe finally looked at them, taking in the way they leaned against the counter, all nonchalance, like this was some minor inconvenience instead of the complete *shitshow* they’d just pulled onstage. Maybe they were still riding the adrenaline, maybe they thought she’d just let it go, or maybe—*and this was what really pissed her off*—they just wanted to see how far they could push her before she snapped.  \r\n\r\n\"You think this is funny?\" she asked, tilting her head, arms crossing over her chest. Her nails drummed lightly against the leather of her jacket, her patience thinning by the second. \"You think I *like* getting calls from label reps five minutes after the encore? Watching security scramble because *somebody*—\" her gaze flicked to them, sharp as a blade, \"*—can't keep their shit together for ninety goddamn minutes?*\"  \r\n\r\nShe could feel it now—that slow burn of frustration settling deep, coiling tight inside her ribs. And the worst part? She wasn’t even surprised.  \r\n\r\nBecause this was what they *did*, wasn’t it?  \r\n\r\nPush. Test. See how much rope she was willing to give before they finally ran out of slack.  \r\n\r\nShe should’ve known from the moment she took this job that they’d be the biggest pain in her ass. The others were bad, sure—Ransom with his pathetic god complex, Jax with his reckless streak, Rowan with his brooding *I’m the only sane one here* attitude, and Elliot, who somehow always looked like he was plotting a murder in his head even when he was just thinking about what to get for dinner. But *them*?  \r\n\r\nThey were different.  \r\n\r\nThey weren’t just reckless. They were *calculated*. They *knew* exactly what they were doing, exactly how to toe the line between genius and disaster, and worst of all?  \r\n\r\nThey were *good*.  \r\n\r\nThat’s what pissed her off the most.  \r\n\r\nBecause if they weren’t talented, if they weren’t magnetic on stage, if they weren’t one of the best things to happen to this band—they’d be *gone*. She would’ve cut them loose the second they pulled their first stunt. Wouldn’t have wasted her breath on this conversation. Wouldn’t have stayed up late putting out fires because they *refused* to follow the rules like a normal person.  \r\n\r\nBut instead, here she was.  \r\n\r\nAgain.  \r\n\r\nMatty inhaled through her nose, exhaled slow, measured. \"I don’t care how good you think you are,\" she said, voice low, even. \"*I* don’t care.

Their dynamic is a volatile mix of frustration and reluctant admiration, with Hailee constantly testing boundaries while Matty balances control and exasperation.\n\n#### **Key Plot Points:**\n1. **Post-Show Confrontation:** Matty corners Hailee after an unruly performance, demanding accountability for their antics.\n2. **Drug Use Provocation:** Hailee casually does a line in front of Matty, deliberately provoking her before the meet-and-greet.\n3. **Physical Tension Escalates:** Snapping teeth near Matty’s ear earns Hailee a warning grip on her neck—dominance met with defiance but no real resistance.\n4. **Meet-and-Greet Chaos:** Hailee dives into the crowd with rockstar bravado—signing autographs on fans’ bodies and downing strangers’ drinks while Matty watches like a hawk, torn between irritation and reluctant amusement.\n\n#### **Character Analysis:**\n- ***Matilde Vance***: Exhausted but sharp as ever; her patience is fraying yet she can’t deny Hailee’s talent (or how much she *likes* the challenge). Beneath the stern exterior lingers begrudging protectiveness—and maybe something warmer she won’t admit yet.\n- ***Hailee Mikaelson***: A brat in its purest form—submissive beneath the rebellion, craving attention (especially from Matty) but too proud to ask for it outright. Her recklessness masks deep-seated neediness and admiration for her manager's unshakable control.\n\n#### **Relationship Dynamics:**\nA push-pull power struggle laced with unresolved tension: every act of defiance from Hailey is an invitation for discipline; every show of dominance from Mattie only fuels Hailie's audacity further Unspoken attraction simmers beneath professional frustration neither will address first\n\n### Memorable Moments:\n- The moment when Mattie grabs Hailie by back neck whispering threat drag you out by hair\"—Hailies laughter response underscores their game mutual understanding limits being tested without true fear\n- Hailies deliberate provocation snapping teeth near Matties ear then dancing away perfectly encapsulates their dynamic defiance wrapped up playful challenge\n\n### Current Situation:\nMattie stands guard during meet-and-greet watching like coiled spring ready intervene if needed while secretly admiring how effortlessly Hailie commands room despite being complete disaster waiting happen\n\n### Potential Directions:\n1 Breaking Point Either finally snaps dragging off somewhere private teach lesson proper way OR gives rare praise throwing off balance entirely\n2 Jealousy Sparked Jax causing scene over attention given leading protective confrontation between him/Mattie where lines blur further\n3 Vulnerability Moment Accident injury/overwhelm forces brief truce revealing softer layers beneath usual games"},"force_avatar":"User Avatars/1746733452980-Hailee.png","tracker":{}}
