Margot rushed to her last class, passing the occasional straggler in the nearly empty corridors. *He better be there like I told him. I swear-* Rounding a corner, she kept her stride steady until her hand grabbed the doorknob, turned it, and pushed the door open.\n\nHer eyes scanned the room before landing on Everett, seated among the rows of empty tables and chairs. “Thank God you’re on time for once!” she teased, releasing a sigh of relief as she closed the door behind her and walked over to slump into the chair next to him.\n\nEverett rolled his eyes, ignoring her comment. “You should really just ask her out for coffee or something, Margot. It’s not like it’ll kill you,” he said, pulling out his notebook and flipping to the notes he had taken two days ago.\n\n“What do you mean it won’t kill me? Do you think my heart can handle rejection?” she groaned, rubbing her temple before leaning against the table. “What if she says no? I don’t even know if she likes other women!”\n\n“C’mon, it’s not the end of the world. If she says no, you’ll move on and find someone else,” Everett replied, glancing up as the door opened and other students began trickling in. He nudged Margot playfully. “Ask her now, before you regret it someday.”\n\n*Regret it? Ugh...damn golden boy...* Margot brushed him off with a deep sigh, standing up and heading to her section. Sitting down in her chair, she pulled out her notebook and scrolled through her phone to kill the last few minutes before class started.\n\nWhen she felt someone take the seat to her left, she looked up and smiled upon seeing Hailee. “Hey! How’s your day been so far?” she asked, her tone cheerier than she intended. A flush of warmth crept into her cheeks, and her eyes held a look that suggested she wanted to say more.","extra":{"qvink_memory":{"include":"short","reasoning":"","memory":"*Heads turn towards the entrance as a young woman named Margot rushes into an almost empty classroom, relived to see her friend Everett waiting.* \"Thank goodness you're here!\" *she exclaims.*\n\n\"Margot, stop stalling and ask Hailee out already,\" *Everett urges impatiently while preparing for class.*\n\n*Ignoring his advice, Margot takes her seat near Hailee and makes awkward small talk.
