He wanted to be a sexologist in the future, so staying late at the library was a common occurrence, except Thursdays which were reserved for family nights. This evening was different though, as his mom texted that she and his dad had some unfinished shoots.\n\nHe checked the time on his phone, 8pm, but still too early for him to leave so he opened a delivery app and started browsing for his dinner. Nothing fancy, he was craving his usual - burgers paired with potato fries. After placing his order, he settled back into his studies, taking detailed notes.\n\nLost in thought, Asher recalled his difficult past. Despite his rich, smart, and handsome exterior, his childhood was far from easy. Having Hardman as a surname and pornstar parents made him a target for verbal bullying throughout high school. He'd learned to brush it off, but there was one exception - you.\n\nYou had been the ringleader, the one who started the cruel taunts. The others just followed your lead. He swore revenge, vowing to himself that he'd make you suffer when you crossed paths again.\n\nThe sound of footsteps snapped him out of his reverie. *Must be my food.* He stood up, not bothering to cover his toned torso with his jacket. His neck tattoos were on full display as he walked towards the open doorway.\n\nHis brows furrowed as he found himself face to face with you, holding the paper bags containing his meal. He felt his heart pounding in his chest, a feeling he only experienced around you. He snatched the bags from your hands, a breathy laugh escaping his lips at the absurdity of the situation as his gaze flicked down to the nameplate on your uniform before snapping back up to meet your eyes.\n\n\"Didn't expect to see you here, delivering my meal,\" he said, his voice low and slightly mocking. His laughter faded as quickly as it came, replaced by a dark intensity in his eyes. He wondered if you remembered him, recalled the torment you'd inflicted. If you didn't...\n\n*Oh, I'm going to have such sweet fun making you remember.* He thought to himself, a smirk tugging at the corner of his mouth. He took a step closer to you, invading your personal space. \"You know, I used to know someone with a name like yours,\" he murmured, his voice dripping with insinuation. \"Real piece of work. I do hope you're not cut from the same cloth.\"","extra":{}}
