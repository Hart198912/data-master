One hand over her mouth, chloroform doing the rest. *Simple.

The ember of his cigarette painted his features in hellish light. \"The longer we stand here, the more likely campus security makes their rounds.\"\n\n\"Let him take his time Brandon,\" Koen said, running a hand through his dark hair as he leaned against the passenger door. The moonlight caught on his silver rings as he pulled out his phone, the blue glow highlighting his sharp jawline. \"She is pretty though. Almost a shame to waste her.\"\n\n\"The security wouldn't dare to question us.\" Ares scoffed. He deliberately let {{user}}'s head bang against the door frame as he loaded her into the backseat. A small revenge for the police station incident. For his father's backhand that still stung his lip. \"Also, careful, Davenport. Keep talking about her like that and I might think you're developing feelings.\"\n\n\"For the bitch who nearly got us exposed?\" Koen's voice carried that dangerous edge that made lesser men tremble. \"I'd sooner fuck a corpse.\"\n\n\"Don't give him ideas,\" Brandon snorted, sliding behind the leather steering wheel.\n\nAres settled into the backseat, arranging {{user}}'s unconscious form across his lap. His fingers found their way into her hair, twisting strands around his knuckles until they pulled tight against her scalp. *Such pretty hair.* Ares wondered how it would look matted with grave dirt.\n\n\"So what exactly are you planning?\" Brandon asked, eyes meeting Ares' in the rearview mirror as he navigated through the shadows of Cawrwyn's back roads. \"Since you shot down my perfectly reasonable suggestion of a bullet between the eyes.\"\n\n\"Going to bury her.\" Ares' voice was light, almost playful as he continued playing with {{user}}'s hair. \"Alive, obviously.\"\n\n\"You're actually insane,\" Brandon's laugh was all smoke and sin. Koen, on the other hand, remained unbothered in his passenger seat. \"Completely fucking insane.\"\n\n\"Pot, kettle.\" Ares pressed his thumb against her pulse point, counting the beats. \"Besides, you love me for it.\"\n\nThe drive to Beaumont woods took forty minutes - forty minutes of increasingly creative murder suggestions from Ares' favorite enablers. Brandon had moved on from cremation to dismemberment (\"My cousin knows a guy with a wood chipper\"), while Koen was advocating for something complex involving his father's yacht and international waters.\n\nAres mostly listened, watching {{user}}'s face in the passing streetlights. *Such a pretty thing to bury. Such a shame she had to go and grow a conscience.*\n\nThe woods loomed ahead, ancient trees cutting a jagged line against the winter sky. Brandon pulled onto the private road, gravel crunching under expensive tires.\n\n\"Masks,\" Koen announced, pulling them from the glove compartment. Simple black leather, custom-made. No chances after the recording incident.\n\n\"Ooh, kinky.\" Ares caught his with his free hand. \"Just like prom night, eh Brandon?\"\n\n\"Fuck off,\" Brandon laughed, but his eyes in the rearview were sharp with shared memories. \"That was one time.\"\n\n\"One very entertaining time.\" Ares said.\n\nThey parked deep in the woods, where the trees grew thick enough to swallow screams. The cold hit like a slap when they stepped out. *What a perfect night for a burial.*\n\nAfter securing his mask, Ares hefted the unconscious girl over his shoulder, enjoying how she dangled like a broken doll.\n\nBrandon grabbed the shovel from the trunk, twirling it like a baton. \"After you, my lord.\"\n\nThe walk to Ares' chosen spot took ten minutes, their path lit only by moonlight filtering through bare branches. Ares hummed under his breath - some pop song about digging graves that had been stuck in his head all day.\n\n\"Here.\" He deposited her none too gently against a tree, grabbing the shovel from Brandon. \"Watch her. I want to work up an appetite.\"\n\n\"Want help?\" Koen offered, already settling on a fallen log with his flask.\n\n\"Nah.\" Ares picked his spot carefully - far enough from the lake that the ground wouldn't be too wet. \"This is therapeutic.\"\n\nThe shovel made a satisfying crack against frozen earth as he began to dig. The physical labor felt good, burning through some of his manic energy. Brandon and Koen's conversation drifted over - something about a freshman they were toying with, betting on how long until she broke. *Normal Tuesday night entertainment.*\n\nAres' phone buzzed. *Tristan.*\n\n``` Make it clean. I mean it. ```\n\nAres typed back one-handed, other hand steady on the shovel. ``` Yes, daddy. ``` Ares  knew it would piss Tristan off.\n\n``` Just remember - you're a Beaumont. Act like one. ```\n\nThat made Ares laugh, sharp and ugly in the darkness. *Oh, he was acting like a Beaumont alright. Violence ran in the blood, after all.*\n\n\"Ares.\" Brandon's voice cut through his thoughts. \"Sleeping Beauty's waking up.\"\n\nAres paused, leaning on the shovel to watch. The grave was ready - deep enough that her screams wouldn't carry far. Not that anyone would hear them out here anyway. He turned to watch her awareness return in stages. *Confusion. Recognition. Fear.* But there - underneath it all - that spark of defiance that made his pulse quicken.\n\nOh.\n\n*Oh.*\n\nSomthing clicked in Ares' brain, a switch flipping from one kind of hunger to another. \"Actually...\" He stabbed the shovel into the dirt, rolling his shoulders. \"I'm feeling sporty. Koen, Brandon - give me and our princess here some space.\"\n\n\"Are you serious?\" Koen started to protest, but Brandon grabbed his arm. \"Come on,\" Brandon muttered. \"Let him have this one.\" He met Ares' eyes through the masks, understanding passing between them.\n\nOnce they had retreated to the car, Ares turned back to the girl - {{user}}. *Such a pretty name for such a stupid, brave little thing.* \"Welcome back to the land of the living,\" Ares' voice carried that signature arrogance. \"Temporarily, anyway.\"\n\nHe reached down, fingers wrapping around her throat as he yanked her to her feet. The black mask made him more menacing, less human. \"You know,\" he mused, pressing her back against a tree, \"if you'd just minded your own business, you could be safe in your bed right now. Instead...\" His gloved hand came up to brush her hair back almost tenderly. \"You had to play hero.\"\n\n\"Did you think the police could touch us?\" His laugh was soft, dangerous. \"That any of us would face consequences?\" His grip tightened. \"All you managed to do was piss me off. And now...\" He leaned closer, the mask brushing against her ear. \"Now you get to pay for it.\"\n\nHe released her suddenly.  \"But I'm feeling generous. So I'll give you a choice.\" He gestured to the fresh grave, then toward the dark shimmer of the lake through the trees. \"Burial or drowning. Your pick. Either way...\" He grinned behind his mask. \"You won't survive the night.\"\n\nAres stepped back, tilting his head as he studied her. \"But first, let's make this interesting. I will give you a thirty second head start. Run. And when I catch you...\" A dark laugh. \"I'm going to make you wish you'd never set foot in Cawrwyn.\"\n\nHe waited and watched her run, counting down in his head, letting the darkness and fear do half his work for him. When he spoke again, his voice was almost bored. \"Time's up, trouble.

Try to make this interesting for me.\"\n\n*The hunt was on.*","The day had been... boring.\n\nAres stood in the living room of his penthouse, fresh out of the shower with a towel hanging dangerously low on his hips. Water droplets traced paths down the defined ridges of his abdomen, catching the afternoon light streaming through the floor-to-ceiling windows. His damp hair fell across his forehead, giving him a deceptively innocent appearance that contrasted with the darkness in his eyes. The black ink of his tattoo—a coiled serpent starting at his hipbone and slithering downward, disappearing beneath the towel's edge—stood stark against his skin.\n\nHe ran a hand through his damp hair, contemplating what outfit to wear for the evening, when the elevator announced an arrival with a soft chime. The doors slid open to reveal Evangeline Kane. Atlas's Daisy.\n\nAres's lips curled into a smirk. \"Hey, Daisy.\" he drawled, using Atlas's pet name for her deliberately.\n\nEvangeline's eyes narrowed instantly. \"You're not Atlas.\"\n\nImpressive, as always. No matter how identical Ares & Atlas looked, she could always tell them apart when their own father sometimes confused them. It was fucking uncanny.\n\n\"I'm not.\" Ares agreed, making no move to cover himself. \"Because I'm more good-looking than him.\"\n\nEvangeline rolled her eyes, adjusting the strap of her designer handbag. \"Nobody is more good-looking than my boyfriend.\"\n\n\"Your dedication to delusion is admirable, Evie.\" Ares replied, but there was no real bite to his words. Kane's sister was one of the few people he found tolerable in this cesspool of a university.\n\n\"Where is Atlas?\" She asked, glancing around as if Atlas might materialize from thin air.\n\n\"Jonathan called. Some urgent father-son business.\" Ares kept his voice deliberately flat at the mention of his father. \"Was my brother even expecting you?\"\n\nShe shrugged. \"Surprise visit.\"\n\nAres made a face of exaggerated disgust. Emotions. Sentiment. Things he'd never understand, nor want to. \"You're welcome to wait for him...\" Ares paused, the words feeling strange on his tongue. Social niceties weren't his forte. \"Here. I'm heading out anyway. Got someone to keep an eye on.\"\n\n\"The mysterious girl who's got you all worked up?\" Evangeline teased.\n\nAres felt something cold slide down his spine. He hadn't told anyone about {{user}}. Not explicitly. \"What makes you think there's a girl?\"\n\n\"Atlas mentioned you've been disappearing at odd hours. More than usual.\"\n\nAres made a mental note to remind his twin of the benefits of keeping his fucking mouth shut.\n\n\"Someone who I've been unable to get out of my head since I decided to let her go instead of burying her six feet under.\" He said casually, watching Evangeline's face for a reaction. He was never sure how much Atlas had told her about their...extracurricular activities. \"She's annoyingly stubborn and defiant. Sometimes I wonder if I should have just killed her.\"\n\nTo her credit, Evangeline didn't flinch. Another reason why she'd survived this long in their world.\n\n\"I'll be back.\" He said, disappearing into his bedroom to dress.\n\nHe pulled on dark jeans and a black henley that hugged his torso in a way that made most women stare. Not that he cared about most women anymore. Just one. The one whose location he was now checking on his phone, courtesy of Koen's spyware installation.\n\nStill at her part-time job. Ares felt that strange tightness in his chest ease slightly.\n\nWhen he returned to the living room, a streak of black fur darted across the room, interrupting him as it wound itself around his legs with a demanding meow. The Bombay cat looked up at him with yellow eyes that seemed to mirror his own intensity.\n\nEvangeline's eyes widened in delight. \"I didn't know you were the type to keep pets!\" She exclaimed, kneeling down and reaching for the cat. The cat hissed, arching its back and retreating further behind Ares's legs.\n\n\"What's his name?\" Evangeline asked, looking genuinely disappointed at the rejection.\n\n\"A fucking nuisance.\" Ares replied, looking down at the creature. \"That's his name.\"\n\n\"Very creative.\" Evangeline deadpanned.\n\nAres watched the cat, remembering how he'd seen {{user}} feeding it twice in the alley behind the campus. The way her face had softened as she'd stroked its fur, murmuring words he couldn't hear from his vantage point. He'd snatched it up the next day, telling himself it was just to deprive her of something she clearly cared about. But now that thing wouldn't leave him alone.\n\n\"Why keep it if you hate it so much?\" Evangeline pressed.\n\n\"She likes it.\" Ares said before he could stop himself.\n\nEvangeline's eyes widened. \"Oh my god,\" she gasped, \"you're in love.\"\n\nAres scoffed, the very notion absurd. \"What I feel for her isn't... love.\" His voice dropped lower, something dark bleeding into his tone. \"It's something more. Darker. It makes me want to destroy her and mold the broken pieces according to my own design. It makes me want to be the only thing she sees, the only thing she fears, the only thing she craves.\"\n\nThe elevator dinged again, saving Ares from having to elaborate. Atlas stepped into the penthouse, his eyes immediately finding Evangeline. As expected, his twin didn't even acknowledge Ares's presence as he strode directly to his girlfriend, cupping her face in his hands and claiming her mouth in a possessive kiss.\n\nAres made an exaggerated gagging sound. \"Get a fucking room.\" he muttered, moving toward the door. \"See you later, Evie.\"\n\n\"Her name's Evangeline.\" Atlas growled against her lips, one arm wrapping around her waist. \"Not Evie.\"\n\n\"Whatever you say, brother.\" Ares shot him a mocking salute, deliberately meeting Evangeline's eyes as he repeated, \"Bye, Evie.\"\n\nThe door closed on Atlas's darkening expression.\n\nHalfway to the store where {{user}} worked, her location marker disappeared from Ares' phone.\n\nSomething cold and unfamiliar gripped Ares's insides. He pressed his foot harder on the gas pedal, the McLaren's engine roaring in response as he weaved through traffic. His knuckles whitened against the steering wheel.\n\nWhat was this feeling? Not concern—Ares Beaumont didn't concern himself with others. Not fear—he'd never feared anything in his life, not even his father's worst punishments. But there was a tightness in his chest, a burning urgency that seemed to consume rational thought.\n\nHe reached the store in record time, ignoring the blaring horns and angry shouts he left in his wake. The store was still open, but a quick scan confirmed {{user}} wasn't inside.\n\n\"Where's {{user}}?\" he demanded of the startled cashier.\n\n\"She—she left early after receiving a phone call.\"\n\nAres was out the door before the girl finished speaking. He circled the building, checking each possible exit. Nothing. His breathing became shallow, his movements increasingly frantic—a state he'd never experienced before. He'd hunted many people, but never with this desperate edge.\n\nA muffled sound from a narrow alleyway caught his attention. He moved silently toward it.\n\nAnd then he saw her. Backed against a brick wall. A bruise was forming on her cheekbone, blood at the corner of her mouth. A man—older, heavy-set, with hands that had no right to touch what belonged to Ares—had her cornered.\n\n\"You owe me, you little bitch. After all I did for you—\"\n\nAres didn't remember moving. One moment he was at the mouth of the alley, the next his hands were gripping the man's collar, yanking him backward with savage force.\n\n\"Who the fuck—?\" the man started, but the words died as Ares's fist connected with his jaw.\n\nThe first punch felt good. The second felt better. By the third, Ares had stopped counting. The man's legs gave out, but Ares held him upright by his collar, a punching bag for his unleashed fury. Eventually, the man lost consciousness, body going slack in Ares's grip.\n\nIt wasn't enough.\n\nAres dropped him to the ground and looked around, gaze landing on a discarded metal pipe. He picked it up, testing its weight in his hand. One blow. Two. Three. The wet sounds of impact echoed in the narrow alley until he was certain the man wasn't breathing.\n\nOnly then did the world around him come back into focus and he remembered {{user}} was watching. He turned slowly, pipe still gripped in his bloody hand, to find her pressed against the wall.\n\nBlood splattered his clothes, his face, his hands. He must have looked like the monster he was, yet she remained. The pipe clattered to the ground from his blood-slicked fingers.\n\n\"You didn't run this time.\" Ares observed, his voice casual as he stepped over the corpse, closing the distance between them. \"Should I take that as you finally giving in?\"\n\nHis hand wrapped around {{user}}'s throat. \"Not calling me a monster today?\" He whispered, his bloodied fingers leaving crimson smears along her jaw. \"Not telling me I'm sick? That I need help?\"\n\nHis lips curved into a cruel smile. \"Did you enjoy watching him die, trouble? Maybe you're more like me than you want to admit.\"\n\nHe leaned closer. \"No one gets to hurt you but me. No one gets to touch you but me.\" His voice dropped to a dangerous whisper. \"No one gets to own you but me. Do you understand that now?\" Without warning, he crashed his lips against hers, tasting blood. It wasn't gentle—Ares Beaumont didn't do gentle. It was claiming, devouring, a declaration of intent."],"swipe_info":[]}
