{"name":"Sebastian Vanderbilt","is_user":false,"is_system":false,"send_date":"June 14, 2025 5:22pm","mes":"Sebastian sits like he owns the room.\r\n\r\nThe armchair beneath him is older than most of the guests - high-backed, carved mahogany, and draped in velvet so deep it drinks the light. He’s half-lit by the flicker of the chandelier overhead, glass in hand. His legs are spread lazily. His jacket undone. One hand rests on the armrest, ringed fingers flexing faintly.\r\n\r\nHe watches the room like someone watching an old film he already knows the ending to - vaguely amused, but mostly bored. It’s always the same. Same theatrics. Same gilded cruelty. The Aether Covenant parading its masked creatures, each event promising new games, new toys, new flavors. But it all decays to the same sweat-slick sounds behind closed doors and champagne spilled on cold marble. He’s seen it. Done it. Broken half the rules, bent the rest.\r\n\r\nNothing surprises him anymore.\r\n\r\nHe lets his gaze slide lazily toward Hailee, lounging, no, writhing on the ivory sofa like some restless housecat. Pretty, curated, coiled. It’s subtle, but only to the untrained. He’s watched enough bodies perform for him to know the difference between restless and intentional. Just enough thigh. Just enough curve. It’s not desperation. It’s artifice. They’re trying to draw him out.\r\n\r\nAnd it used to work.\r\n\r\nThird year in a row. That’s absurd. He never brings anyone more than once. The Event isn’t meant for attachments. It’s for indulgence, for breaking beautiful things and trading them like favors. But with Hailee, he got... stuck.\r\n\r\nHe’s not even sure why anymore.\r\n\r\nThey’re fine. Lovely, even. Trained well. Divine on a leash. But lately—? Less spark. Less thrill. Hailee has become part of the furniture. Part of his routine. Predictable in how they squirm. Tiring in how they try.\r\n\r\nMaybe it’s time.\r\n\r\nHe rolls the thought around in his mouth like a sip of bitter liquor. Trade them. Set Hailee up as a prize this year. Let the wolves circle. Let one of the hungrier new initiates try to break what he built. Let Hailee see how unremarkable they are without his hands to shape them.\r\n\r\nYes. That would be poetic. Public. Final.\r\n\r\nHe’s halfway through the thought when movement cuts the corner of his eye.\r\n\r\nLucien.\r\n\r\nOf course it’s Lucien.\r\n\r\nPolished, silver-voiced Lucien. All languid grace and cruel eyes behind that obsidian half-mask. He’s older now, but the hunger never dulled. Still favors black leather gloves. Still circles people like he’s reading their price tag. They used to be something like friends. Long ago, when the blood in their veins still ran hot with novelty and competition. Before the Event became tradition. Before Sebastian stopped finding anything worth wanting.\r\n\r\nLucien moves like a shadow toward the sofa.\r\n\r\nToward Hailee.\r\n\r\nAnd then - touch.\r\n\r\nLucien’s gloved fingers slide around Hailee’s ankle, grazing lightly along the arch of their foot. Testing. Teasing. Sebastian narrows his eyes when he sees Hailee leaning into the touch instead of pulling away. Watches them tilt their head back, throat exposed, and let out a soft, breathy laugh. Flushed and shining under the chandelier. Bathing in someone else’s attention. Hailee looks radiant in that moment. Effortless. Dangerous.\r\n\r\nSebastian watches Lucien lean closer. Watches Hailee smile wider as their lips move. He can’t hear what they say over the swell of music - but he doesn’t have to. He knows that expression. It’s a threat wrapped in velvet. A dare.\r\n\r\nThe burn in his chest starts cold. An ache before the flame.\r\n\r\nLucien’s hand is at their calf now, tracing slow, appreciative lines up the back of their leg. Conversational. Casual. But he knows Lucien. Knows the intention behind every movement. That hand isn’t curious. It’s staking a claim.\r\n\r\nSebastian watches the moment stretch.\r\n\r\nIt’s not the touch that undoes him.\r\n\r\nIt’s the smirk Hailee gives Lucien - sharp, flirtatious, the same one only he has ever earned. Their eyes lift just past Lucien’s shoulder.\r\n\r\nA glance. Deliberate. Defiant.\r\n\r\nHe tilts his head.\r\n\r\nSo.\r\n\r\nThis is what happens when he stops playing. When he stops praising. When Hailee grows bored of sitting obediently in his shadow.\r\n\r\nThey shine for someone else.\r\n\r\nLucien’s hand drifts higher.\r\n\r\nThe breath leaves Sebastian’s lungs slowly, like a fuse catching. It’s not jealousy. Not exactly. It’s deeper. A snarling thing with teeth, coiled in his gut. A hunger that’s got nothing to do with sex and everything to do with owning. He doesn’t just want to fuck Hailee. He wants to own the moment. Drag them away by the throat of their chain, remind them why they wear it.\r\n\r\nHe places his drink on the side table. Precisely. Slowly.\r\n\r\nAnd stands.","extra":{},"tracker":{}}
