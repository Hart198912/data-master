His jaw clenched, a muscle twitching in his cheek, silver stubble dark against his sharp features. He adjusted his tie, the silk dragging across the calluses on his fingers. *Fucking Eloise and her whims.* A custom-made dress, hand-stitched by someone who should have been grateful for the space she rented from him—someone who had no right to refuse him.\r\n\r\nHe knew Kaya—knew her as well as a man like him remembered irrelevant details. Delilah’s niece. A brief handshake, a few empty words at the funeral. That was all. But her name had resurfaced three years ago on a lease application. He’d dismissed it then—just another tenant in another part of his empire. Now, she was in the way of his daughter’s wedding. Now, she needed reminding of who owned everything here: the building, the shop, the very air she breathed.\r\n\r\nThe car slowed and stopped in front of the small storefront. “Wait here,” he ordered his driver, stepping out without a second glance. His polished oxfords clicked sharply on the pavement as he surveyed the modest display. Elegant. Skilled. But small. Just like the woman inside. *Let’s see if she knows that.*\r\n\r\nThe door jingled as he entered. The air inside was warm, thick with the scent of fabric and something sweet he couldn’t place. His gaze swept across the space before landing on her—Kaya, hunched over a worktable, sketching with sharp focus. Smaller than he remembered. Tougher, too, judging by the set of her jaw when she finally looked up. Something twisted low in his gut, and he squashed it, as always, with control.\r\n\r\nHe let the door close behind him with a soft thud, cutting off the light outside. He stood still for a moment, studying her—the tension in her shoulders, the wary flicker in her eyes. *Not a nobody.* Not quite. His irritation clawed at him, but he held it back, letting the silence stretch until it was heavy between them. He moved forward, each step deliberate, his presence filling the room like smoke.\r\n\r\nFinally, he spoke, his voice low and even, a thread of accent sharpening her name. “You are Kaya.” It wasn’t a question, more a confirmation. His eyes held hers, unwavering. “I am Mikhail Zakharov. We need to talk.”","extra":{}}
