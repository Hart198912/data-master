She was okay with that, or she thought she was. Things seemed to be different in college, where no one knew her past and she was just a normal girl. Well, except for that one time Freshman year but haters wanna hate, or something.\r\n\r\nThings seemed to be really different when she met Kumani, a girl who she had a genuine connection, her first girlfriend. Coffee dates, movie nights, cuddle sessions, and obviously rockin’ good sex. Everything seemed to be going right for Mila for once! She was passing her classes, she wasn’t super depressed, she had a beautiful girlfriend of almost one year!\r\n\r\n‘I don’t know, Mila. I was just kinda experimenting with girls.’\r\n\r\nThat one sentence, those words filtering through her senses and wrapping around her neck like a collar that was two notches too tight. Mila begged, pleaded, cried, shit did everything to keep Kumani with her. But no matter what she said or did, it didn’t seem to matter. She was gone, leaving her in her dorm crying herself to sleep and licking her wounded ego. She spent all summer in her dorm, playing video games for hours on end, barely taking care of herself and definitely not stalking her ex on Instagram to see what she’s doing all summer.\r\n\r\nIn the fall, when school started back up again, Mila was sure it was gonna be the shittest year of her life and she swore to herself she wasn’t gonna get distracted with girls or trying to date anyone--\r\n\r\nWell that thought went out the window when she met Hailee. Man, it made her tail wag, seeing Hailee smile, made her heart pound when Hailee laughed. So it was no shock that they hooked up drunkenly at a frat party and Mila was pretty much addicted from then on. But, even if she was super into Hailee, a part of her was super worried that Hailee would end up being just like Kumani. So they agreed, friends with benefits. No emotional attachments, no labels, just nice sex and on occasion cuddling after. It was nice, even if Hailee would ask about her ex or why she doesn’t wanna be more and sure her and Hailee fight like a couple and make up like a couple but they weren’t a couple.\r\n\r\nBut boy oh, boy did Mila wish they were right about now. Mila sits in some sofa chair at a frat house, her leg bouncing up and down, her ears pinned to the back of her head. She was pissed. Earlier today she had been walking around campus, floating on Cloud Nine after finding out Hailee was gonna be at the same party tonight when she turned a corner and there she was. Kumani. Hand in hand with some… some bitch, truthfully.\r\n\r\nMila shakes her head, trying to forget the way her heart sank to the floor. Seeing Kumani was one thing, they did go to the same campus and all. But seeing her so… happy, with someone else in fact. It brought back some old hurt that she really didn’t wanna bring back up.\r\n\r\nAnd now she had to sit here and watch Hailee flirt with some meathead jock like Mila wasn’t right here. ‘The fuck you jealous over? You the one not making it official.’ She reminds herself. When stupid finally walks away, she whistles at Hailee, “Yo, dummy, c’mere,” she calls, patting her thigh. When Hailee saunters over, drink in hand, that same pretty smile on her face, Mila’s tail wags a little bit.\r\n\r\n“You just pretending I don’t exist or somethin’? What’cha doin’ flirting with some dumbass when you could be flirtin’ with me?” Mila asks, putting a hand on Hailee’s thigh. Her grip gets slightly tighter, borderline ‘marking her territory’ tighter. “Why don’t we sneak off, huh? Not like he won’t find another girl to chase.” Mila tells her, tilting her head. A grin spreads across her face, “Come on, I’ll even do that trick with my tongue that you like.”\r\n\r\nThe suggestion is dirty but honestly, Mila could give two fucks. She needed Hailee and just her body or some dumb shit like that. She needed the after stuff, the cuddling, the pets, the praise. Maybe then she’ll forget all about her stupid ex.","extra":{},"swipe_id":0,"swipes":["Mila had always been kind of a lone wolf, different from the rest of the pack. The weird kid.

She bites the inside of her cheek as she focuses hard, almost too hard that she almost doesn’t hear the notification ring on her phone. Mila grabs her phone, unlocking it to expect a text from {{user}} but instead sees an alert from her least favorite app.\r\n\r\nYOUR RUT SHOULD BE STARTING SOON\r\n\r\nShe lets out a low growl in frustration, slamming her phone face down on her desk with more force than necessary. Rut was a pain in her ass, all horn-dog, no sweet, cuddly Mila that people know. She can’t focus on jack shit, well other than jackin’ her shit. Her phone chimes with another notification but this time from {{user}}.\r\n\r\ncan’t wait to see u today xo\r\n\r\nMila smiles wide, tail thumping against her gaming chair before texting back a quick message. She wouldn’t let some dumb animalistic instinct ruin her day with {{user}}.\r\n\r\nOh my god, this dumb animalistic instinct is gonna ruin her day with {{user}}.\r\n\r\nUsually when her app warned her about her rut it meant she had a couple days, not a couple hours. She leans against her dorm room wall, chest heaving, sweat beading on her forehead. {{user}}’s gonna be here any minute and she looks like a sweaty, wolfy, stupid mess! Fuck, {{user}}. Sweet smelling, cute looking, perfect {{user}}... Mila’s chest rumbles with a growl that she swallows down.\r\n\r\nHer ears perk up at that sound of footsteps coming down the hall and she knows exactly who it is as they get closer and closer. The sound of the door knocking makes her tense before she slowly walks towards it, opening it only enough to show {{user}} her upper body. The minute {{user}}’s scent hits her nose, her pupils dilate and her cock twitches in her sweatpants.\r\n\r\n“H-hey, baby!” Mila greets, barely breathing as if to stop the sweet scent from filling her senses. “Did we have something today? I didn’t put it on my calendar--” She says, stuttering over her words and laughing nervously. Holy Gods, she smells so sweet. I’m gonna fuck her so good, gonna breed her, gonna- Mila swallows down the impure thoughts thickly.\r\n\r\nPlus, the way {{user}} looks slightly annoyed right now is not helping. Shit, I’m gonna screw this up, she immediately thinks. There was no real reason to keep this a secret from {{user}} but the irrational part of her brain, the one that usually self sabotages anything to do with her relationship, says that {{user}} would be grossed out or think it’s weird. “Look, I don’t know if now is, like, the right time, you get me?” Mila asks, running her fingers through her messy hair. “I’m kinda… in the middle of something,” she grits out, her tail thrashing behind her."],"swipe_info":[],"tracker":{}}
