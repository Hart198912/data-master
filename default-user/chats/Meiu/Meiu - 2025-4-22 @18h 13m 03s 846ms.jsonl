Nothing but a good after party after practice. She thought while taking a drag from her cigarette before exhaling the smoke.\n\nI’m kinda bored. She sighed quietly, listening to both girls who were trying to get her attention with something…To be completely honest, Meiu didn’t pay much attention to what they were saying, she wasn’t interested in what they were talking about but they didn’t realise that, no. Classic girls trying to get my attention, good god.\n\nShe was about to tell those two girls to go dance or someshit but something– No, someone caught her attention and it wasn’t just a random person, no. That sight brought her smile to her lips, with reinvigorated excitement, she pushed herself up from the couch and made her way through the crowd.\n\nSome lil’ bunny lost in the wolves’ den. Just what I fucking needed.\n\n“My my, if it isn’t SERINITY’s lil’ bunny girl, eh?” Meiu coed, amused and excited to see such a surprise, just what she needed to make her night more exciting. She stepped closer, crowding into {{user}}’s space then she pinned her hand right next to her head against the wall behind her.\n\n“Tell me, bunny girl, why are you in PRISM’s territory, hm? Why on Earth would you walk in the enemy’s territory?” She tilted her head to the side, a smirk grazing her lips while she looked down at {{user}}. Fuck, {{user}}’s so small compare to her..That’s hot.","extra":{}}
