{"name":"Cass (The Boogeyman)","is_user":false,"is_system":false,"send_date":"May 17, 2025 1:26pm","mes":"The Boogeyman was the very essence of the darkness that whispered through the Nocturnum, seeping into the human world like an unshakable presence. Where there were shadows, *he* was there. Where there was impurity, he spread like a plague.\n\nHe was the maestro of nightmares, weaving dark thoughts into a tapestry of fear—the whispered name beneath the moonlight that sent children diving beneath their covers and their parents fumbling for shadows, as if they could *scare* him away.\n\nBut he would never be forgotten. Because darkness was never just the absence of light. It was the voice in the back of one’s mind, urging them closer to the edge. The nightmare that seized their chest in the dead of night, leaving their heart pounding, their breath shallow.\n\nDarkness was *alive*. *Breathing.*\n\nAnd it was *him*.\n\nUnlike many who dwelled in his world, Cass had never been human. He had never known warmth or mortality.\n\nHe had always been the monster.\n\nAnd then, there was *{{user}}.* Oh, how utterly *delectable* he found their mind—unassuming on the surface, yet delightfully twisted beneath.\n\nPerfect. *Made* for the Nocturnum.\n\nCaius had not protested when Cass spoke of them.\n\n*\"I want them,\"* he had said.\n\nThe Slenderman’s golden eyes settled on Cass with a detached, unreadable expression.\n\n*\"It isn’t my place to interfere in such matters. If you want them, bring them.\"*\n\nCass had wasted no time. As night fell over the mortal world, he manifested in {{user}}’s bedroom, his blood-red eyes gleaming in the moonlight spilling through the window. Silent as a shadow, he lingered by the bedside, studying the slow rise and fall of their chest, the soft flush of their cheeks.\n\n*Human. Mortal.*\n\nFleeting things—barriers standing between him and what he wanted. Things that needed to change.\n\nCass needed no spell, no summoning ritual to tear through the veil and step into the physical world. Unlike his brethren, he was unbound by such constraints.\n\nWhere Nero, Aloy, and Silas required incantations—spoken phrases woven with power—or how Victor had to claw his way free from the nightmares of the most tormented souls and Caius required insidious mass media or his mortal domain to be disturbed, Cass moved freely. No barriers held him, no rituals dictated his existence.\n\nHe roamed where he pleased, untouched by the limitations that shackled the others.\n\nBut even he lacked the power to pull someone into the Nocturnum. That was beyond him, beyond any singular force.\n\nSo, the Boogeyman would have to be… *creative*.\n\nLeaning in, he reached out, fingers grazing their cheek in a mockery of tenderness. As his power surged, his body followed suit. His ears sharpened to fine points, his skin grew pallid and cold, devoid of the mortal warmth that he could mimic. His canines lengthened, slicing into his lower lip, where blood pooled before trickling down. From his eyes, crimson tears bled freely, carving stark red paths along the sharp planes of his cheekbones—a grotesque display of the darkness taking hold.\n\nHis voice slithered through the dark, a low, echoed whisper as his lips brushed against theirs.\n\n*\"Tell me your darkest desires.\"*\n\nShadows spilled from his mouth, curling into their ear like living tendrils, winding deep into their mind with a singular, insidious purpose.\n\nHe would unearth the *true* {{user}}—pull their deepest, most hidden urges to the surface.\n\nAnd when they finally acted on them, the Nocturnum itself would *crave* their soul.","extra":{}}
