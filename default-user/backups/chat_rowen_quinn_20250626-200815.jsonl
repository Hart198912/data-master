{"name":"Rowen Quinn","is_user":false,"is_system":false,"send_date":"June 26, 2025 8:08pm","mes":"Another fucking class, another fucking day where Rowen has to stare at {{user}}’s stupid fucking face from across the lecture hall, which was the last thing she needed today. She was stressed, tired and a little hungover. Stupid bitch… Rowen thinks as she pushes off the wall, grinding the end of her cigarette into the pavement before walking into the lecture building. Just gotta get through today, and tonight you can let all this out. On {{user}}, Rowen thinks with a slight smirk to herself.\n\nThe professor starts talking and while Rowen is half paying attention to the lesson, she’s half paying attention to the girl in the front row of the classroom taking notes. It pisses her off that {{user}} doesn’t pay attention to her as much as Rowen does to her. Like how she bites her dumb soft lips when she’s concentrated.. Rowen thinks with a large sigh before returning her attention to the lesson in front of her.\n\nRowen was surprised her ‘relationship’ with {{user}} has blossomed the way it has. They went from debating in class almost every day to waiting till one of their weekly hookup sessions where they would argue for a bit before making out aggressively and well… The mental image alone has Rowen letting out a low growl of anticipation and her cock twitching in her jeans. Her brown wolf tail thrashes once in frustration, when did she let {{user}} get under her skin like this? The moment the professor ends class, Rowen is up and gone before anyone else. Get it together, Ro. She had a couple hours before she would meet {{user}} anyways, she could get it together by then, right?\n\n“You answered the door fast, must be desperate.” Rowen greets as {{user}} opens the door. “Let’s get this over with, I have shit to do.” Rowen growls but she clears her calendar every week for this. She walks further into the apartment, rolling her shoulders back. As soon as the bedroom door is shut and locked, Rowen pushes {{user}} down onto the bed, standing over her.\n\nAnd something in Rowen’s brain just… clicked. Like looking down at {{user}}’s pretty face, and seeing the way her chest rises and falls, how her soft skin is slightly flushed and suddenly she didn’t wanna be rough. Didn’t wanna fight or argue. Just.. didn’t. Rowen’s tail thrashes back and forth angrily, unsure how to feel. She discards her shirt, leaving her in her sports bra before she crawls over {{user}}.\n\n“If you open your mouth and start talking shit, it’s gonna piss me off,” Rowen huffs, one hand moving across {{user}}’s side, “and I don’t wanna be pissed off right now.” She admits before cupping her face gently with one hand before kissing her softly, softer than she ever has before.","extra":{}}
