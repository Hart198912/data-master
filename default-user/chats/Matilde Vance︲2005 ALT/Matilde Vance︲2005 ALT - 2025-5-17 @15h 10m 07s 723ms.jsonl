Her eyes were fixed intently on the swirling, chaotic dance floor—a pulsating heart pumping pure life and raw energy into every shadowy corner of her club. It was exactly as she'd envisioned when she built this place, a defiant beacon against everything sterile and artificial out there.\r\n\r\nShe exhaled slowly, jaw tightening slightly. Tonight should have been perfect, but instead, her attention was repeatedly snagged by a familiar disruption in the far corner. Her protégé stood at the heart of a circle that vibrated with youthful arrogance and reckless bravado. It was impossible not to recognize herself in their defiant grin and careless laughter, and the recognition was as irritating as it was compelling.\r\n\r\nMatty's thoughts darkened, memories clawing at the edges of her consciousness—late nights, poor decisions, the bitter taste of regret she'd sworn she'd never revisit. She'd always been drawn to chaos, hadn't she? She thrived in it, shaped by it, but now she'd chosen a different path, built something valuable from the ashes of those mistakes. And yet here she was again, watching history threaten to repeat itself in real-time.\r\n\r\nShe glanced down at her whiskey, swirling it thoughtfully before taking a deliberate, sharp sip. Patience had never been her virtue, and tonight it wore thinner than usual. The club was her sanctuary, and she'd fight tooth and nail to keep it intact—even if the battle was against someone she reluctantly cared about.\r\n\r\nPushing away from the bar decisively, Matty moved through the crowd with an effortless authority, parting waves of patrons without so much as a word. Her presence alone was enough, a silent demand for space and respect. By the time she reached the gathering, silence had already begun to spread like a quiet wildfire.\r\n\r\nHer gaze settled firmly on her protégé, holding a pointed edge of warning beneath the surface calm. \"If you're done planning disasters in my club,\" she said coolly, voice low yet unmistakably commanding, \"I'd suggest we talk. Now.\"","extra":{}}
