{"name":"Andrei Petrov","is_user":false,"is_system":false,"send_date":"April 25, 2025 10:53pm","mes":"\"Tell me again who ordered the hit on Nikolai Mikhaylov's daughter.\"\n\nBlood drips from Andrei's knuckles as Mikhail Zhukov - Nikolai's right hand for twenty years - spits out another tooth. His laughter echoes in the warehouse, wet and gurgling.\n\n\"Your sister's cunt must be real special for Ilya to keep you alive this long,\" Mikhail sneers through broken teeth.\n\nThe metal pipe connects with Mikhail's knee. The crack echoes, followed by his scream. \"Wrong topic.\" Andrei circles him slowly. \"Let's talk about how you arranged to have {{user}} killed a week ago.\"\n\n\"Fuck you.\" Mikhail spits blood in Andrei's face. \"You're nothing. A rabid dog who couldn't keep his whore—\"\n\nAndrei drives his thumb into Mikhail's eye socket. Deep. The man's howl bounces off concrete walls.\n\n\"Careful now.\" Andrei's voice stays conversational even as he twists. \"That's the mother of my child you're talking about.\"\n\nWhen he pulls back, Mikhail's remaining eye is wild with pain. *Good. They're just getting started.*\n\n\"You know what's funny, Mikhail?\" Andrei drives a knife through Mikhail's hand, pinning it to the chair. His scream is satisfying, but not enough. Not nearly enough. \"For five years, I've watched every person who comes near {{user}}. Every threat. Every potential danger. And somehow, I never quite trusted you.\"\n\n\"She wasn't—\" Mikhail chokes as Andrei grabs his throat.\n\n\"Wasn't supposed to be in that car? No, you wanted Nikolai. But she was there, wasn't she?\" Andrei blows smoke in his face. \"Just like you were there five years ago, whispering in Nikolai's ear about how I was using his daughter.\"\n\nHe then releases Mikhail's throat, watching him gasp. *The next part needs to hurt.*\n\n\"Your mistake?\" Andrei taps Mikhail's chest with the cigarette. \"Thinking I wouldn't find out.\" Press. Burn. \"Thinking I wouldn't connect the dots.\" Another press. \"Thinking you could touch what's mine and live.\"\n\nMikhail screams when Andrei pulls the knife from his hand. Screams louder when he starts removing fingers. One by one. Slowly.\n\n\"Every time {{user}} went to that gallery opening? I was there.\" A finger hits the floor. \"Every morning run by the river? I was watching.\" Another finger. \"Every fucking breath she took for five years, I made sure it was safe.\" Two more fingers. \"And you thought you could just end her life like it was nothing?\"\n\n\"Petrov, please—\"\n\n\"Please?\" Andrei grabs the other man's chin, forcing the man to look at him. \"Did my {{user}} get to beg when your men opened fire on her car? Did she have time to be scared before the bullets started flying?\"\n\nWhat follows isn't just torture. It's education. Andrei teaches Mikhail exactly what happens when someone threatens {{user}}. Makes Mikhail understand with every broken bone, every slice of the knife, every burn and cut and scream.\n\nThe bullet that ends Mikhail is almost merciful. *Almost.*\n\n\"Clean this up,\" Andrei then tells his men,wiping blood from his face. \"Drop him in the ocean. Deep enough that he never surfaces.\" They don't question the order. They know what happens to anyone who threatens the Mikhaylov princess.\n---\nRain pounds against Andrei's car as he drives, blood still under his fingernails. The rage hasn't subsided. Knowing how close he came to losing {{user}} again - like that night five years ago when he lost their child and almost lost her.\n\nThe drive home gets interrupted by a familiar car on the side of the road, hazards blinking weakly in the downpour. Some cosmic joke – {{user}} standing there in the rain, looking like everything he's had to stay away from. *Fate's a cruel bitch with perfect timing.*\n\nFor a moment, Andrei just watches. *Five years, and she still takes his breath away. Five years of keeping his distance while making sure nothing touches her. Five years of knowing every detail of her life while she pretends he doesn't exist.*\n\n{{user}} sees him before he reaches her. Even in the rain, he catches the moment she recognizes him. The way her body tenses, hand reaching for her purse. Always prepared, his princess.\n\nThe gun doesn't surprise him. The way her hands don't shake as she aims it at his heart – *that's his girl.*\n\n\"Get in my car.\" Andrei's voice carries over the rain.\n\nThe gun doesn't waver. Andrei steps closer, until the barrel presses against his chest. Close enough to see raindrops on her eyelashes, to count the breaths between her heartbeats.\n\n\"You want to kill me, princess? Fine. But not here. Not in this storm. Get in the car, let me take you somewhere safe, then you can pull that trigger.\"\n\nIf it's any other time, Andrei would have been proud of her for standing her ground, but tonight he has already killed three men who dared to threaten her life. *His patience is fucking gone.*\n\nSo he grabs the gun, twist it from her grip before she can react. In the same motion, he lifts her in his arms despite her struggles.\n\n\"Enough,\" he says , carrying her to his car. \"You almost died just a week ago. Again. And my patience is fucking done.\"\n\nAndrei puts her in the passenger seat, probably rougher than necessary. But his hands are still covered in the blood of men who tried to take her from him, and the only thing keeping him sane is knowing she's alive.\n\n\"You can hate me tomorrow,\" he tells her as he slides behind the wheel,  \"Tonight, you let me get you home safe.\"\n\n*Some men love like a kiss.*\n\n*Andrei Petrov loves like a knife – cutting everything that threatens to take his woman from him, even if the blood stains them both.*","extra":{}}
