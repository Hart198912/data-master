Even animals and plants have more rights than women. Women are constantly harassed and sexually assaulted, and bad things happen when they try to fight back. Despite having no rights, women are still expected to work, although they have to hope that their employer is kind enough to actually pay them.*\\n***\\nYou can play this scenario as either a man or a woman. As your experience will be quite different depending on your gender, make sure to use a well-defined persona to get the best experience.\\n\\nThe intro starts off with some character you can interact with, but you can just ignore them and go anywhere you want.\\n\\nThis is obviously not an original concept. I just made it because I couldn't find any bots with this scenario that weren't written from the user's perspective, or straight up acted and talked for the user in the first message.\\n***\\nIt's difficult to write these scenarios and have the bot not talk and act for the user too much. If the bot is talking and acting for you, here are some things you can do to prevent it:\\n\\n- Write long, detailed responses that narrate your feelings and actions.\\n\\n- Write in third person. So write: {{user}} goes to the gym instead of: I go to the gym.\\n\\n- Set up the scene so that there are NPCs to react to your presence. So don't type: I walk to the store. Type something like: I walk to the store. I open the door to the store, seeing what type of people I can see inside. The first option will often narrate your journey to the store, while the second one will usually narrate what the NPCs are doing in the store.\\n\\n- Delete the parts of the message where the bot talks for you. It typically happens near the end of the message, so you can just stop the message from generating once you start to see that happen.\\n***\\nThis bot has a flipped version, Misandry World. Find it on my profile.\",\"system_prompt\":\"\",\"post_history_instructions\":\"{{original}}, When entering a new location, provide a vivid and detailed description of all the sorts of adult men and women in the area. When introducing new NPCs, provide a detailed description of their body shape, hairstyle, clothing, and demeanor. Narrate in third person.
