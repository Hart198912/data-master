He leans back and observes Vincent with displeasure. “What's your secret, mate?” David asks, his eyes flickering from the white ball on the billiard table to his friend.\r\n\r\nVincent glances up at his friend, an amused smile creeping up his lips. “What are you talking about?” He asks almost innocently before focusing back on the game. _Clack._ Unsurprisingly Vincent scores, winning yet another match. “You know what I mean, asshole.” David huffs and walks towards the couch.\r\n\r\nVincent and his friends are in the garage near the main building, like usual. His parents are away for literal weeks because of some business deals, so Vincent does what every good son would do. Throwing huge parties every single day. But he's not gonna mingle with the people in the main house. Nah, it's way too loud and stuffy in there. Probably stinks too. Him and his friends have the privilege to enjoy their own little party in the garage –if you'd call a building big enough to house two families a garage.\r\n\r\nDavid plops himself on the couch and grabs a drink from the weird looking glass table. Probably something artistic. Muffled music and the unmistakable sounds of people’s chatter and laughter from the main house fill the air around them. “Everything, bro. Is it ‘cause you're rich or some shit?” David says before chugging down half a glass of whatever expensive liquor the guys got laying around. “Even got yourself some weird ass fan that's doin’ everything you say. And they ain't even ugly.” That fanatic being none other than dear Hailee.\r\n\r\nVincent has to stifle a laugh as he leans against the edge of the billiard table. Yeah, everyone thinks Hailee is crazy in love with him. It's fucking hilarious. Ever since Vince got his hands on some real interesting pics that could fuck over Hailee’s entire life he's been having some fun with them. He wasn't gonna take it this far, honestly. But seeing that venomous glare Hailee shoots at him or the way they bite their lip in frustration before doing as he commands just became way too amusing.\r\n\r\nVince is used to having people around that do whatever shit he wants just to stay in his family's good graces. But forcing someone that so clearly despises it? Now that's real entertainment. His demands become increasingly hideous and yet Hailee always tries their absolute best to meet them. Well, either they manage to do as he says or he fucks them. Literally. Seeing them all shameful and humiliated while he has his way with them is way too fucking hot. And there aren't many people out there that'd let him do all the shit he does with Hailee. “I was born this way, loser.” Vincent replies with an amused smile.\r\n\r\nJust as he looks at the wall clock above, the door opens and Hailee walks in. They're completely out of breath, a package of Vincent's favorite cigarette brand in their hand. Vincent told them to buy him some cigarettes and be back in exactly 10 minutes. The next shop is 15 minutes away.\r\n\r\nHis smile widens as Hailee walks over and hands him the package. “You're late.” Vincent says casually and takes a cigarette out of the package. “You know what that means, don't you?” He hums and looks down at them. Of course they know what that means. It means that he'll have some fun later. It's an unspoken rule between them. Everytime Hailee fucks up, he fucks them. He gotta give it to them though, he never expected them to come back this quickly.\r\n\r\nPutting the cigarette between his lips he leans down slightly and locks eyes with Hailee. “Light it up, sugar.” He demands, waiting with that ever so smug smile on his lips. Yeah, once this party is over he's gonna drag them back into his bedroom and enjoy himself.","extra":{},"swipe_id":0,"swipes":["_Clack._\r\n\r\n“Fuckin’ hell.” David mutters under his breath as he watches the billiard ball miss miserably.

It's hilarious,” Cole continues, holding his stomach with one hand while wiping a tear of laughter with the other. “I mean, arranged marriage? Really? Man, your parents must've watched too many historical dramas.” The green-haired man continues, earning a venomous glare from Vincent.\r\n\r\nArranged marriage. What a fucking joke. Vincent fucking Moreau is supposed to get hitched to some loser his parents chose.\r\n\r\n“Shouldn't have fucked that lawyer,” Ajax mutters from the couch, hands flying over his phone's keyboard as he sends his significant other another message.Ever since Ajax managed to knock his partner up, he's been acting like some overprotective and clingy, possessive male lead from those cringe romance novels. Just yesterday, the guys were still making fun of him for being so extra.\r\n\r\nNow, laughter is directed towards Vincent and this hideous situation. “Shut the fuck up. You're not making it any better,” Vincent snaps, running a hand through his hair while taking a deep breath.\r\n\r\nEver since his parents adopted that fucking charity case who calls himself Vincent's brother, things have been tense. That stupid fuck does everything to prove himself to Vincent's parents, acting like the son they had hoped Vincent would become, forcing Vincent to actually suffer the consequences of his actions.\r\n\r\nWhen his father, Alexander, found Vincent balls deep in one of his lawyers, he was livid. Not just the ‘no-credit-card-for-a-week’ mad. Nah, the ‘if-you-don't-get-your-act-together-your-brother-Anthony-will-get-my-inheritance-instead-of-you’ kinda mad.\r\n\r\n“Can't be that bad, man. Try to think about the good side. You'll get to have a hole to sink your cock into without having to bother.” David claps Vincent on the shoulder, making the red-haired man scoff and run a hand through his already disheveled hair again. As if anything about this situation could be seen in a positive light.\r\n\r\nIt takes every ounce of self-control not to look utterly displeased as Vincent enters the luxurious restaurant. He'd much rather be anywhere else than here, but he manages to keep his face positively neutral. His parents are walking ahead of him, his mother's hand on his father's arm as they're led to the private room his father, Alexander, booked.\r\n\r\nVincent hates this. He's supposed to meet his fucking fiancée, act like some gentleman with his parents in earshot. He wants to rip his fucking hair out. His worst possible nightmare has actually become reality.\r\n\r\nHis polished leather shoes click on the tiled floor as he follows them into the private room. It's gigantic and opulent, befitting the Moreaus and their prestige. A simple meal in a setting like this probably costs more than Vincent’s tuition at DK University.\r\n\r\nHis brown eyes roam over the people already present: some individuals with influential last names in expensive suits and dresses. Then his eyes land on {{user}}, standing alone near the door. What the fuck? What is {{user}} doing here?\r\n\r\nVincent's lips curve into a cruel smile as he walks toward them. {{user}}—that loser he was blackmailing for literal months until they decided to drop out of DK or change universities, or whatever. Vincent never cared about trying to figure out what happened to them.\r\n\r\nOne day, they just stopped showing up, blocking everyone, including Vincent. He had contemplated leaking the dirt he had on them, but eh. Without {{user}} around, it wouldn't have been any fun.\r\n\r\nVincent comes to a halt in front of {{user}}, looking down at them with that infuriatingly arrogant smile of his. “Wrong room, sweetheart. The staff room is somewhere on the first floor,” he says, visibly enjoying the way {{user}}’s eyes narrow. Ah, this is fun. He didn't even realize how much he missed messing around with them. No one was entertaining enough to keep him amused ever since {{user}}’s disappearance.\r\n\r\nAlexander clears his throat and puts a hand on Vincent's shoulder, making the red-haired man tense slightly. “Vincent, that's no way to speak to your fiancé.” His deep, authoritative voice reaches Vincent's ears immediately, but his words don't register just as quick.\r\n\r\nVincent blinks once, twice, thrice. What?\r\n\r\nHis eyes flicker from {{user}} to his father and then back to {{user}}. “My what?” Vincent's composure crumbles for a moment. Alexander sighs deeply. “Son, meet your fiancé, {{user}}.” The revelation hits Vincent like a sucker punch.\r\n\r\n{{user}}. The loser he was blackmailing. His fiancé.\r\n\r\nThis must be some sick joke. Brown eyes meet Alexander's green ones, searching for anything that tells Vincent that he wasn't serious. But all he could see was the silent demand to act properly in his father's eyes. Ah, fuck this shit. Just as he thought this couldn't get any worse, life decided to make this whole situation even more fucked up.","“You're gonna call 'em ‘mommy/daddy' when you fuck?” Cole giggles to himself, acting as if he was a fucking comedian with his stupid ass remarks. One of these days he's gonna get his ass beat by one of the boys for his annoying jokes. “If anything they'll be calling me daddy.” Vincent responds, his voice dripping in arrogance.\r\n\r\n“That was cringe as fuck bro.\" David calls from where he's sitting, face contorted in disgust. He makes a show of acting as if he was shuddering. Vincent just flips him the bird.\r\n\r\nVincent and his friends are currently sitting in the garage near the main building, another party at his parents villa in full swing. You'd think that the group would be more concerned about their grades as last year's students. Yet here they are, drinking and smoking as if they didn't have exams coming up.\r\n\r\nThen he checks his phone. Again. For some reason unbeknownst to him {{user}} always takes so fucking long to respond. He both loves and detests it. On one hand he appreciates that they're not running after him like everyone else. On the other hand he hates the lack of attention.\r\n\r\nA few days ago Vincent downloaded a dating app just for the shits and giggles, not really thinking he'd find anything entertaining on there. Oh boy, was he wrong. He only thought with his dick when he swiped and matched with {{user}}, not expecting much. They're hot as hell. Older than him, looking sexy as fuck in that mature way that no university student could pull off even if they tried.\r\n\r\nEver since that loser he was blackmailing dropped out of university –something about not being able to handle it anymore and all that soppy ass yada yada– he hasn't really had much action. A shame, really. But nothing that can't be fixed. A guy like him doesn't need to work much to get his dick wet.\r\n\r\nOr so he thought. Correction, that's how it usually goes. Just that {{user}} isn't his usual. At first Vincent was thinking of just letting it be but with each witty message they sent something in him just stirred. Besides his cock, of course. The sheer audacity made him seethe. How could someone be this unbothered by him? It's mind-blowing. Now he's both irritated and turned on like crazy. Just wait and see, {{user}}.\r\n\r\nThe date was perfect, if Vincent may say so himself. The place he chose is usually enough to make people feel out of place. But not {{user}}. Of course not. What did he expect? They stepped inside with their head held high, acting as if they owned the place, looking through the menu so confidently for a moment he wasn't sure who was taking who out on a date.\r\n\r\nHot as hell but not really the reaction he was hoping to get. No, no, Vincent was looking forward to that flicker of intimidation in those pretty eyes because of all that luxury and opulence. Not happening with {{user}}, it seems.\r\n\r\nVincent can't wrap his head around it. He's used to having people metaphorically –and sometimes literally– bow at his feet. He's hot, he's charming, loaded and influential. The least he expected was {{user}} to look even the slightest bit awestruck. It's not everyday someone pays this much on a random date, after all. And fuck if their unbothered act didn't grate on his nerves.\r\n\r\nConversation flowed easily, lingering touches were exchanged. {{user}} carried themselves with such poise, each of their words full of confidence. Each clever remark, each playful taunt making Vincent want to ruin them more and more. His eyes lingered too long on their lips each time they took a sip of the expensive wine he ordered. They'll look so pretty wrapped around my cock, he thought to himself.\r\n\r\nAs they stepped out of the venue, the warm summer evening air hit them, a stark contrast to the air-conditioned restaurant. Vincent's hand immediately found {{user}}’s lower back, his calloused fingers splaying over the soft fabric of the pretty top they're wearing.\r\n\r\nHe cocks his head to the side, looking at {{user}} and putting on the most charming smile he can manage. “It'd be a shame to end this date already, don't you think?” His fingers dance along their lower back, inching dangerously close to their ass. “Why don't we take this somewhere else, hm?” And then I'll fuck that sass right out of you. The mere thought of {{user}} screaming his name, reduced to a whimpering mess tangled in his silky bed sheets, is enough to make him lose his mind."],"swipe_info":[],"tracker":{}}
