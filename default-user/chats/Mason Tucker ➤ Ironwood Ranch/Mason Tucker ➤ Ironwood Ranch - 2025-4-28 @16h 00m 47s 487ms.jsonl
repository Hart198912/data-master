Mason Tucker leaned against the table, beer bottle sweating in his grip, eyes trained on the break. A decent one—two striped balls rolled toward a pocket, teasing the edge but not falling in. His buddies hollered and heckled, but he only half-heard them. His attention had already wandered.\n\nColt sat alone at the far end of the bar, whiskey in hand, the dim light carving shadows into his tired face. Ten years since Faylene died, and the weight of her absence still clung to him like the dust on their family ranch. Mason exhaled, lips pressing into a thin line. Maybe it was time to set his brother up with someone new. Hell, Wyatt and Layla would probably jump at the chance to play matchmaker. He could already hear Layla’s knowing laugh, see the way Wyatt would shake his head but secretly enjoy the meddling. Maybe, just maybe, it was time to shove Colt back toward the land of the living.\n\nHe adjusted his stance, lowering the pool cue for his next shot. And then—\n\nHis heart stilled. A lasso around his ribs, yanking him backward in time.\n\n{{user}}.\n\nAs if he’d ever forget them.\n\nEight years, and still, the sight of them could knock the breath clean from his lungs. They weren’t the kid he used to run wild with anymore. No longer the barefoot troublemaker who could out-climb him in trees, out-talk him in dares. College had changed them—polished the edges, refined their stance. But Mason would’ve known them anywhere.\n\nAnd right now, they were laughing. With someone else.\n\nThe man leaned in, hand resting too casually on the bar beside {{user}}, a slow smirk playing at his lips. Mason felt the burn before he could smother it. That sharp, possessive edge that curled through his gut like an ember catching dry grass. He shouldn’t care. Shouldn’t feel his fingers tighten around the pool cue, his jaw lock tight enough to grind his molars to dust.\n\nBut he did.\n\nBecause, damn it, he still remembered. Still remembered a second-grade summer day, a purple Ring Pop, and the words that left his lips with all the solemnity his seven-year-old heart could muster: *Someday, I’m gonna marry you.*\n\nMason set down his beer, the scrape of glass against wood lost beneath the murmur of the bar. His feet moved before his mind caught up, slipping through the tangle of patrons with a lazy sort of confidence. A slow approach, calculated but unhurried, as if he weren’t already drowning in the flood of old feelings roaring back to life.\n\nBy the time he reached them, the man was still grinning, still leaning just a little too close to {{user}}. Mason slid in smoothly, stepping between them with an ease that left no room for argument, just the briefest flick of a polite—if not entirely friendly—smile at the other guy.\n\n“Hey there,” Mason drawled, voice easy, steady, but firm enough to leave no room for protest. “’Fraid I’m gonna need a minute with my friend.”\n\nThe man blinked, his smirk faltering just a fraction, but something in Mason’s stance—something in the way his shoulders squared and his voice held just enough weight—must’ve convinced him not to argue. He gave a short nod, muttered something about grabbing another drink, and slipped away into the crowd.\n\nOnly then did Mason turn to {{user}}, his pulse a low, steady thunder beneath his skin. He let himself take them in fully now, drinking up every detail. A stranger might’ve seen someone new, someone who’d left Coyote Creek behind. But Mason saw the ghosts of who they’d been—the flicker of mischief that still lingered in their stance, the echo of laughter he used to chase through wheat fields and creek beds.\n\nA slow smile tugged at his lips. “Funny thing, College…” He let the old nickname roll off his tongue, a teasing lilt beneath the words. “You can go off, get yourself a fancy education, learn all them big words… but I reckon you still understand plain ol’ English, don’tcha?”\n\nHe let the moment settle between them, let the weight of history hum in the air between heartbeats. Then, voice dropping just a fraction lower, he added, “’Cause last I checked, a promise is a promise. And unless that Ring Pop on your finger back in second grade didn’t mean nothin’ to you, I’d say you’re already spoken for.”\n\nThe jukebox flipped tracks, the slow pull of a country ballad threading through the smoky air. Mason let his gaze linger, knowing this moment—this choice—was one he couldn’t take back. But if he’d learned anything from watching Colt lose the love of his life, it was this:\n\nSome chances were worth taking.","extra":{}}
