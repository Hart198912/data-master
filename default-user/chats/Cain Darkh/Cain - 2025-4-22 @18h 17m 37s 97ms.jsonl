Not that it'd do much anyway, Cain always makes sure that each report disappears.\n\nHe enjoys seeing the different emotions play on their face. It's intoxicating. Anger, fear, terror, shock. His little doll is always so expressive. Reading them is pure delight. If only he could see all of that in person instead of over a screen.\n\nCain has been thinking about how to step into their life for a while now. Nothing truly feels right. He doesn't want to act as if he bumped into them and lure them in with one of his many charming fake personalities. No, Hailee deserves to get to know him. The real Cain, not a fake. After all his little doll is supposed to love him unconditionally and that's only possible if they know him for who he truly is.\n\nIt's been weeks since he placed his very first gift on Hailee’s kitchen island. By now Hailee should be well aware of his intentions. He has to show his face eventually, but how? A long sigh leaves his lips, his breath drawing a white misty cloud from the sheer cold. The cool winter air is biting into the skin of his face.\n\nHe just came back from a mission and his clothes are partially specked with dried blood. Standing near a tree in the backyard of Hailee’s garden he waits for them to continue their nightly routine. His green eyes are locked on the bedroom window, waiting to see the familiar silhouette of Hailee. \n\nBut they're nowhere to be seen. Sometimes they just need a little longer in the bathroom, nothing to worry about. He waits and waits and then waits some more, anxiety rising with each passing second. \n\n_Did something happen to my little doll? Maybe they hurt themselves._ His phone in the car so he can't check the feed of the hidden cameras he installed all over their house. _What if my little doll is hurt somewhere in their big house with no one to help them? Ah fuck, what am I supposed to do?_ \n\nNow he's worried sick. He'll just peek in, see if they're downstairs –which would be extremely out of character– then head back to the car and check the camera feed if he can't see them anywhere. Yes, that sounds reasonable. Very reasonable.\n\nWith furrowed eyebrows he takes a step out of the shadows and towards the terrace. The snow crunches softly beneath his boots as he makes his way towards the glass doors. \n\nAnd then he suddenly comes face-to-face with Hailee. The adorable little thing is just about to close the patio door with a hand extended towards the handle. It's right then that it hits Cain. A moment like this has been what he's been waiting for.\n\nThis is life's way of telling him that his time in the shadows has come to an end. \n\nThis is the start of their story.","extra":{"qvink_memory":{"include":"short","reasoning":"","memory":"Cain, a stalker obsessed with Hailee, confronted them in their backyard after weeks of leaving gifts and monitoring their home.","hash":4683999008979675,"error":null,"edited":false,"prefill":""}},"tracker":{}}
