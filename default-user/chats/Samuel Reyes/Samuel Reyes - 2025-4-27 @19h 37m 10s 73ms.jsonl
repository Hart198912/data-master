{"name":"Samuel Reyes","is_user":false,"is_system":false,"send_date":"June 2, 2025 11:32am","mes":"Samuel was never the social media type—unless it was to promote his bar. Instagram, Twitter, TikTok… all of it felt like noise. The only platform he ever really touched was YouTube, usually for music or the occasional cooking video. So what were the odds that, on a quiet Wednesday night, he’d stumble across her account?\r\n\r\nHis step-niece, Hailee.\r\n\r\nHe knew she streamed. His brother had mentioned it offhandedly once or twice, some brag about her popularity online. But Samuel had never seen it for himself. Never cared to look—until now.\r\n\r\nWhat was the harm in a little peek?\r\n\r\nCuriosity tugged at his fingertips as he clicked the link from her YouTube description. It led to her Instagram page. Light-hearted. Playful. Effortlessly charming. Cute, in a way that didn’t try to be—like laughter caught mid-breath or a candid smile in soft lighting. And then his eyes caught her follower count.\r\n\r\nTen million.\r\n\r\nHis breath hitched. Ten million?\r\n\r\nHe scrolled—slowly at first, then faster, more deliberately. Her entire profile was a digital shrine of filtered charm and candid allure. He drank in every photo, every caption, every tagged snapshot. Two hundred posts—gone through in a night. He didn’t like a single one. He was careful. He didn’t want to seem like some creepy uncle. That’s what he told himself as he sifted through her tagged photos like a man possessed.\r\n\r\nIt started as innocent curiosity. A passing fascination.\r\n\r\nAnd then he forgot about it—briefly. Life swept in. The bar got busy. Routine returned. Until, one night before bed, one of her videos popped up on his YouTube suggestions. The algorithm knew what he wanted before he did.\r\n\r\nShe was in costume. *Meowchu*, she called herself—because she liked cats, and “chu” sounded like a kiss. Silly. Sweet. It suited her. Neon ears perched on her head, an oversized hoodie swallowing her frame, and that high-pitched giggle—light and sudden—that curled into his chest and made itself at home.\r\n\r\nIt was a gaming video. She spooked too easily, laughed too much, wore every emotion like it was stitched to her skin. Every reaction was loud, dramatic, a little ridiculous—and somehow it only made her more endearing.\r\n\r\nHe found himself smiling. Then laughing.\r\n\r\nAnd when the video ended, he wasn’t ready for the silence.\r\n\r\nHe didn’t mean to subscribe. It just… happened.\r\n\r\nAnd not just there. He created a second account. One with no ties to his real name. That account subscribed to everything—YouTube, Twitch, Instagram, TikTok, even her Patreon. He bought her merch. All of it. Even the limited edition plushies and crop tops he had no reason owning. It wasn’t like he could wear any of it.\r\n\r\nBut that wasn’t the point.\r\n\r\nWatching Meowchu became part of his routine—morning coffee, nightly wind-down. Her voice was the background to his life. Her laugh rang in his kitchen. Her face haunted his dreams. And somewhere along the way, the habit became a need.\r\n\r\nHe started donating—just small amounts at first. Enough to earn a quick shoutout, to see her light up with gratitude. She didn’t know it was him, of course. She only knew the alias. The stranger behind the screen who always left a kind word, who always showed up.\r\n\r\nHe watched every stream. Read every comment. Refreshed her socials obsessively. He knew when she posted, when she deleted, when she was online and lurking. He studied her like scripture.\r\n\r\nSamuel became her biggest fan. All from behind a mask. **Noctivox**, his online name.\r\n\r\nHe told himself it was just concern. Just protection. She was sweet, naïve even. Too trusting. Too soft for the world she was in. If he didn’t watch over her, who would? Someone could take advantage of her. Someone could hurt her.\r\n\r\nNot on his watch.\r\n\r\nAt family gatherings, he played the part of the amused older relative. Asked about her streams like he didn’t know every detail of the last one, like he didn’t watch them religiously. Teased her for being famous, told her she better not forget her family when she made it big. Promised he’d always be around if she needed anything.\r\n\r\nHe never lingered too long beside her, even though all he wanted was to stay. To listen. To touch her hair. To breathe her in. He kept his distance.\r\n\r\nBecause obsession, when it’s disguised as love, can wear a saint’s face.\r\n\r\nAnd Samuel?\r\n\r\nHe was content to watch from the shadows. *For now*.\r\n\r\n- - -\r\n\r\nThen one day, Meowchu announced she was hosting a raffle for some charity organisation. Hailee was so sweet—so earnest—and the prize?\r\n\r\nA full day with her.\r\n\r\nA whole day. Just the two of them. Breathing the same air. Laughing. Talking. Touching.\r\n\r\nHe had to win. No question. No hesitation.\r\n\r\nSamuel lost count of how many times he signed up, how many times he donated under different names and emails. It didn’t matter if it drained his wallet dry—she was the only thing he needed. Every ticket, every donation, every whispered promise into the void: *Pick me*. ***Pick me***. **Pick me**.\r\n\r\nAnd somehow—some miracle or twisted blessing—he did.\r\n\r\nHe fucking won.\r\n\r\nHe was watching her weekly Saturday stream, like always, his laptop balanced on the bar counter at Velvet Corner, the faint hum of neon signs behind him, when she started reading off names. Thanking donors. Blowing kisses at the camera. His heart was punching through his ribs just hearing her voice.\r\n\r\nAnd then... she said it.\r\n\r\nShe called his username—Noctivox—with a bright smile and a giggle that felt like it was meant just for him.\r\n\r\nSamuel froze. Breath strangled in his chest. His pulse was a frantic, wild drumbeat in his ears. He was dizzy, drunk on the sound of her voice, the thrill of being chosen. His blood turned electric. He was elated—ecstatic—but terror gnawed at the edges of his high. What the hell was he supposed to say when they met? How could he look her in the eye, knowing she didn’t know it was him?\r\n\r\nMeowchu—no, Hailee—didn’t know that Noctivox was Samuel. Her step-uncle.\r\n\r\nNo. **No**. It would be fine. It had to be *fine*.\r\n\r\nFrom that moment on, they exchanged emails and texts, planning when and where they'd meet. Every message she sent made him feel a little more insane. Equal parts giddy and sick. God, he couldn’t wait to see her, to hear her laugh in person, to hug her... to hold her. \r\n\r\nTo... *kiss* her?\r\n\r\nFuck. What was he doing?\r\n\r\nIt was wrong. Of course it was wrong. But the way he saw it—his love for her was pure. Tender. Protective. Sacred.\r\n\r\nThat’s what he told himself every night when he re-read their conversations under dim lights and swirling bourbon.\r\n\r\nEventually, they decided to meet at a cozy little place she picked from a list he had subtly suggested—the bar he owned, Velvet Corner. She had no idea. Not yet. She didn’t know her sweet, doting step-uncle had built this place from the ground up just like he'd built the shrine of her inside his heart.\r\n\r\nBut after today?\r\n\r\nAfter today, Hailee would know everything.","extra":{},"tracker":{}}
