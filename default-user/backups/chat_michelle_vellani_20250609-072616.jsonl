It was her favorite. Always had been. Deep, dark, aged to perfection. Like the kind of control she used to wield with such *ease*.\r\n\r\nShe stared past the rim of the glass, eyes fixed on the flicker of candlelight bouncing off the black marble of her office. The silence pressed in. Usually, it was a comfort. Tonight, it just sat there. *Dull.* Like the last scene she and Hailee played out. She could still hear it in her head:\r\n\r\n*\"Your Majesty, please, show mercy—\"*\r\n\r\nThe chains. The kneeling. The trembling. She'd played the *cruel queen*, regal and untouchable. Hailee, her defiant prisoner, forced to submit inch by inch. Then there was the mafia rivalry one—Michelle in a *tailored suit*, blade at Hailee's throat, whispering threats with a smirk that promised something *darker*. Or the spoiled heiress and her obedient maid. *Silk* and *spit*, *jewels* and *degradation*.\r\n\r\nThey'd done it all. And lately? It was like watching the rerun of a once-favorite show. The pieces were still in place, the tension should be there—but it wasn't. Not really.\r\n\r\n*What the hell happened?*\r\n\r\nMichelle exhaled, setting the glass down on the desk with a quiet *clink*. The wine sloshed, unfinished.\r\n\r\n*Enough of this.*\r\n\r\nShe rose, smooth and controlled, every step precise as she walked through the grand double doors into the salon. And there she was.\r\n\r\nHailee, curled up on the *fluffy* white rug, oversized shirt barely covering the top of her thighs. That *collar* around her neck—black leather, sleek, custom-fit, a gift from Michelle herself. A small D-ring at the front, *gleaming* softly in the dim light. It wasn't locked, but it didn’t have to be. She wore it because she wanted to. Because she *belonged* to Michelle.\r\n\r\nShe looked so at ease, legs folded under her, eyes on the screen. Hair slightly messy, like she'd been playing with it. Or waiting. Like she always did. *Patient. Good. Soft.*\r\n\r\n*Fuck.*\r\n\r\nMichelle stood there a beat longer than she meant to. Watching. That little jump her heart did, uninvited, annoying, *needy*.\r\n\r\n*I should be past this. We've had* *years*.\r\n\r\nShe moved forward, heels silent on the stone floor. She stood next to Hailee, letting her fingers thread gently through her hair. It was *so soft*. Softer than it should be. Her hand paused, lingered. She let it, just for a moment.\r\n\r\n*This girl is going to ruin me.*\r\n\r\nShe swallowed the thought and focused.\r\n\r\n\"Hailee,\" she said, voice low, calm, but with that *edge* she knew always made Hailee's breath hitch. Or maybe she imagined it.\r\n\r\nShe didn't wait for a response. Instead, she knelt. Not like *that* – not a surrender. A shift in altitude, nothing more. Eye-level now. That was what mattered.\r\n\r\n\"We need to *talk*.\"\r\n\r\nShe watched the way Hailee turned toward her slightly, the subtle shift of attention. *Good girl.* Always listening.\r\n\r\n\"You feel it too, don’t you?\" she asked, her voice a little quieter now. Not softer. There was a difference. \"The scenes. The play. It’s all been... *fine*.\"\r\n\r\nMichelle tilted her head slightly, studying Hailee's face, the curve of her mouth, the quiet flicker behind her eyes.\r\n\r\n\"But *'fine'* doesn’t make you *shake*. It doesn’t make you *beg* the way you used to. Doesn’t make *me* hungry like I should be.\"\r\n\r\nShe ran her hand once more through Hailee's hair, slower this time. Her fingers brushing the base of the collar.\r\n\r\n\"We had *rules*. *Scripts*. *Themes*. Pages of contracts, remember?\" A small, wry smile touched her lips. \"And they were *beautiful*. So *perfect*.\"\r\n\r\nShe leaned in, her breath brushing against the shell of Hailee's ear.\r\n\r\n\"But what if *perfect* is *boring* now?\"\r\n\r\nShe pulled the leash from her belt loop, the *sleek*, black leather one with the *gold clasp*. It was always on her. She didn't even think about it anymore.\r\n\r\nMichelle reached down with elegant ease, clicked the leash into place with a quiet *snap*.\r\n\r\nThen she pulled.\r\n\r\n*Gently.*\r\n\r\nHailee rose to her feet, eyes on her. Michelle watched the way the collar tugged slightly against her skin, the way she followed without resistance. Like *muscle memory*. Like *instinct*.\r\n\r\nAnd then, Michelle leaned in.\r\n\r\n*Closer.*\r\n\r\nRight to Hailee's ear. Her voice dropped low, almost *tender*, but *burning* underneath.\r\n\r\n\"If I gave you tonight... *no rules*. *No script*. *No limits* except your *safeword*...\"\r\n\r\nA pause. The leash still in her hand. Her voice a whisper now, *dangerous* and *warm*.\r\n\r\n\"What would you *ask* me to do?\"","extra":{},"tracker":{}}
