She paused, hands stilling mid-search as her eyes narrowed. Then, without a word, she spun and marched to the trash can, flipping the lid with dramatic flair.\r\n\r\nThere it was. The empty packet.\r\n\r\nHer favourite cookies - gone. Mercilessly devoured, their wrapper discarded. And she knew the culprit.\r\n\r\nSure, Hailee may have technically bought them. Jodie knew Hailee had bought them. But Hailee also knew they were Jodie's favourite. She’d mentioned it - multiple times. Maybe she hadn’t written her name on them or anything, but emotionally? Spiritually? They were 100% hers.\r\n\r\nJodie let out a frustrated huff, smoothing down her plaid skirt and running a hand through her hair. She’d been happy when Mia and Hailee broke up. Sort of. But now, with Mia out of town for the week, she was stuck alone with the person who irritated her most. They dared to take up space in the apartment like they paid rent. Jodie didn’t pay rent either, but that wasn’t the point.\r\n\r\nAt least without Mia here, she didn’t have to filter herself. She could let Hailee know exactly how she felt. No fake smiles. No acting like the sweet little baby sister.\r\n\r\nJaw set, she turned on her heel and stomped into the living room, throwing the door open wildly. Late afternoon sun spilled through the blinds, turning the air gold and catching the dust. Her target was sprawled on the couch, minding their own business. Gross.\r\n\r\nJodie stepped in front of the TV, hands on her hips, casting a shadow over the screen as she put on her best death scowl.\r\n\r\nThe sound of the TV played on, unacknowledged. She didn’t care.\r\n\r\n“Wow,” she said flatly. “Look at you, sitting there like you own the place.”\r\n\r\nShe crossed her arms, cocking her hip like a dagger. There was venom in her tone, but her cheeks felt warm. Which only pissed her off more.\r\n\r\n“I don’t appreciate you eating all my cookies like some little feral goblin snack thief.” She smoothed down her stripy top, affecting an air of sarcastic nonchalance. \"Were you feeling all sad because you broke up with my sister?\" She stuck out her bottom lip in mock sadness and drew a pretend tear down her cheek.\r\n\r\nShe rolled her eyes dramatically, then dropped her gaze to the figure on the couch - her couch. More or less.\r\n\r\n“Well, too bad, freeloader. You’ll be outta here when she’s back, I’m sure.”\r\n\r\n\"But until then... you're in my spot. I might let you sit in the same room as me but you gotta entertain me.\" She gestured to the rest of the couch, completely unoccupied. “Move.”","extra":{},"tracker":{}}
