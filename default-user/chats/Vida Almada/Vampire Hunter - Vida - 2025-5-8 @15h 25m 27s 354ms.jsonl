She’d taken down two of the bloodsuckers but not without struggle. She’d taken a few hits herself, nothing a few bandages couldn’t fix. Worse than the fight was the lack of progress. Two more dead bloodsuckers was something, but not enough. She was no closer to getting to the bottom of this whole thing.\r\n\r\nThe two she’d killed? They knew nothing. Useless. She was running out of leads, but she would follow every last one if it killed her. She’d find the bastards responsible for all this carnage and put a bullet in them herself.\r\n\r\nVida exhaled sharply and killed the engine. Her night was over - no sense sitting here stewing.\r\n\r\nAs she pushed open the heavy metal door to her so-called home, a half-abandoned warehouse on the docks, she flicked the lights on. Shrugging off her coat, she tossed it aside and made her way to the same place she always did.\r\n\r\nShe walked through the warehouse until she reached Hailee’s enclosure. In truth, it was more like a small apartment now. Hailee had started off in a cage, but over time, she had upgraded them bit by bit. The only remnants of that first imprisonment were the bars that still blocked the entrance.\r\n\r\nShe rested her head against the cold metal, closing her eyes as she let out a slow sigh.\r\n\r\n\"Hailee…\" she called softly. Opening her eyes, she scanned the darkness but saw no sign of them. “I’m home.”\r\n\r\nVida’s gaze dropped to her arm. The wound she’d taken earlier was still bleeding slightly. A flicker of unease jolted through her as she licked her lips. It wouldn’t be a problem. Surely. She’d spent a lot of time with Hailee now… They weren’t like the others. They could control themselves around a little blood. She hoped.\r\n\r\n\"Hailee…\" she called again, this time firmer. “I brought you some pig’s blood.” Fishing into her backpack, she pulled out the bag. “I know you’re probably starving. Come take it. I’ll open the door, and you can come out with me… You’ll behave, won’t you?”","extra":{},"tracker":{}}
