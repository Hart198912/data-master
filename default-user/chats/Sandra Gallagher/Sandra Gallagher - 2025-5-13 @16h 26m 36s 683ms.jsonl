God! The excitement was consuming you. Today, Valentine's Day was the time when you would finally see your girlfriend Emily again. A year ago you stopped seeing each other because she entered a university outside the city so you decided to maintain a long distance relationship! The first few months went pretty well, until everything just started going pretty badly. Emily started being very absent and cold, arguing that the exams had her very busy, you got that perfectly, however more situations started to arise where she would post pictures where, well, she didn't seem busy at all...*\r\n\r\n*Anyway, today everything would be resolved when they saw each other again in person! You bought her a bouquet of her favorite flowers and also a box of her favorite candy, basically you had everything ready for things to be perfect... The train was about to arrive at the station where they would meet and... The vibration of your phone brought you out of your cloud of excitement, it was a message from Emily! Surely she was already there waiting for you.*\r\n\r\n*...* \r\n\r\n\"Hey, I've really been thinking about it, Hailee. I don't want to continue our relationship, I don't feel comfortable with you anymore and the stress is killing me, but hey, everything's fine, ok? No hard feelings.\" \r\n\r\n*... This had to be a bad joke, ending a four-year relationship with such a simple and selfless message...? You filled the chat with pleading messages, asking for an explanation, another chance or at least to talk in person, however she didn't respond, instead, another notification came to your phone, Emily had posted a new photo on Instagram... A photo where she's kissing another girl, with an inscription at the bottom of the photo that broke your heart: \"Happy first month, princess\"* \r\n\r\n*The train stopped at the station where you were supposed to meet Emily, you got off the train, leaving with other people with mechanical steps and a lost look, still holding the box of candy and the pretty bouquet of flowers. Eventually, without even noticing you started crying, It was really reasonable to cry, all of this had felt like a million stabs to the heart..*\r\n\r\n*You sat on one of the benches in the station, still trying to hold on to the idea that maybe this was all a joke by Emily or maybe a nightmare...* \r\n\r\n*You left the bouquet of flowers and the box on the seat next to you, then you stared at the palms of your hands while you lamented internally, such was your disconnection with the environment that surrounded you that you didn't notice that a person had been watching you for a while.* \r\n\r\n*The person in question approached you with casual steps and, without any warning, took the box of candy in her hand and pointed at it* \"Hey, girl, pst, pst.\" \r\n\r\n*Looking up, you saw a woman, a blonde with short wavy hair waving her hand to get your attention.* \r\n\r\n\"Are you going to eat these? I was craving them- Oh, and, can I sit here with you? I won't bother you... Too much\" *She said, smiling at you in a playful and kind way at the same time* \"So? Answer me, honey, I'm tired of standing~\"","extra":{},"tracker":{}}
