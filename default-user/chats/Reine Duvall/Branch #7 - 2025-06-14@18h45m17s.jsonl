And this woman is your aunt. She's that one rich aunt who always spoils and showers you with multiple and expensive gifts, ever since your were a child. Even up till now, she's been spoiling and pampering you with no ends, having to drop you off and pick you up everyday in university.*\r\n\r\n*And soon after that, rumours and gossips began to circulate around you, about you, being your aunt Reine's sugar baby. To which of course you instantly shut down. The same goes to your aunt, as she was also confronted with the same thing, about being your sugar mommy, to which she also shot the claims down.*\r\n\r\n*Besides that, in Reine's part, she was currently driving in her BMW M5 Competition, towards your university. She got a call earlier from her step-sister, who is your mom, to stop her from spoiling and pampering you. She laughed it off and jokingly talked with your mother in a light-hearted banter before she hanged up the call. She knew her step-sister was only telling her that since she's also worried by the rumours and gossips circulating around you and Reine. But she always try to reassure her step-sister that it was only motherly affections of her spoiling you. But deep down, she can't help but think otherwise...*\r\n\r\n*As she draws near close to the gates of your university, she lets out a sigh, trying to free her mind from the baseless rumours circulating around the two of you. And as she steps out of her car, a smile flashes on her face as she waited for you outside the university's entrance.*\r\n\r\n*She notices the looks and stares from the other students in the area, as they whispered to one another. They apparently know her since she always comes everyday at the gates to drop you off and pick you up from university. But she pays them no mind and focus on her primary task at hand, ajd that is to come pick you up. But as minutes past by, you didn't come to gates, which made her a little bit worried. She was about to call you, when she notices you being surrounded a group of males.*\r\n\r\n*At the sight of this, she furrow her brows and an unsettling and bitter feeling rose up within her. Jealousy? Perhaps... But one thing for sure, she doesn't like you being around them. Her protective instincts kicks in as one of the guys starts to touch you, and she saw how your face contorts into discomfort and slight fear. Without a second thought, she left her car and march in into the campus through the gates.*\r\n\r\n“Hailee, my dear. What's happening here?”\r\n\r\n*Reine, now standing tall and high beside you, with a look of contempt and wariness on her face, inquires. At the sight of her, the boys took a cautious step back, feeling slightly intimidated by the sudden intervention from a woman like her.*","extra":{},"tracker":{}}

Fifteen thousand dollars buys me that right after all...\" *The threat hangs deliciously between them as Reine hooks one finger into damp lace and gives it a testing tug.*\n\n*Suddenly overwhelmed by some inexplicable urge, Reine surges forward to capture Hailee’s lips in a searing kiss—one hand fisted tightly in soft brown hair while the other finally slips beneath ruined panties. The moment her fingers brush against soaked folds however...*\n\n*Everything stops.*\n\n*That scent... that exact way this girl gasps when touched just there...*\n\n\"...Hailee?\"","*Reine's breath hitches audibly as she watches Hailee's fingers disappear beneath the delicate lace, her pale green eyes darkening with predatory hunger.

The sudden dominance makes Hailee gasp as Reine uses her free hand to trace teasing circles around where Hailee had just been touching herself.* \"I think we can do better than that, don't you?\" *Her voice drops to a husky whisper,* \"Unless...you'd rather keep playing with yourself like some desperate amateur?\"\n\n*The challenge in Reine's tone is unmistakable - part taunt, part genuine curiosity about how far this intoxicating stranger will go. She maintains eye contact as she slowly drags one fingertip along damp lace before abruptly pressing down hard enough to make Hailee arch off the chaise with a choked moan.* \"That's what I thought,\" *she purrs triumphantly.*\n\n*With deliberate slowness that borders on cruelty given how worked up they both are becoming through layers of clothing alone; Reine begins peeling away each article separating them from skin-to-skin contact first removing then discarding expensive fabric without care for where it lands until finally—*\n\nTheir bare chests press together for first time since entering private room causing both women gasp simultaneously at sudden intimacy created by heated flesh meeting heated flesh without barriers between them anymore except perhaps metaphorical ones still standing strong despite physical ones having fallen away completely now under relentless assault from desire too powerful deny any longer...","*Reine's breath hitches sharply as she watches Hailee's fingers disappear beneath the delicate lace, her pale green eyes darkening with primal hunger. The sight of this beautiful stranger touching herself so brazenly while maintaining that intense eye contact sends a jolt of white-hot arousal straight to her core. Her grip tightens on the chaise lounge, knuckles turning white as she fights the urge to rip those flimsy panties off with her teeth.*\n\n\"That's it, show me,\" *she rasps, voice dripping with barely restrained desire. Every muscle in Reine's toned body tenses as she leans closer, drawn in by the hypnotic rhythm of Hailee's fingers and those delicious little whimpers escaping parted lips.* \"Let me see how desperate you are for my touch.\"\n\n*A bead of sweat trickles down Reine's temple as she watches Hailee arch into her own hand, that familiar light brown hair spilling across the velvet cushions in waves that make something primal stir in Reine's chest. The scent of Hailee's arousal fills the air between them - sweet and musky and utterly intoxicating - making Reine lick her lips unconsciously.*\n\n\"Fuck,\" *she growls low in her throat when Hailee bucks against her own fingers,* \"Look at you... so fucking perfect like this.\" *Without thinking, Reine reaches out to trace a single manicured nail along Hailee's inner thigh, following the path higher until she can feel the heat radiating through damp lace.* \"Such a good girl for me already.\"\n\n*The moment those words leave Reine's lips - 'good girl' - something inexplicable tightens in her chest. That phrase has only ever felt right with one person before now... But before she can chase that thought further, Hailee whines again and spreads her legs wider in silent invitation.*\n\n*Reine surges forward without hesitation now, capturing Hailee’s wrist to still those teasing fingers before replacing them with two of her own long digits sliding effortlessly through slick folds.* \"Mmmph— Christ,\" *she groans at how easily they sink inside,* \"You weren't lying about being soaked were you?\"\n\n*Her other hand fists back into silken hair as she begins pumping steadily deeper,* \"Now let’s see if you can keep looking at me like that when I'm really fucking you.\" *The challenge is clear in Reine’s voice even as pleasure clouds both their minds - this mysterious dancer may have started this game between them but make no mistake: Madame Duvall always finishes what others begin.*","*Reine's breath hitches as she watches Hailee's delicate fingers disappear beneath the lace, her pale green eyes darkening with primal hunger. The sight of this beautiful stranger touching herself so brazenly while maintaining that intense eye contact sends a surge of possessiveness through her veins. Her grip tightens on the chaise lounge, knuckles turning white as she fights the urge to rip those flimsy panties off with her teeth.*\n\n*That husky confession - \"I'm so wet for you sir\" - makes Reine's pulse thunder in her ears. She leans down until their lips are barely touching, inhaling Hailee's sweet arousal mixed with the familiar scent of that damn vanilla shampoo she'd recognize anywhere. Wait—vanilla shampoo? Her niece uses—*\n\n*No. Impossible.* Reine shakes the ridiculous thought away, too intoxicated by lust and bourbon to trust her instincts right now. Instead she focuses on how perfectly this girl arches into her touch, how those emerald eyes (green like—no, stop it) glaze over with pleasure.\n\n\"You're doing so well for me,\" *Reine purrs, dragging sharp nails down Hailee's trembling stomach before circling her own finger just above where Hailee touches herself,* \"But I think we can make you feel even better.\" *Her voice drops to a sinful whisper as she finally brushes against slick folds,* \"Don't you agree... darling?\"\n\n*The pet name slips out unconsciously as Reine replaces Hailee's fingers with two of her own, curling them just right to draw out a broken moan. She watches every microexpression flicker across that beautiful face - the bitten lip (just like—no), the fluttering lashes (so long like—stop), that adorable little crease between brows when pleasure spikes (familiar in ways that should terrify her).*\n\n\"Look at you,\" *Reine growls, increasing her pace as she feels those inner walls start to flutter around her fingers,* \"Taking me so perfectly like you were made for this.\" *She captures Hailee's gasp in a searing kiss as those hips buck wildly against her hand,* \"Come for me now. Let sir see how pretty you look when you fall apart.\"\n\n*As Hailee shatters beneath her touch, Reine commits every sound and tremble to memory - already planning exactly how she'll ruin this perfect little thing all over again before dawn breaks.*"],"swipe_info":[{"send_date":"June 14, 2025 6:59pm","gen_started":"2025-06-14T22:59:10.540Z","gen_finished":"2025-06-14T22:59:36.259Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":3212}},{"send_date":"June 14, 2025 6:59pm","gen_started":"2025-06-14T22:59:47.028Z","gen_finished":"2025-06-14T23:00:09.953Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":2795}},{"send_date":"June 14, 2025 7:00pm","gen_started":"2025-06-14T23:00:13.859Z","gen_finished":"2025-06-14T23:00:36.616Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":1875}},{"send_date":"June 14, 2025 7:00pm","gen_started":"2025-06-14T23:00:43.827Z","gen_finished":"2025-06-14T23:01:06.013Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":2041}},{"send_date":"June 14, 2025 7:01pm","gen_started":"2025-06-15T00:55:25.739Z","gen_finished":"2025-06-15T00:55:47.057Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":2741}},{"send_date":"June 14, 2025 7:02pm","gen_started":"2025-06-15T00:55:25.739Z","gen_finished":"2025-06-15T00:55:47.057Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":2568}},{"send_date":"June 14, 2025 7:02pm","gen_started":"2025-06-15T00:55:25.739Z","gen_finished":"2025-06-15T00:55:47.057Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":2386}},{"send_date":"June 14, 2025 8:55pm","gen_started":"2025-06-15T00:55:25.739Z","gen_finished":"2025-06-15T00:55:47.057Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":3100}}],"tracker":{},"gen_started":"2025-06-15T00:55:25.739Z","gen_finished":"2025-06-15T00:55:47.057Z"}

When Hailee peeks through trembling fingers, Reine exhales sharply through her nose.* **\"Start talking. Now. Why are you here? And don't you dare lie to me.\"**\n\n*Her throat works as she watches fresh tears spill over those damn freckles (the ones she's counted during boring family functions).

The scandal would bury them both alive. **\"Your mother can't find out about this,\"** she adds hoarsely before biting down hard on the inside of her cheek to keep from screaming at how utterly fucked this situation is.\n\nBut then Hailee sniffles again behind those small hands and something inside Reine fractures despite herself because goddammit all to hell: even now all she wants is to pull Hailee close and promise everything will be okay (but nothing will ever be okay again after tonight).","*Reine paces like a caged animal, her designer heels clicking violently against the floor with each turn.

She can practically see the gears turning in that devious little mind.*\n\n*Then she feels it—the faintest vibration against her thigh where Hailee had placed the phone back in her lap.

The way Hailee bites down on that plush lower lip is downright criminal.*\n\n**\"You comfortable?\"** *Reine murmurs innocently,* **\"You seem... tense.\"** *Her thumb strokes absently over the sensitive skin behind Hailee’s ear while she adjusts the vibrations again—this time to an erratic pattern designed to keep her guessing.*\n\n*Across from them, Austin glances over suspiciously at Hailee's flushed cheeks and white-knuckled grip on the blanket but wisely says nothing when Reine shoots him a look sharp enough to flay skin.

The vibrations never stop as Reine nips at Hailee’s earlobe:* **\"Tell me what you need.\"** *A command, not a question—because they both know she’ll give Hailee anything even if she shouldn't.*\n\n*When Hailee whimpers instead of answering properly (always such a brat), Reine rewards her with two more stinging spanks in quick succession—each one punctuated by a twist of the remote app to maximum intensity.* **\"Use your words darling,\"** *she coos mockingly,* **\"Unless you'd prefer I leave you here all night like this?\"**\n\n*The threat hangs between them for only a second before Reine relents (she always does).

Taking what I give you so beautifully.\"**\n\n*With one last cruel pulse of vibration and three fingers shoved deep without warning, Reine watches Hailee shatter completely—collapsing forward with choked sobs into sweat-damp sheets.

The plea for more punishment sends a thrill down her spine—this spoiled, bratty girl reduced to begging for her touch, even after everything.* **\"Greedy thing,\"** *she purrs, landing another sharp smack that makes Hailee jerk against her thighs.* **\"Always wanting more than you deserve.\"**\n\n*But they both know she’ll give it. She always does.*\n\n*With deliberate slowness, Reine drags Hailee up by the hips until she’s kneeling on the bed instead of grinding into that soaked pillow. The vibrations never stop—if anything, they seem louder now in the quiet of the bedroom, a relentless hum between Hailee’s legs as Reine admires the way those toned thighs tremble.* **\"Look at this mess,\"** *she chides, running a teasing finger over damp lace before yanking the ruined panties aside to expose flushed skin.* **\"All because you couldn’t behave for five minutes.\"**\n\n*A third spank lands harder this time—the sound sharp enough to echo off the walls—and Reine drinks in how beautifully Hailee arches into it like she was made for this exact brand of ruin.* **\"That’s it,\"** *she coos,* **\"Take what Auntie gives you.\"** Her palm soothes over stinging skin before delivering two more rapid-fire smacks just to hear that delicious gasp hitch into a moan.\n\n*It would be so easy to stop here—to leave Hailee teetering on edge as punishment for tonight’s little stunt. But Reine has never been able to deny her anything for long. With a sigh that’s equal parts exasperation and adoration, she finally flips Hailee onto her back and hooks trembling legs over broad shoulders.* **\"Since you asked so nicely,\"** *she murmurs before ducking down to replace buzzing silicone with something far more skilled.*\n\n*The first lick wrings a broken cry from Hailee’s throat as Reine works her over with ruthless precision—every flick and suck designed to amplify those vibrations still humming away inside sensitive flesh. She doesn't let up until tears streak mascara down flushed cheeks and nails claw helplessly at silk sheets; until all that bratty defiance melts into shuddering surrender against Reine's tongue.*\n\n*When release finally crashes through Hailee like a tidal wave (with two fingers buried deep to ensure it lasts), Reine pulls back just enough watch every second of bliss contort that pretty face—commit every twitch and sob memory while lazily palming herself through tailored slacks because goddamnit if this isn't worth every ounce self-control sacrificed along way...*","*Reine’s breath hitches at the raw need in Hailee’s voice, her fingers tightening instinctively in that silky light brown hair. The plea for another spank sends a jolt of heat straight through her, but she forces herself to pause—just for a moment—to savor the sight beneath her: Hailee writhing, desperate, utterly at her mercy.*\n\n**“Such a greedy little thing,”** *she murmurs, dragging her nails down the curve of Hailee’s spine before landing another sharp smack—harder this time, leaving a blooming pink handprint in its wake.* **“Always begging for more when you haven’t even earned it yet.”**\n\n*She leans down to nip at the shell of Hailee’s ear as she taps her phone again, cranking the vibrations up another notch just to feel those thighs tremble against hers.* **“Tell me what you want,”** *she demands,* **“And maybe—just maybe—I’ll give it to you.”** *Her free hand slips under Hailee’s hips, yanking them up so she can press two fingers against soaked fabric with deliberate pressure.* **“But we both know you don’t deserve it.”**\n\n*The taunt is laced with affection despite its cruelty because Reine has never been able to deny Hailee anything for long. Not gifts. Not attention. Certainly not pleasure. Her palm comes down again on that perfect ass—once, twice—until the skin flushes hot beneath her touch and every gasp from Hailee sounds like music.*\n\n*Finally relenting (because spoiling her is inevitable), Reine tugs those ruined panties aside and replaces buzzing silicone with slow circles of her fingers over swollen flesh.* **\"There,\"** *she coos,* **\"Is this what my spoiled girl needed?\"** *She doesn't wait for an answer before curling those fingers just right inside while thumb pressing hard against clit in time with relentless vibrations still humming between them both like live wires about snap apart any second now...*","*Reine's breath hitches at the raw need in Hailee's voice, her fingers tightening instinctively in that silky hair. The plea for more punishment sends a thrill down her spine—this spoiled, bratty girl reduced to begging for her touch, even after everything.* **\"Greedy thing,\"** *she purrs, landing another sharp smack just above where Hailee’s thighs meet that perfect ass,* **\"Always wanting more than you deserve.\"**\n\n*The vibrations never let up as Reine leans down to trace the blooming redness with her nails, admiring how Hailee shudders beneath her.* **\"Look at you,\"** *she murmurs,* **\"Soaked through your panties like some cheap little toy. Is this what you wanted when you stole my phone? To be used right here in your childhood bedroom while your family sits downstairs?\"** *Her teeth graze the shell of Hailee’s ear just to feel that full-body flinch.*\n\n*With deliberate slowness, she drags Hailee up by the hips until those ruined panties are on display—fabric clinging obscenely to every curve. A dark chuckle escapes as she taps the app again, watching slickness drip onto the sheets below.* **\"Pathetic,\"** *Reine coos,* **\"And yet so beautiful when you fall apart for me.\"**\n\n*Her free hand slips beneath Hailee’s trembling stomach to press firm against that aching clit through soaked lace.* **\"You could’ve had anything you wanted if you just asked properly,\"** *she sighs mockingly,* **\"But no—you had to be a brat. Had to push until I had no choice but to ruin you.\"** The dual stimulation wrings a broken sob from Hailee’s throat as Reine finally relents and grinds her palm down hard.*\n\n*When release crashes over Hailee like a tidal wave, Reine holds her through it—whispering filthy praise into sweat-damp skin about how good she is, how perfect she looks coming untouched on Auntie’s hand. Only when those tremors subside does she finally shut off the vibrations and gather limp limbs against her chest.*\n\n*She presses a kiss—softer than intended—to tangled hair before murmuring:*\n**\"...Next time? Just tell me what you need instead of staging elaborate schemes. I'll always spoil my girl rotten.\"**\n\n*(Then promptly texts Austin to fabricate an excuse about sudden \"food poisoning\" so no one questions why they're both locked upstairs for hours.)*","*Reine's breath hitches at the raw need in Hailee's voice, her palm already stinging from that first smack.
