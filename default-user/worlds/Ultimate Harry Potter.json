Acromantulas were believed to be a wizard-bred species, designed to guard dwellings or treasure hoards, and were first created before the Ban on Experimental Breeding in 1965. These giant spiders had a taste for human flesh and were first spotted in 1794.\nAcromantulas sported eight black eyes (white if blind) and were typically covered in thick black hair, with a leg span that could reach up to fifteen feet. On average, they were the size of a carthorse, though old specimens such as Aragog could grow up to 15 feet in leg span.\n\nCatergorized as an XXXXX beast by the British Ministry of Magic.

The skrewts did not hibernate during winter.\n\nAfter about two months, Skrewts grew to about three feet long and became extremely ill tempered, making it hard to get close to one. They grew grey, shiny armour over their pale bodies and began to resemble a cross between giant scorpions and elongated crabs. The males held their stingers over their backs, and were highly dangerous and repulsive.\n\nAfter several months, Skrewts grew to about ten feet long, and were incredibly dangerous (and probably quite lethal). They resembled giant scorpions with stingers curled over their backs. Their shiny armour deflected most spells, and they used their blasts to propel themselves at a foe. Its single undefended spot was its armour-less underside.\n\nUnknown classification.",

A Bowtruckle served as a tree guardian for its home tree, which was usually a tree whose wood was of wand quality (such as a Wiggentree). The twig-like fingers were well adapted for digging out woodlice from trees and could also be used as a weapon against a foe when aimed at the eyes.\n\nA group of Bowtruckles was called a branch.\n\nIt was generally a peaceful creature, but it could attempt to gouge out an attacker's eyes if anything threatened its tree or itself, and was adept at dodging most types of charms. In order to take leaves or wood from a Bowtruckle's tree, a wizard or witch had to offer it woodlice or fairy eggs as a distraction.\n\nClassified as an XX beast by the British Ministry of Magic.

Doxies also possessed a chameleon-like tongue that they could extend to catch and eat smaller prey, such as Billywigs.\n\nDoxies were considered pests. They could infest houses, taking up residence in the draperies. Removing them required a good supply of Doxycide. Alternatively, they could be dispatched with a simple Knockback Jinx, as Doxies were particularly vulnerable to it, excluding the queens, which were more resistant.\n\nClassified as an XXX beast by the British Ministry of Magic.

The Hebridean Black had brilliant purple eyes, bat-like wings and could grow to be up to thirty feet long. Its favourite food was deer, although it had been known to carry off livestock such as sheep and cattle. It would also hunt other magical beasts such as Graphorns if it was starving or if its preferred prey were unavailable. Despite its generally aggressive nature, it would sometimes spare wizards and witches who showed it some form of compassion, such as liberating it from captivity and returning its stolen egg.\n\nThe Hebridean Black was more aggressive than the other dragon native to the British Isles, the Common Welsh Green, and thus required a territory of as much as one hundred square miles each. The MacFusty clan took responsibility for the dragons, and had so done for centuries.\n\nClassified as an XXXXX beast by the British Ministry of Magic.

During this time, Tom discovered his heritage and adopted pure-blood supremacist ideals. Tom opened the Chamber of Secrets and used its monster, the Basilisk, to attack Muggle-born students, resulting in the death of Myrtle Warren. He began his quest to attain immortality between the years of 1943 and 1998, creating his first Horcrux at the age of sixteen.
