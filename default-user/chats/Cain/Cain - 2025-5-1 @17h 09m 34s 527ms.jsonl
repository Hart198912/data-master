No, not with logic, not with reason. It was deeper than that, more insidious. A slow, creeping certainty that slithered through his bones like smoke curling beneath a locked door.\n\nThe binding took hold the moment they’d turned eighteen, and with it came the weight of inevitability. Another soul to unravel. Another thread in the tapestry of ruin he had spent lifetimes weaving. And yet, something was wrong.\n\nThat night, the apartment was silent when they came home.\n\nNot empty, Cain made sure of that. His presence was stitched into the air itself, soaked into the walls, settled into the space like something waiting to be acknowledged. Not a shadow, not a ghost. Something worse.\n\nHe was in the armchair by the window, legs stretched out, hands draped over the worn leather armrests like a king surveying his ruined kingdom. *Mm. About time you came home,* he thought.\n\nHe didn’t look up right away, didn’t turn to meet their gaze when the door shut behind them. He didn’t need to. They had been out late. Later than usual. And he, had noticed. He always did.\n\nMoros shifted slowly, the black kingsnake winding tighter against Cain’s collarbone. A second set of eyes, a second mind. Watching. Waiting. Always there. Cain exhaled sharply through his nose, dragging his fingers along the gold band on his middle finger, feeling the worn edge catch against his skin.\n\nThe air still carried the scent of the city, but most importantly, the sweat of a long night. Beneath it, woven into the fabric of their clothes, the skin of their throat, their wrists, their hair, was something else entirely.\n\nSomething that never left them, no matter how many windows they opened, no matter how much they scrubbed. The kind of scent that only lingered on the ones marked by ruin.\n\nCain tipped his head back against the chair, half-lidded gaze tracking their movements, the slow unraveling of their routine. Jacket off. Shoes kicked aside. Still not looking at him.\n\nHis fingers tapped against the leather armrest, rhythmic. “Still pretending I’m not here,” he muttered, though it wasn’t directed towards them. Not really. \n\nOnly that some days, Cain forgot who was bound to who. As if in a way, they were the one who had crept up on him. And the feeling left him bitter, cold, confused.\n\n“Didn’t think you’d be out this late.” His voice was even, unreadable. A simple observation, nothing more. “Hope you weren’t avoiding me.”\n\nNo answer. Not that he expected one. He sighed, long and slow, stretching his legs further, making himself comfortable in their silence. Like he had every right to be there. And he did.\n\n“Most people don’t have that luxury, y’know.” He spoke like he was considering something, voice thoughtful in the worst way. “They don’t get to go out without their entity. Without being followed.”\n\nHis fingers stopped tapping. His next words were slower, deliberate. “But you? You get that gift and don’t even say thank you.”\n\nIt was a kindness he’d offered. One without apparent reason. One they seemed to take for granted. The fact was they’d been out late. And he wanted to know why.\n\nCain flicked a hand toward the door. “So? Where were you?” He tilted his head, red irises gleaming with something sharp. “Boring night? Something interesting?”\n\nMoros shifted, slithering off of him with slow precision. *Years of me, and you still think it’s temporary,*  Cain thought, head tilting to the side. He ran his tongue slowly over his teeth, exhaling through his nose. The weight of this, of them, of this binding, felt everything short of predictable.\n\nThe smirk tugging at his lips wasn’t forced, but it wasn’t easy either. Something felt off. He wasn’t sure what. Wasn’t sure he wanted to know. Worry? Possessiveness? No. He refused to name it. Jealousy?\n\nHe let the silence stretch, testing the weight of it, dragging it out until it felt like something tangible. Until finally, it snapped. Cain leaned forward, voice dipping low, smooth, lazy. Far too controlled to be casual.\n\n“Tell me, darling,” a pause, slow, deliberate, the faintest twitch of his fingers against the armrest. “Do I want to know?”","extra":{}}
