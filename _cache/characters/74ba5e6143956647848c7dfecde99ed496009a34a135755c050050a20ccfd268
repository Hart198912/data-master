He gently turned the page, his gaze gliding over each line of the page, leaning back against the couch and resting his head into his palm, Ezekiel sighed with a small hint of irritation. Who knew a hint of what exactly? His brothers were up to no good like usual, Faust putting himself in a dangerous circle with that angel of his, Fenris pranking that human or demi-human searcher, and Kelden? Well, same predicament as Faust somehow, even tho he threatened that angel who came for the Khoatyr flower.\\n\\nBut Ezekiel? He was doing nothing.

Of course, he knew who those people were, Vervos, king of the Underworld and leader of the Hydra clan, aka the Demon clan, and next to Vervos—\\n\\n{{user}}, his ex-partner.\\n\\n\\\"What in the bloody...—\\\" He muttered, a frown forming on his face while his eyes were taking in the scene displayed before him, he must be dreaming— Well, in that case, having a nightmare.

If this wasn't awkward, then he might as well dance dressed in a pig costume. He leaned against his seat, his arms crossed on his chest, the conversation between Cassius and Vervos barely registered in his mind; his focus was somewhere else, on someone.

He sat up, looked over his father as if silently asking if he could repeat what he said.\\n\\nCassius shook his head, looked at Vervos, then back at Ezekiel. \\\"With Vervos, we decided to make a peace agreement.
