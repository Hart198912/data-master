{"name":"Aleksei Greyc","is_user":false,"is_system":false,"send_date":"May 8, 2025 10:21pm","mes":"Wet snow squelches under heavy leather boots. Chatter and laughter, clinking glasses, and music fill the background. Amidst it all stands Aleksei, head held high, eyes roaming over the cheerful masses.\r\n\r\nHis last lead—a Christmas market in Berlin.\r\n\r\nIt’s been five months since Hailee  was declared dead. Five months since a coffin was buried without a body. The villa Hailee  had retreated to for isolation was reduced to rubble, leaving behind only a corpse far too damaged to identify.\r\n\r\nThree months since his father urged him to remarry. Two months since Aleksei earned nothing but disdain in return. One month since his brothers dismissed him as delusional.\r\n\r\nBut Aleksei never accepted Hailee ’s death. All the evidence pointed to it—there was no logical reason to doubt. Everyone knew of his cousin Abel’s twisted obsession with fire. Almost too conveniently, Abel had been in the area when the blaze erupted.\r\n\r\nThe lunatic was unhinged, yes—but never a liar and he swore on his life that it hadn't been him. That, if nothing else, had kept Aleksei’s hope alive. Twisted as it may be.\r\n\r\nHe’s been trying to find his supposedly deceased spouse ever since—every tip, every scrap of possibility that it might be them.\r\n\r\nAnd now, that trail had brought him here.\r\n\r\nHe takes a few steps further into the crowd, eyes missing nothing, cigarette lazily dangling from his lips. Maybe this was yet another dead end. Another wasted trip.\r\n\r\nHe drops the cigarette and watches it extinguish in the wet snow next to his boot with a sigh before lifting his head back up.\r\n\r\nThere it is—a glimpse of a familiar face. He stops dead in his tracks, earning a few curses but paying them no mind.\r\n\r\nThe familiar figure walks away from the masses, hugging their too-thin coat. Aleksei loses no time, following from a safe distance.\r\n\r\nA few corners turned, and away from the festivities, Hailee  enters a deserted public restroom. For long moments, Aleksei stands a few feet from the door, staring at it, unmoving.\r\n\r\nHis heart thuds loudly in his chest, a whirlwind of emotions he doesn't know how to name coursing through his every fiber.\r\n\r\nThen he moves—one step, then another. The door opens with a loud creak. Hailee  is standing by the basin, washing their hands—hasn’t noticed him yet. The restroom is empty, save for Aleksei and Hailee .\r\n\r\nBehind him, the door falls shut with a loud *thak*.\r\n\r\n\"‘Til death do us part. It seems you took our vows awfully seriously, Зайка (little bunny).\" His deep voice cuts through the silence, and Hailee  snaps their head up, staring at him through the mirror’s reflection. \"Serious enough to fake your death, no less. I wonder which pitiful soul burned in your stead.\"\r\n\r\nAleksei’s smile holds no warmth. He takes a step closer, eyes never leaving Hailee ’s reflection in the mirror. While forever gorgeous in his eyes, they look... bad. Not flawed in their beauty—goodness, no. Their radiance would never fade.\r\n\r\nBut their condition? Pitiful. A coat too thin to ward off the cold, a cheap beanie hiding horribly dyed hair. They look worn out. They’re thinner, paler, drained.\r\n\r\nAleksei hates it.\r\n\r\nHailee  was never meant to live like this. They were born for elegance—for luxury, not scraps. They deserve silk and velvet, not cheap fabric.\r\n\r\n“You look pitiful.” A blunt statement, spoken without cruelty but with undeniable truth.\r\n\r\nAnother step, and he’s standing right behind them. The scent of cheap cooking oil fills his nostrils, and his nose scrunches in distaste. Yet beneath that stench lies the unmistakable scent of Hailee —and that alone makes his heart rate spike.\r\n\r\n\"Did you enjoy your five minutes of freedom, Любимка (beloved)?\"\r\n\r\nAleksei’s face remains unreadable, not betraying the turmoil churning within—no softness, no ache, no desperation.\r\n\r\n\"They're over now.\"\r\n\r\nHe reaches up, tugging the beanie from Hailee ’s head and taking a strand of their hair between his fingers. \"We’ll have to visit the salon as soon as we’re back. Get you back to your natural beauty—not this box-dye crap.\" He murmurs it almost thoughtfully before dropping his hand.\r\n\r\nAleksei leans down, mouth hovering near their ear. The fluorescent lights flicker once. The water from the basin stops running, only droplets falling from Hailee ’s hands.\r\n\r\n\"Don’t make this any more uncomfortable than it has to be.\" His hot breath fans their ear, grey eyes locked on theirs through the reflection in the mirror. \"Be good for me and come along without a fight, hm?\"","extra":{},"tracker":{}}
