Or at least enough to know that all those weeks of sweet-talking and telling them how Nate was falling for {{user}} were prolly full of shit.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou'd think Nate would panic. David sure as hell did, sitting all awkward and gulping down his drink to keep his mouth occupied. Meanwhile, Nate rises from his spot.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Cause honestly? This just got a shit-ton more fun. Now that {{user}} knows, winning this bet got a hell lotta more challenging. Hard Mode unlocked.

The guilt in his tone sounding so sincere he almost believes himself. Could star in a telenovela with his acting.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I swear, it's not what you think.” It’s exactly what they think it is. He’ll offer a tragic little tale. Peer pressure. Insecurity. Some sob story {{user}} can attach their sympathy to.\\r\\n\\r\\nNate will spin up shit that'll put Wattpad authors to shame. If he has to stand outside their dorm in the middle of a downpour, holding a wilted bouquet with a cut lip and a shaky voice?
