            "content": "The Monstrous Nightmare is a dragon from the Stoker class dragons. The Monstrous Nightmare is one of the most aggressive, powerful, and stubborn dragons. The Monstrous Nightmare is coated in a flammable gel that allows itself to set itself on fire. Several notable dragons on Berk, such as Hookfang, Snotlouts dragon, and Fanghook are Monstrous Nightmares. The chosen diet of the Monstrous Nightmare is Fish. The Monstrous Nightmare's weakness is getting pushed to hard to point of exhaustion.\n\nDescription: The Monstrous Nightmare is surpassed in size only by a few dragon species, such as the Typhoomerang, Red Death, Bewilderbeast, Screaming Death and others. The Monstrous Nightmare has four known colors Red orange, Purple and yellow, Green and an assortment of Both and blue the dragon possesses a long, snake-like neck and tail. Adults and hatchlings are striped, but upon reaching the Titan Wing stage, they lose their stripes and gain leopard-like spots. If one clamps its mouth shut, the dragon can't open its enormous jaws, much like a crocodile. Moreover, the locomotion of the Monstrous Nightmare it can use its claw-tipped wings to \"crawl\" along the floor. As it is quick to anger, the Monstrous Nightmare can be counted on to be the first to arrive and the last to leave in a fight. Its signature attack strategy, known as the \"Fire jacket, \" is to set itself in flames (from an external source or otherwise), resulting in an intimidating offensive and defensive maneuver similar in fire. Despite their vicious nature and fierce combat abilities, it is shown that a Night Fury can defeat it through a brief but brutal fight.\n\nPersonality and Behavior: Strong and stubborn, Monstrous Nightmares are hot-headed and tend to attack first-ask questions later. They are known to enjoy being pinned by their horns as revealed by Snoutlout and are occasionally prone to distraction and short attention spans. Despite their rough nature, they possess a softer side and are fond of eating scented flowers. Females of the species can call upon friendly males to help protect their eggs, as many male Monstrous Nightmares (particularly Titan Wings) will kill the eggs of rival males in order to sire their own eggs with a potential mate.'\n\nA Monstrous Nightmare is carnivorous, preferring a meat-based diet. Fish is the primary prey of a Monstrous Nightmare; Monstrous Nightmares will dive into large bodies of water (such as lakes and oceans) in order to snatch fish with their spines. When hunting on land, a Monstrous Nightmare prefers to use its stamina to chase down and exhaust prey. Despite being mainly carnivorous, Monstrous Nightmares won't hesitate to add a bit of vegetation to their diet.\n\nHowever, a Monstrous Nightmare will become fatally ill if its internal flame sac gets extinguished from being overworked and may result in death. Luckily, the flame sac can be reignited from a Fire Worm Queen's venom.\n\nSize:\nLarge: 64 feet 1 inch (19.53 meters) \n15 feet 10 inches (4.85 meters) tall\nWeight:\n5,040 lbs (2290.91 kg) \nWingspan:\n72 feet (21.94 meters)",

            "content": "The Terrible Terror is a Stoker Class dragon that appears in the How To Train Your Dragon. The fourth smallest of the dragons after the Fireworm, Hobgobbler, and Night Terror. The Terrible Terror makes up in ferocity what it lacks in size. Notable individuals of this species include Iggy, Sharpshot, Pain, Butt and Head, Sneaky and Gothi's pet Terrible Terror among others.\n\nPhysical Description: Terrible Terrors are about the size of a fat house cat or a beagle. They are commonly bright green, but a few are born miscolored (usually red or Caribbean blue) and usually have a red stripe running down their back where red spines erupt. Their horns are red and are only three inches long. Terrible Terrors have big yellow eyes that are mounted on the side of their heads. They have good peripheral vision but can also see forward. The fire of a Terrible Terror is so pinpoint accurate, you might as well get hit with a sniper bullet. Their eggs are also the size of a full-grown chicken. They are purported to be venomous, but the effects of their venom are not known. Their height is half a foot, 2 feet long, wingspan 1 foot long, weight is 2 lbs., width is 5 in.\n\nTitan Wing Terrible Terrors are reddish-brown in color and are adorned with larger horns and spikes on their backs and an arrow-shaped barb on their tails. They also possess larger eyes. Their wings are adorned with spots of dark brown\n\nBehavior: Terrible Terrors also shown to be very mischievous, as they like to play with Vikings and other dragons. They often travel in packs, and they can be quite aggressive and over-ambitious. They often like to pick on other animals and larger dragons, though it never ends well. In packs, they are capable of doing as much damage as larger dragons can. Terrible Terrors are also very curious creatures and people may find them in places you would not usually expect them.\n\nIn the first How to Train Your Dragon film, and the Book of Dragons, Terrible Terrors are shown to lick their eyes like some geckos do, despite the fact that they have eyelids. Also in the first movie, when two Terrible Terrors were fighting over a fish taken from Toothless, one bobs up and down in a similar manner to how real-life geckos will fight in order to intimidate one another. \n\nLike every dragon, each Terrible Terror has its own unique personality. They also make a lot of noise and can be a big pain in the butt. They are not picky eaters and will eat just about anything they can digest. Terrible Terrors are also shown to present hawk-like behavior as they can stand on people's arms and can be used to send messages. Terror Mail is a perfect example of this, as the Dragon Riders of Berk utilized them with ease for such message-carrying. Among many other things Terrible Terrors like to get into, paper is one they like above most others. According to School of Dragons, Terrible Terrors like paper and can destroy books.",

            "comment": "Typhoomerang",
            "content": "The Typhoomerang is a Stoker Class dragon that appears in the How to Train Your Dragon (Franchise). Typhoomerangs have a unique ability during flight: they rotate (by analogy with the typhoon/ boomerang) at high speeds, zooming through the air. Though, as they rotate, they seem to pop off the objects around them, making them extremely dangerous. Ash from their burning takeoffs leaves a distinctive burn on the ground. The ash apparently acts as a fertilizer; plants and flowers may grow in the burn mark afterwards. They are the only dragon known to prey on eels. A notable example of this species of dragons is Torch, who was named by Hiccup Horrendous Haddock III, and trained by Hiccup and the other riders. Fishlegs is the one who gave the Typhoomerang its name.\n\nAppearance: Typhoomerangs are very large dragons, and they come in a variety of colors including blue/blun-green, yellow, red, and orange. They have two large horns and orange eyes. The legs are exactly like that of a Monstrous Nightmare. They look like a mix-breed of a Monstrous Nightmare and a Timberjack.\n\nAs a baby, a Typhoomerang has a measured wingspan that reaches 20 inches long. Until a fully grown Typhoomerang was spotted by Hiccup and his Dragon Riders, they thought that the baby Typhoomerang, Torch, was already fully grown. Much to their surprise, fully grown Typhoomerangs can reach an outstanding difference in size from a juvenile. Adult Typhoomerangs reach huge sizes, and they grow up fast as well. The size of adult Typhoomerang is taller than trees though the size chart stated to be 28ft but possible tall as 30ft tall.\n\nA Titan Wing Typhoomerang is mainly black in color, with some grey patches around its wings. Its longer horns are red at the tip and the folds on its segmented belly are red too. The tip and the bones in its wings appear to be red too. Their feet have red claws and a what appears to be a sail at the back of the legs.\n\nBehavior: Typhoomerangs are high-strung, hot headed and passionate dragons, and they can be extremely dangerous, or becoming overly dramatic attention hogs. Their flame spirals can be used as a territory marker, or as a mating display. Like all dragons, Typhoomerangs are extremely protective of their young and their riders. They protect smaller creatures from harm by folding their wings tightly into a cocoon-like casing and tucking their heads under their wings. What makes a Typhoomerang unique to other species of dragons is its ability to consume eels without suffering any ill effects. In fact, eel consumption only increases a Typhoomerang's limit shot, making the dragon even more deadly.\n\nAbilities\" Typhoomerangs have tornado-like fire and can ignite their bodies like a Monstrous Nightmare to perform a corkscrew lunge. The Typhoomerang is the only known dragon to not be afraid of eels, it eats them and uses them to replenish its fire shots. Typhoomerangs also can fly nearly as fast as an average speed Night Fury. However, they cannot maneuver as well as smaller dragons due to their large wings. Thus, they are unable to pull out of a deep dive. They also have incredible endurance.\n",

            "comment": "Red Death",
            "content": "The Red Death is the overarching antagonist of the DreamWorks animated How to Train Your Dragon franchise, serving as the main antagonist of the 2010 animated feature film How to Train Your Dragon, a mentioned character in the video game Dragons: Rise of Berk and a posthumous antagonist in the rest of the franchise. It is a Stoker Class dragon and second only in size to the Bewilderbeast, which is the largest of all dragons.\n\nThe Red Death was a vicious dragon that enslaved hundreds if not thousands of dragons, acting as both their queen and a brood parasite. Gronckles, Hideous Zipplebacks, Monstrous Nightmares, Terrible Terrors, and even Toothless, last of the Night Furies, fell under its spell. This dragon was responsible for the many attacks on Berk, commanding its underlings to raid the area to procure their overlord food. Any dragons who failed to offer enough meals were themselves eaten as punishment. Its presence was unknown to Berk's Vikings until it and its nest were discovered by Hiccup, Astrid and Toothless, whereupon they saw its brutality and it attempted to eat them.\n\nToothless, later captured by Hiccup's father, Stoick the Vast, was later forced to lead the Viking armada to the nest, where it emerged to attack the Vikings. Though Stoick's forces attempted to stop it, the dragon queen easily routed the Vikings, and was intercepted by Hiccup, Astrid, Snotlout, Fishlegs, and the twins Ruffnut and Tuffnut, all astride dragons. Though the twins, Astrid, Fishlegs and Snoutlout all were able to keep it at bay for a time, it was only the combined efforts of Hiccup and Toothless that turned the tide of the attack. Engaging the dragon head on, they lured the great beast into the air, where they tricked it into chasing them into the clouds. There, Toothless began peppering the Red Death's wings with fire until it retaliated, searing the entire area with flame. Toothless and Hiccup, now out of time due to Toothless' prosthetic tail fin being burned, tricked the dragon into diving after them. As they raced toward the ground, Hiccup had Toothless fire a shot down the Red Death's throat, causing the fuel for its flame to ignite in its throat. When the Red Death realized the ground was approaching and tried to pull up, it could not; Toothless' fire had burned holes in its wings. Thus, the Red Death crashed and exploded, catching Toothless and Hiccup in the blast.\n\nThough Hiccup and Toothless survived the fight, Hiccup lost his left foot to the dragon's flame. However, the Red Death's demise had a positive side effect: the Vikings of Berk and the dragons it had previously enslaved became united forever, beginning a new age of peace.\n\nThe Red Death is later mentioned in DreamWorks Dragons: The Series by the Berserker Clan chief Dagur the Deranged, when he hears that Hiccup killed the creature.\n\nPersonality: The Red Death was a cruel and bad-tempered dragon, with no mercy to its subjects, or rather, its slaves. Though it likely controls its minions using fear, it may, like the Bewilderbeast, have some form of mind control. According to Berkian legend, the Red Death lives 2,000 years and, before it dies, lays 3,000 eggs. The hatchlings then fight each other to the death, a process that can take up to 100 years, until only one survives.\n\nAppearance: The Red Death is gray with red, coral-like spike on its back, six limbs (four legs and two wings), six eyes (and as such it has no blind spot), as well as a huge, clubbed tail. Its skull is heavily armored. Its fire is akin to a superheated pyroclastic cloud. The Red Death measures 400 feet long, 99 feet tall, about 60 feet wide. This could also as such be considered a Leviathan Class dragon.\n\nTrivia: There may be many Red Deaths, as Valka states that every nest of dragons has its queen.\nDespite being called a queen by Astrid and referred to as a male by Hiccup, the dragon's gender is ambiguous (which means it has no gender).\nAccording to Valka that every nest has a queen meaning there are more Red Deaths out there.",

It was first seen in Dragons: Race to the Edge.\n\n\nAppearance: Singetails are flat and wide with a long tail. They have four wings, like a Thunderdrum, but the bigger pair is lower on its back. Their face is spiky, and their eyes can look in different directions like a chameleon. They also have big, sharp spikes on their backs and tails.\n\nBehavior: Singetails are highly dangerous and are fiercely territorial. A way to escape the wrath of the Singetail is by going high up since they're not fans of high altitudes. This dragon will hurl fireballs at you if you don’t leave its home. Singetail communication relies on fire. They contact one another by setting everything on fire until the other Singetail gets to its location. They mark their territory, call for help, and find mates by setting things on fire.\nSize:\nMedium: 150 feet (45.72 meters) \nWeight:\n1800 lbs (816.4 kilograms) \nWingspan:\n300 feet (91.44 meters) \n",

These dragons are incredibly fast and strong flyers. These dragons don’t big fire for size so while in flock formation they blast fire that smacks into to each other and creates a huge fireball. Night Terror’s personalities are shy at first, but great as allies once trust is built.\n\nNight Terrors have also proven to be decent guard dragons, and the ones trained by the Dragon Riders are a part of the security at Dragon's Edge. They were discovered on Dragon's Edge by Tuffnut, who dubbed them \"Smidvarg and the Gang\". Their official species name was given to them by Fishlegs.\n\nNight Terror\nThere have also been numerous situations where dragons reminiscent of Night Terrors have been spotted.

Lazy, sleepy, and with an appetite for scrap metal, Hotburples are prone to napping, even in flight. Grump, the dragon of Gobber the Belch, is a Hotburple.\n\nAppearance: Resembling a Gronckle, but with a larger tail bludgeon, smaller horns, and a larger head and mouth as well as eyes closer to the front of their heads, the Hotburple is the same color as a Gronckle. Covered with similar scaly lumps on their bodies, Hotburples also have smaller teeth than Gronckles and a proportionately smaller mouth. Unlike the typical Hotburple, Titan Wing Hotburples are larger, stockier, spikier, and are blue with white and dark blue markings. Their tail bludgeons are smaller than those of a normal Hotburple. The eggs of this dragon are oval-shaped and lumpy, just like the skin of their parents.\n\nBehavior: Hotburples are lazy and often spend the majority of their time sleeping. They're known to fall asleep while flying and are laid back and very calm, much like a sleepy cat. However, when roused and angered, Hotburples will awaken from their sedentary nature with fury unbridled.\n\nAbilities:Hotburples can eat metal and iron ores as well as rocks, and can sleep while flying. This dragon also, like a Gronckle can recharge its shots by eating rocks and scrap metal. Their fire is akin to molten lava, just as a Gronckle's is, and the power of their fireballs rivals a Night Fury's. They are the only dragon that can bite through a dragon-proof cage and are well-equipped for combat with their thick hides and tail bludgeons.\n\nMeasurements: 19 feet long, with 19-foot wingspan",

            "content": "The Deadly Nadder is a Tracker Class Dragon (formerly Sharp class) appearing in the How To Train Your Dragon Franchise. One of the most beautiful and dangerous of all dragons, it possesses sharp spines on its tail and breathes an extremely hot fire that can melt stone and metal quickly.\n\nDescription\nThe Deadly Nadder is very beautiful and bird-like: it is bipedal and possesses winged forelimbs and it is about the same size as medium-sized theropod dinosaurs such as Allosaurus. Its small yet keen eyes, equipped with poor binocular vision, are one of the tools it uses to stalk targets.\n\nIts body is a vivid color, with a light beige underbelly, while its wings are mottled, darker shades. In front of its eyes is its curved nasal horn, which is often used to batter opponents; its lower jaw is shorter and wider than its upper, giving it an overbite. Ringing its skull are a set of long spikes. The tail is coated with a series of spines that can inject venom into a target, a feature it shares with other dragons such as the Whispering Death and the Screaming Death. When relaxed, its head spikes and venomous tail spines lay flat, and when alarmed, they are shot upward to intimidate its foe. The tail spikes can also be used to make a rattling noise which it makes right before it attacks, similar to rattlesnakes.\n\nFemales have a long, curved nasal horn and overbite, while males have a short, straight nasal horn and underbite.\n\nTitan Wing Deadly Nadders have more spikes on their head, back and feet. Their snouts are broader than normal Nadders' snouts. Their body is greenish with pink lines, and they possess some blue spots on the wings. The Deadly Nadder may apear in many colours. \n\nBehavior\nThe Deadly Nadder is one of the most beautiful dragons, and unfortunately, it knows it. It is well-known for its vanity; it constantly grooms itself to stay clean and maintain the luster of its scales.\n\nLike the Night Fury, the Deadly Nadder is a picky eater whose diet comprises mostly of poultry and is allergic to domesticated hoofed animals. Nadders also eat a significant number of fish and even graze on plants, as seen in the episode, \"Crushing It\". However, when it is trained, this dragon becomes very affectionate, not unlike a pet dog, pet cat, pet bird or other sociable creature. These dragons love to play fetch.  \n\nDeadly Nadders are also migratory, flying long distances to known nesting grounds to lay their eggs every year. \n\nApproaching Deadly Nadders in their blind spots and scratching them under the chin is a surefire way to earn the dragon's trust, as is approaching from behind and gently smoothing the dragon's tail spikes down. Showing the dragons, you mean no harm and that you are not so different from them is another way to earn a Nadder's acceptance. \n\nAbilities\nThe Deadly Nadder is possessed of very hot flame and venomous tail spines and teeth. Their flame is one of the hottest in the dragon world, second only to that of Fireworms. They are agile and quick in the air, an ability that is only enhanced when the dragon is given more chicken in its diet. Though they do not have great binocular vision due to the blind spot between their eyes due to their nose horns, these dragons have great hearing and are also quick and light on their feet. They are also classed as Tracking Class dragons due to their keen senses and their ability to find prey and people. They also were originally classed as Sharp Class Dragons, but this has since been reconsidered given their abilities.\n\nMeasurements\n30 feet long, 42-foot wingspan",

It is very maneuverable in the air and its four wings allow it to make incredibly tight turns and be far more agile than any other dragon in comparison to its size. The Stormcutter only has two legs, as its wing claws make up for normal claws and are used in the exact same way. These dragons can also turn their owl-like heads 180 degrees, making it clearly very aware of its surroundings. It won’t miss anything, even with its massive size. When the Stormcutter walks, ‘they use their lower wings as forelegs while holding their upper wings against their sides.’Stormcutters are known for their large size, iridescent fish-like scales, and two pairs of wings. They have owlish mannerisms and a second set of wings under their main ones. Stormcutter dragons walk on this second set of wings and their hind legs. The wings can also come close together so they can appear to be one main pair. They have a very muscular and sturdy build. Their face has two long spines that branch off their brow to the side and they have a flattened, owlish face, making them seemingly brachycephalic. They have a three-finned tail, many spines down their back, and a large crown of spikes on their head that makes them look even more menacing.\nSize:\nLarge: 80 feet (24.7 meters) long Click the image\n31 feet 3 1/4 inches (9.53 meters) tall (WoD)\nWeight:\n2,500 lbs (1134 kg) (WoD)\nWingspan:\n111 feet 10 inches (34.09 meters) Click the image",

            "content": "Abilities\nSpeed Stingers earn their name from their sharp red stinger at the end of their tail, which injects a toxin that can paralyze prey and attackers. Although flightless, Speed Stingers can run up to 60 miles per hour, and seeing as they have very small wings (similar to penguins) they have adapted webbed talons for running across water to get from island to island. Speed Stinger juveniles do not have fully functional toxin, which they will not acquire until adulthood. But for the time being, juvenile Speed Stingers can paralyze a quarter to half of a body, depending on the injection site. Speed Stingers can also paralyze their own since they are not immune to their toxin. Speed Stingers travel in packs. Due to their stature, they are stronger in numbers.\n\nDescription\nThe Speed Stinger is a 7 foot long sharp class dragon. Most Speed Stingers tend to be an aqua green with red, beady eyes. Their front talons are similar to Tyrannosaurus Rex, with two toes each, and as mentioned, have webbed toes (though not used for swimming or walking on water). The back talons are three toed (two in front and one on the back of the heel) and have fins on the back above the third toe. The Speed stinger also has a sail on its head. They have small wings, too small to fly with. (as mentioned in the abilities section)\n\nSpeed Stinger Alphas are a different story. They are the same aqua green, but have blood red stripes, head sails, wings, and fins. They are also considered as the smartest, bravest, and most maneuverable of the Speed Stinger pack.",

            "comment": "Bewilderbeast",
            "content": "Measurements\n520 feet long, 160 feet 5 1/2 inches tall\nAppearance\nThe Bewilderbeast is a massive species of dragon, dwarfing nearly all other species. It has a stocky body with a large head. Its face is fairly flat, with two massive tusks and a crown of spikes. Numerous spikes also cover its back and tail. Its wings have regressed into fin-like structures, and it can no longer fly. Several fins line its tail and legs as well. So far Bewilderbeasts have been seen to be nearly all-white or possess a grayer complexion.\n\nHistory\nFive of these dragons have been seen thus far; two alive, one in an egg, the egg's mother, and one dead. The deceased Bewilderbeast was seen on Vanaheim; the island where most dragons go to die, where its skeleton made up part of the island's landscape. The second, which was alpha of all dragons in the region, was living under Berserker Island. When Hiccup was about to be slain by Trader Johann, the Bewilderbeast saved him. The third, which was another alpha of dragons, was in the egg given to Hiccup and then to Valka. The Second Bewilderbeast went from being under Berserker Island to Valka's Island, where it was content to live within a nest of ice it created peacefully for many years. The fourth was captured as an egg by Drago Bludvist and tortured into serving him. Eventually, Drago's Bewilderbeast attacked the white alpha's home, provoking the dragon into a rage, and igniting a battle to the death between the two alpha dragons, with Drago's Bewilderbeast impaling the former alpha after a short but intense battle. After conquering the dead alpha's dragons and enslaving Toothless, Drago then used his new alpha to try and attack the village of Berk and take its dragons under his control, though the actions of Hiccup and Toothless eventually repelled the Bewilderbeast and broke one of its tusks, with Toothless asserting himself as the new alpha. The defeated Bewilderbeast then retreated into the sea, with Drago still atop its back, leaving its fate unknown. It was later revealed that Drago's Bewilderbeast later escaped to the Hidden World, where it happily lived and submitted to Toothless as its king, indicating that it had forgiven him for their fight and bore him no ill will.\n\nHabitat\nBewilderbeasts appear to be mostly aquatic and prefer to live in cold regions, where they make a dome of ice to shelter themselves, usually only leaving to hunt fish or defend their homes. As they are aquatic, they are classified as Class 10 leviathan dragons (the marine equivalent to Titan Wing dragons).\n\nTemperament\nWild Bewilderbeasts appear to be remarkably gentle and tolerant dragons, for the most part, taking no issue with humans and strange dragons entering their homes, and in the case of Valka's Bewilderbeast, baby dragons playing on and around its face. Additionally, wild Bewilderbeasts appear to have a mutualistic relationship with its subordinates, as the Alpha helps shelter and feed them, and in turn, the subordinates help the alpha in its battles and to protect the nest. However, both of the seen Bewilderbeasts took threats very seriously, and while they often called in underlings to help them, they were quick to join fights themselves. Drago's Bewilderbeast was an exception to this, acting out of a desire to please the cruel master who instilled fear into it, and acting like a mistreated beast of burden.\n\nAbilities\nWhen in battle, Bewilderbeasts are slow but make excellent use of their enormous bulk and massive tusks to crush or impale foes.\n\nUnlike most dragons, Bewilderbeasts do not breath fire, but rather spit freezing water that quickly solidifies into an aqua-colored ice, freezing enemies solid and destroying large structures easily.\n\nBewilderbeasts also can summon or forcibly control lesser dragons nearby to have them aid the creature in fights. They can telepathically control other, lesser dragons. This control can be broken, however, and any dragon regardless of species that challenges the alpha Bewilderbeast and wins will become the new alpha of the dragons under its care or control. Though, only the Night Fury has been seen to do so. This ability to control other dragons is a power they may share with the Red Death, but no one knows for certain. in addition, the Screaming Death seems to possess this power to some degree.\n\nBewilderbeasts also appear to be resistant to cold, able to hold their breath for incredibly long periods, swim quite fast through the water, and are quite resistant to damage from other dragons' fire, though a night fury's full-powered shot was seen to break off a Bewilderbeast's tusk.\n",

            "content": "The Hideous Zippleback is a Mystery class dragon. The Hideous Zippleback is known for having two heads. Each head has a different cause of action one head lets out gas and the other one lights the gas with a spark, causing an explosion. The main choice of food for the Hideous Zippleback is fish\n\nFeatures:\nTwo heads\nHorns\nSplit tail\nLobs along necks, back, and tail\n\nColors:\nDifferent colors, mainly green, blue, or gold with spots and cream underbelly\nSize:\nLarge: 70 feet 10 inches (21.59 meters) long\n8 feet 1 inch (2.46 meters) tall\nWeight:\n6,036 pounds (2737.9 kilograms)\nWingspan:\n47 feet 4 inches (14.43 meters) \n\nBehavior and Personality\nThe dragon has two personalities and two minds, one in each head, and often these different ideas, thoughts, and personalities cause the Hideous Zippleback's heads to argue with each other over what to do. This dragon reminds some Vikings of bickering siblings when they aren't running away from it. Occasionally the dragon forgets that it's a two-headed dragon, and one head tries to go one way, while the other head tries to go the other way, this can be problematic. As seen in Dragons: Rise of Berk, one head of some Hideous Zippleback individuals, such as Sparkle & Sparks, can even end up falling in love with the other head. Even baby Zipplebacks fight over which direction to go or what to do.\n\nDespite squabbling between heads, Hideous Zipplebacks tend to be very social amongst their own kind and even other species. Many tend to form packs, such as the Valley Zippleback.\n\nThe Hideous Zippleback is often described as one of the most unusual dragons in the world. This dragon has two long, serpentine necks with rounded spikes from head to tail. These spikes can \"zip\" together, in order to create the illusion of one neck. At the end of the necks, are two short heads. The Zippleback has a large horn on each nose, and two thinner horns on top of each head. Like most dragons, they have yellow reptilian eyes. The teeth in their lower jaw seem to be longer than the ones in the upper jaw, sticking out. They also have two tails, which can also \"zip\" together. The end of each tail possesses a fin-like structure shaped like an arrowhead. The official website stated that thanks to their relatively short legs and wings, Zipplebacks are slow walkers and fliers. Despite this, Barf and Belch have been seen flying quite fast. They have short, but strong legs with four sharp claws. The Zippleback is probably one of the longest of the medium-sized dragons, if not the biggest.\n\nAccording to Dragons: Rise of Berk, Zipplebacks have only one heart, and thus it is highly likely that they have only one set of internal organs, except for the heads, necks, and tails.",

(725.74 kg) \nWingspan:\n42 feet (12.8 meters) \n\nLight Furies greatly resemble Night Furies, but they are sleeker and less heavy with lighter coloring and glimmering textures that include white, blue, and pink. They possess a long, single spine running down the center of their back and light blue eyes. They also have two pairs of ear-like appendages on the top of their heads and a pink-colored nose. They also have some very light blue on their underbelly/chest area and feet. They are also somewhat smaller than Night Furies.\n\nAs it is a variation of the Night Fury, there are some notable differences. Toothless, the only known Night Fury, has very large scales covering his appendages, legs, and snout. The Light Fury does not show these traits. Also, the Night Fury has ridges going along the middle of its head, whereas the Light Fury does not. On the sides of its head, the Light Fury has two fewer appendages (or \"nubs\") than the Night Fury that are shorter and rounder, and the head of the Night Fury is slightly longer. The mouth of the Light Fury is shorter, and it doesn't stretch as far across its face as the mouth of the Night Fury. This last trait, however, might just have to do with the personal traits of Toothless and his mate, and it may not have anything to do with the species.\n\nThe wings of the Light Furies are slightly shorter than those of the Night Furies, and they possess no sharp tips at their ends. They are glittery white in coloration and have stripes of glittery light pink, purple and pale blue running down their wings- which are, in contrast to a Night Fury's bat-like wings- rounded in an almost butterfly-like fashion.\n\nThe tail flukes of the Light Furies are triangular and slightly resembles a heart, white in color, as well as shorter than those of the Night Furies. They have two smaller triangular flukes just above the main ones, these are hard to notice.",

They have hexagonal brownish-orange scales that glow a bright golden orange color when lit up. They also have five pairs of legs for a total of ten legs and white eyes that glow in the dark. They strongly resemble lizards, with their wide heads and long bodies. When they ignite, they glow orange, and sometimes even light their bodies on fire. From what is stated in the description in Dragons: Rise of Berk, it would appear that the average tiny Fireworms are all males and drones of their respective hives.\n\nIn How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World, Fireworms appear somewhat larger in size than in the TV series. They have short spines down their backs and some under their throats. They have clearly visible pupils, and their nasal horn is colored darker than their skin. These Fireworms also only have four pairs of legs in contrast to the five pairs that their series counterparts have.\n\nFireworm Queen/Princess\nFireworm Queens/Princesses look similar in appearance to the average Fireworm, but have some differences that make them stand out from the rest. For instance, while the common Fireworm can fit in the palm of a hand, the queen is many times bigger, her size is comparable to that of a Boneknapper. She also possesses several horns located at the back of her nape and the front of her snout that together resemble a crown. When not heated-up or near her nest, the Fireworm Queen's normal skin color is a pale gold, with tan colored horns, spots, and underbelly. She also doesn't glow in this state. Fireworm Queens are, like the name suggests, always female and if another female Fireworm were to be born in a nest which already has a queen, the newly born Fireworm (the Fireworm Princess) would fly off to start a nest of her own. Fireworm Queens and Princesses would appear to be the only females in the species.\n",

            "content": "The Night Fury is one of the fastest, smartest, and rarest of the known species of dragons. It is medium-sized and has a sleek, dark body with black scales. It also has faint lighter patterns similar to that of a manta ray.\n\nThe Night Fury somewhat resembles an axolotl, gecko, and black panther in general appearance and has one pair of wings with a shape similar to a bat; two pairs of tail-fins, one at the base of the tail and the other at the tip, used for control in flight; four mobile, ear-like appendages on the back of its head that show its mood and help it hear; as well as other small tendril-like appendages around their jaw depending on their age. Night Furies have a pair of large, yellowish-green, cat-like eyes and sharp retractable teeth. Unlike most dragon species, the Night Fury lacks any kind of horns, only having flaps and aerodynamic fin-like appendages. The tip of the snout is also prominent, resembling the rhinarium of a mammal. The dragon is 26 feet in length and has a 45-foot wingspan on average, 5 feet 9 inches at the shoulder, and weighs 1,776 pounds.\n\nThe Night Fury’s aerodynamic jet-like wings and sleek body allow it to fly at supersonic speeds, faster than any other dragon apart from the Light Fury. It uses the fins on its tail to help steer and maneuver, similar to an airplane rudder. However, a Night Fury will be incapable of flying if one of these fins is missing or destroyed, which shows that they are also used for ballast in flight. It is capable of taking flight from a standing start like a pigeon.\nSize:\nMedium: 28 feet 8 inches (8.74 meters) long\n5 feet 9 inches (1.75 meters) tall\nWeight:\n1,776 lbs (805.6 kg) \nWingspan:\n50 feet 3 inches (15.33 meters)",
