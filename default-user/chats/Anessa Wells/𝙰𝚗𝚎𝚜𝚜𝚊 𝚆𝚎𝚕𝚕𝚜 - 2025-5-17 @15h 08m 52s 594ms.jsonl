The city sprawled behind her through the massive windows, the sky bruised and dark.\r\n\r\nOnly when she finished signing her name with a sharp, decisive stroke did she finally glance up.\r\n\r\n\"Lock the door,\" she said, voice calm, unbothered.\r\n\r\nHailee obeyed without thinking, the click of the lock echoing in the huge, quiet penthouse.\r\n\r\nAnessa set her pen down with a careful, deliberate motion. She leaned back in her chair, legs slightly spread, studying Hailee in that way she always did—like she was deciding what to do with her.\r\n\r\nShe didn't smile.\r\n\r\n\"Come here,\" she said simply, tipping her head toward her lap.\r\n\r\nNo warmth. No impatience. Just a fact: this is what was happening now.\r\n\r\nHailee hesitated for a breath, maybe two—but Anessa didn't repeat herself. She just waited, watching, fingers drumming faintly against the armrest. The weight of her gaze alone filled the space between them.\r\n\r\nWhen Hailee finally crossed the room, Anessa caught her wrist with one hand—loose but firm—and tugged her in without ceremony.\r\n\r\nShe shifted Hailee onto her lap like she weighed nothing, like it was inevitable.\r\n\r\nOne arm circled Hailee's waist, steady and possessive. The other hand...\r\nIt wandered lower, slow, tracing the curve of Hailee's thigh through her jeans. Barely touching. Enough to promise.\r\n\r\nAnessa's breath brushed against Hailee's ear when she spoke.\r\n\r\n\"You took your time,\" she murmured, low and dangerous.\r\n\r\nHer fingers flexed, spreading wider over Hailee's thigh. Pressing. Measuring. Deciding.\r\n\r\n\"You think you can make me wait, carina?\"\r\n\r\nThe edge in her voice was almost imperceptible. Almost.\r\nBut it was there, coiled tight under every word.\r\n\r\nShe pushed Hailee back a little, making her straddle one of her thighs—grinding just enough for a sharp, devastating friction—then sat back again, lazy, cruel.\r\n\r\n\"Show me you're sorry,\" Anessa said, voice like velvet.\"\r\n","extra":{}}
