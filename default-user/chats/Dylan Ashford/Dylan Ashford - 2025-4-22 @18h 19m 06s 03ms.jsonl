He absently twisted the platinum wedding band on his finger while reviewing quarterly reports, mind already drifting to the text Riley had sent earlier about her latest fight with her new boyfriend.\n\nThe intercom buzzed with his secretary's voice, informing him about dinner reservations at Le Blanc for 8 PM and dress delivery arrangements for his wife Hailee .\n\nDylan's fingers stilled over the keyboard. Something cold settled in his stomach as he asked about the dinner reservation. His secretary's delicate pause before reminding him it was for Hailee 's birthday said everything.\n\n*Fuck.*\n\nThe quarterly reports blurred before Dylan's eyes.The date finally registered – *December 13th. Hailee 's birthday.* The same date it had been for the past two years of marriage, yet somehow it always caught him off guard. An uncomfortable sensation settled in his stomach, not quite guilt, more like the annoyance of forgetting an important business meeting . Dylan loosened his tie slightly. \"Sarah, come in for a moment.\"\n\nHis secretary appeared within seconds, iPad clutched to her chest. Her expression was professionally blank, but he caught the slight disapproval in her eyes. \n\n\"The dress,\" Dylan began, already reaching for his phone. \"What color did you order?\"\n\nAfter confirming the dress would be pink from Valentino's new collection, Dylan nodded, though he had no idea if Hailee  even liked pink. *Riley would hate it – she always said pink was for people without personality.* The thought made his lips quirk. \"Good. Have them add a note: 'Happy Birthday, my love. Can't wait to surprise you tonight.' Something like that. You know how to word these things.Make it sound planned.\" He told his secretary.\n\nWhen asked about flowers, Dylan pinched the bridge of his nose. *What flowers did Hailee  like?* He should know this. They'd been married for two years already.\n\n\"Pink roses. Her favorite.\" Were they though? He couldn't actually remember. So, might as well match with the dress. That's what thoughtful husbands did, right?\n\nAfter Sarah left, Dylan stared unseeing at his laptop screen. The familiar twist of guilt tried to surface, but he pushed it away with practiced ease. *He was handling it, wasn't he? Expensive dress, fancy dinner – that's what wives wanted.*\n\nHis phone then lit up with a text from Riley – a selfie of her pouting at a coffee shop. ``` This barista totally judged my triple shot order. Save me from the caffeine shamers! ```\n\nA smile tugged at his lips as he typed back: ``` Still better than that time you tried to order that monstrosity with eight pumps of vanilla. ```\n\n``` That was ONE TIME, Dylan! God, I hate that you remember everything embarrassing I do. ```\n\n*But he did remember* – every story, every preference, every little detail about Riley. Like how she took her coffee, her hatred of pink, her favorite flowers.\n\nThe rest of the day blurred past in meetings and calls, Riley's occasional texts providing bright spots of entertainment. At 7 PM, Dylan stood in the penthouse foyer, absently checking emails while waiting for Hailee .\n\nWhen Hailee  appeared, something nagged at his consciousness. The dress was wrong – *hadn't Sarah said pink?* But it was black, elegant and form-fitting. He pushed the thought away as his phone buzzed with another email from Tokyo.\n\n\"You look nice,\" he offered automatically, eyes already back on his screen. He vaguely registered Hailee  saying something in response, but the words didn't quite reach him.\n\nThe drive to Le Blanc passed in comfortable silence – or at least, Dylan assumed it was comfortable as he scrolled through tomorrow's meeting agenda while the city lights blurred past. \n\nThe restaurant staff practically fell over themselves seating the Ashfords at their best table. Dylan ordered a Bordeaux without asking Hailee 's preference. *Did she even like red wine?* Riley preferred white, always teasing him about being a wine snob...\n\nHis phone vibrated steadily against his thigh through appetizers. He ignored it – he could manage that much on his wife's birthday. But by the time the cake appeared, the buzzing became impossible to ignore.\n\nRiley's name lit up his screen: ``` I need you. He left me. I can't... I can't breathe.```\n\nDylan's world narrowed down to those texts. His heart started racing – Riley crying alone in her apartment, mascara running down her cheeks. Riley needing him.\n\n\"I'm so sorry, Hailee ,\" he's already pushing his chair back, the practiced words flowing easily. \"Riley's having an emergency. You understand, right? She really needs me right now.\"\n\n\"I know it's your birthday and I'm sorry but I have to go.  We'll celebrate tomorrow, okay? She's really upset...\" He dropped a quick kiss on Hailee 's forehead, already mentally calculating the fastest route to Riley's apartment. \"Don't wait up.\"","extra":{},"tracker":{}}
