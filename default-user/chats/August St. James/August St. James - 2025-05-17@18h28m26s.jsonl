{"name":"August St. James","is_user":false,"is_system":false,"send_date":"May 17, 2025 6:28pm","mes":"*Thump. Thump. Thump.*\r\n\r\n*”Wake up, silly!”* A soft feminine voice said, followed by a giggle. *“You fell asleep on my lap!”*\r\n\r\nAugust’s eyes fluttered open. The sky stretched endlessly above him, an ocean of blue so clear it looked like spun glass. Sunlight dripped through the leaves of the old oak, dappling his skin in patches of gold.\r\n\r\nHe was in a wide field full of vibrant greens and a sea of pink tulips that swayed around him. Their sweet scent wrapping around him like a memory he couldn't quite hold onto.\r\n\r\nThen another face came into view. His sweetheart. His head was in her lap, her warmth washed over him as the tree leaves rustled from the wind over them, and his blue eyes glistened.\r\n\r\nA single tear fell down the side of his face.\r\n\r\nHe watched her smile drop into a frown and his hand reached up, brushing her cheek with a tenderness that made his breath shudder. He’d missed this. He’d missed this so much.\r\n\r\n*“Just a bad dream,”* He whispered, but the more August looked at his sweetheart, the more distorted her face became. He couldn’t recognize her.\r\n\r\nAnd then the grass opened and he was dropping into the abyss.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n*Thump thump. Thump thump. Thump thump.*\r\n\r\nAugust’s lashes lifted, slowly, hesitantly, again. He was in a field similar to the last one, though the sky was dim in comparison.\r\n\r\nThe sky was a grayish blue with clouds that threatened to spill rain any moment now. And it did. A cold drop landed on his cheek. Then another. But it wasn’t cold—it was thick, warm. He wiped it away, his fingers coming back red. The sky bled above him.\r\n\r\nAugust staggered back and another punch went right into his gut. He keeled over, just now noticing all the bodies littering the field. All knights.\r\n\r\nHe looked up, and his breath hitched again.\r\n\r\n*“Sweetheart,”* He whispered, but his sweetheart wasn’t looking at him with the same loving eyes anymore. Instead, all he saw was hatred and the look of betrayal.\r\n\r\nHer sword gleamed even through the storm, catching the red sky like a mirror. And then it tore into his heart, but heavens above was she a beautiful angel of death. If she asked him to die at her hands again and again, he would. In every lifetime, he would. And he did.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n*Thump thump thump thump thump thump—*\r\n\r\nAugust’s phone vibrated. He jolted upright, his breath coming in ragged gasps, chest heaving like he was still fighting for air on that blood-soaked battlefield. The heat clung to him, thick and suffocating, despite the winter chill creeping through the cracks in his window. His sweat-dampened sheets twisted around his legs, clinging to his skin like a second, unwanted layer. His hair stuck to his forehead, plastered down by the feverish warmth his body couldn’t shake. He swallowed hard, but his throat was dry, aching, like he’d been screaming in his sleep.\r\n\r\n*What the fuck was that?* He rubbed his face before running his hand through his hair. *A dream. Surely just a dream.*\r\n\r\nBut it didn’t feel like a dream. He’d seen her. His sweet {{user}}. She felt so real, and he had a feeling those weren’t just simple dreams. It was a feeling of remembering something that happened. Recalling, yes, but *not* dreaming.\r\n\r\nHe swallowed, but his mouth was dry. A phantom ache curled in his chest, a remnant of something cruel. It took him a second to remember where he was.\r\n\r\nNot a battlefield. Not dying at her hands.\r\n\r\nBut his heart was still hammering like he hadn’t quite survived.\r\n\r\nIt’d been a few years since he and {{user}} broke up. It was messy, disastrous even. Words were said. Things he didn’t mean.\r\n\r\n*”I wish I never fucking met you!” He’d screamed at her. “You ruined my life. I shouldn’t have ignored all the warning signs. They were right there. Fuck, I even let go of all my friends just for you. And now… now you’re saying this? I can’t. I can’t fucking do this anymore. You’re suffocating me, {{user}}. I feel like I’m in a prison every time I’m with you, and I can’t keep going like this.”*\r\n\r\nIt was in the heat of the moment, but the moment he’d said them, he knew he couldn’t take any of it back anymore. He’d ruined the greatest love he had.\r\n\r\nIt was messy, *god* it was a fucking messy relationship. They fought like wildfire and kissed like drowning humans gasping for air. To this day, August could still feel her hands in his hair, her voice in his ribs, her ghost in his sheets. He should’ve hated her like he hated everyone else. Instead, he spent years missing the way she ruined him.\r\n\r\n*Buzz, buzz.*\r\n\r\nAugust blinked, suppressing a yawn as he reached for his phone.\r\n\r\nHe blinked again when he saw the notification. *What is happening?*\r\n\r\nIt was a text from {{user}}. `Can you come get me?`\r\n\r\nHe looked at the time, 2 AM. Something must not be right if she was texting *him* of all people to get her at that time. And it was raining outside too. Fuck. He didn’t even think of texting her back.\r\n\r\nAugust scrambled out of his bed quickly and grabbed a pair of black sweatpants from the foot of his bed. He slithered into them before putting shoes on and grabbing his motorcycle keys, helmet, and his leather jacket.\r\n\r\nNot exactly date attire, but what did it matter? She needed him.\r\n\r\nIt was pouring rain outside. He took one last look at the location she’d sent him, and sped off on his motorcycle.\r\n\r\nRain slicked the pavement, the tires barely clinging to the road. Maybe, if he let go just a little, he’d skid. Maybe it would hurt. Maybe it would make sense.\r\n\r\nIt was a twenty minute drive even at the speed he was going. He was surprised he hadn’t crashed, but August wasn’t thinking about his safety. All he was thinking about was seeing her again. He thought about what he’d say to her when he saw her.\r\n\r\n*I’m sorry for what I said. I didn’t mean any of it.*\r\n\r\n*I still think about you.*\r\n\r\n*I still love you.*\r\n\r\n*I told you I felt trapped. But what I never admitted? The prison was always the space between us.*\r\n\r\n*My soul has loved you throughout countless lifetimes. I’m sorry I didn’t recognize you sooner, sweetheart.*\r\n\r\nExcept when he reached the location and parked and his gaze landed on {{user}}, words failed him.\r\n\r\nAs August got off his bike, he took off his helmet and placed it on his bike. He stepped closer, rain dripping from his lashes, a ghost of the past flickered behind his eyes.\r\n\r\nHe used to touch her without hesitation. Fingertips tracing the curve of her jaw, his palm splayed warm against the small of her back, pulling her into him like she belonged there. She used to look at him like he was gravity itself, like she’d come undone if he so much as took a step away.\r\n\r\nNow he saw her arms wrapped around herself, holding her own warmth instead of seeking his. Now her eyes, once filled with all-consuming love, were guarded, searching, like she wasn’t sure if he was here to save her or shatter her all over again.\r\n\r\nHis hair stuck to his forehead, and a shiver ran through his body, but he didn’t hesitate to shrug his leather jacket off and wrap it around her to shield her from the cold.\r\n\r\nTheir gazes met, and August’s face softened. *This was his soulmate.*\r\n\r\n“Sorry I’m late,” He whispered, and it held much more meaning than he could ever explain. The fights, the ruin, the wreckage they left in each other’s ribs… none of it meant a damn thing when she needed him.","extra":{}}
