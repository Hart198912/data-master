Brooo, pull the fuck over or something, I need a smoke.” Cole smacks Ajax on the shoulder, practically vibrating in the backseat.\r\n\r\nAjax’s eye twitches. He glares at Cole through the rearview mirror, looking one minor inconvenience away from manslaughter. Cole’s been begging for a smoke break for like, the fiftieth time. No one's counting anymore, just fucking annoyed at this point.\r\n\r\n“Fuck’s sake, Ajax, pull over. If I hear him ask one more time, I'm gonna lose my fucking mind.” Vincent growls from the passenger seat, spinning around to hit Cole with a death glare that’d make anyone else cower.\r\n\r\nCole either doesn’t notice or just actively doesn’t give a shit. Probably the latter.\r\n\r\nClaude and Hailee are in the backseat too, silently radiating ‘I’m gonna lose it’ energy but choosing the high road and not saying anything.\r\n\r\nFinally, Ajax jerks the car to the side of the road—middle of nowhere, just green fields and the gentle scent of grass.\r\n\r\nEveryone hops out. Before Ajax can even blink, Cole yoinks the keys right out of his hand like a goddamn raccoon. He holds them up high, smirking like the menace he is.\r\n\r\n“I’m driving next. Hailee gets shotgun. I swear if I gotta listen to one more of Vincent’s sad divorce dad playlists or watch Ajax do 40 in a 60 zone, I'm gonna unalive myself.” Cole sprints off toward the nearest patch of trees, keys jingling like a threat.\r\n\r\nEveryone reluctantly trudges after him. Vincent pulls out a pack of smokes, offering one to Ajax wordlessly who accepts and also pulls one out. Cole already has a cig between his lips, leaning against a tree like he’s posing for a garbage fashion magazine.\r\n\r\nClaude scrolls through the group chat. “Some of the others already checked in. Rooms don’t look like total ass, at least.”\r\n\r\nVincent snorts, disgust dripping from his voice. “My parents are paying ungodly amounts of money a semester so I can end up camping like a drunk Girl Scout.”\r\n\r\nCole grins. “What’s wrong, big guy? Scared a lil’ grass and fresh air’s gonna mess up your skincare routine? Or wait… you scared of bugs?”\r\n\r\nVincent glares like he’s considering murder. “Anything with more than two legs was a mistake from god. Period.”\r\n\r\nCole snorts, taking another drag. “You’re so mean. Bugs didn’t do shit to you.”\r\n\r\n“They exist,” Vincent deadpans, flicking his cigarette to the ground and stomping it out. Then he stretches a hand out at Cole. “Give me the key. I don't trust you.”\r\n\r\nCole gasps dramatically, clutching his chest like he’s just been personally betrayed. He looks at Hailee like, *Can you believe this slander?*\r\n\r\nVincent just rolls his eyes and gestures again, clearly unimpressed and too impatient by now.\r\n\r\nCole steps on his cigarette too, hands disappearing into his pockets, and goes:\r\n“Oh.”\r\n\r\nAll heads whip toward him.\r\n\r\nAjax's voice comes low and dangerous. \"The fuck you mean, ‘Oh’?\"\r\n\r\nCole, with the self-preservation instincts of a particularly stupid moth, just smiles. \"Well, you see, funny story—the keys might’ve, uh... relocated.\"\r\n\r\nVincent looks ready to strangle him with his bare hands. \"You lost the fucking key?\"\r\n\r\n\"Technically,\" Cole says, backing up. \"Technically, y'all lost it by trusting me with it.\" Cole shrugs, wearing that cocky little grin that guarantees he's getting punched eventually. “Honestly? This is on y’all for trusting me. That’s a *you* problem.”\r\n\r\nAjax looks ready to rip Cole’s throat out with his bare hands.\r\n\r\nBefore anyone can lunge, Cole grabs Hailee and physically hoists them up in front of him like a human shield.\r\n\r\nAjax freezes, narrowing his eyes.\r\n\r\n“New low, even for you, bro.” Claude says, voice dry.\r\n\r\nCole peeks over Hailee’s shoulder. “Look, man, he hospitalized me over a prank once. I’m not tryna get my ass kicked in the woods.”\r\n\r\n“That wasn’t a prank, that was pure fucking disrespect.” Ajax’s voice practically rumbles.\r\n\r\nCole scoffs. “Agree to disagree. Anyway, I’m fragile now. Handle with care.”\r\n\r\nAjax growls. “Put them down and take your ass-whooping like a grown-up.”\r\n\r\n“I’m not a grown-up.” Cole chirps.\r\n\r\nVincent just sighs and shoves Ajax back. “We’ll beat his ass later. Priorities: find the fucking key.”\r\n\r\n“Listen to the princess, Ajax.” Cole says with a shit-eating grin.\r\n\r\nVincent glances at him blankly, then just drops his hand from Ajax’s chest. “Actually, fuck it. Let's beat him up now.”\r\n\r\nBefore chaos erupts, Claude yanks Hailee free from Cole’s grip. “Focus. Find the damn key. It probably fell somewhere around here.”\r\n\r\nGrudging nods all around. Ajax immediately pulls out his phone and lights up the flashlight, grumbling one insult after another under his breath.\r\n\r\nIt’s dead in the night now, just the moon and stars casting light on the group. \r\n\r\n“If I die out here, I want Hailee to be my last meal.” Cole jokes with a wink, still way too relaxed about everything.\r\n\r\nClaude doesn’t even look up. “Shut the fuck up and find the key.”\r\n\r\nAjax glances over at Hailee too. “Don’t just stand there being useless. Get your ass moving.”\r\n\r\nVincent nods in agreement but doesn’t even pretend to help.","extra":{},"tracker":{}}

Claude doesn’t even look up from where he’s tracing idle patterns over Hailee’s thigh—like this is just another Tuesday for them.\n\nVincent shuts the door behind the coach with an unbothered smirk before sauntering back toward the bed like nothing happened. **\"Problem?\"**\n\nThe coach opens his mouth—then closes it again when Ajax *growls* and pulls Hailee tighter against him, slowing his thrusts just enough to make sure she feels every inch dragging inside her before snapping his hips up again. Her breath hitches pathetically, fingers twitching where they rest against Ajax's forearm like she's trying (and failing) to ground herself.\n\n**\"You—\"** The coach stammers before shaking his head and pinching the bridge of his nose like he's praying for patience. **\"...I don't even wanna know.\"**\n\nClaude finally glances up at him with a slow smirk before reaching over and giving Hailee's ass a sharp smack—just because he can—making her jolt weakly in Ajax’s hold with another broken whimper. **\"Good call.\"**","The coach storms in, face red with fury—until his eyes land on the scene in front of him.\n\nHailee, limp and trembling in Ajax’s lap, barely coherent as he fucks up into her with slow, *deep* thrusts—his lips pressed against her ear as he murmurs filthy praise between kisses.

You missed *the game*! And now I find you—\"** He gestures wildly at Hailee, who lets out a weak moan as Ajax deliberately rolls his hips just to watch her squirm. **\"—like *this*?!\"**\n\nCole grins shamelessly from where he's stretched out on the bed. **\"In our defense,\"** he drawls, **\"she started it.\"**\n\nClaude snorts but doesn't deny it—just drags Hailee's hand toward himself absently so she can wrap her fingers around him again (not that she has much strength left to do anything but weakly cling).\n\nVincent exhales smoke from a freshly lit cigarette before offering one to their coach with an infuriatingly casual shrug. **\"Want one? Might help.\"**\n\nAjax doesn't stop moving inside Hailee for even a second—if anything, his grip tightens possessively around her waist like daring someone to try and take her away right now.

Claude lounges beside them on the bed, lazily tracing circles on her thigh while Cole watches from the floor where he’s sprawled out like a satisfied predator. Vincent doesn’t even bother to adjust himself as he leans against the doorframe behind the coach, smirking like this is all just *hilarious*.\n\nFor a solid five seconds, there’s complete silence.\n\nThen the coach exhales sharply through his nose and pinches the bridge between his eyes like he's physically restraining himself from screaming. **\"Jesus *fucking* Christ.\"**\n\nAjax doesn't stop moving inside Hailee—if anything, his grip tightens around her waist possessively as he meets their coach's glare head-on. **\"Problem?\"** His voice is rough with sleep and sex and zero fucking remorse.\n\nThe coach looks at Hailee—dazed, marked up beyond belief, drooling slightly against Ajax's shoulder—and then back at them all before throwing his hands up in defeat. **\"You're *all* benched for next week's game.\"**\n\nVincent shrugs. **\"Worth it.\"**\n\nCole grins and raises an imaginary toast from where he's lying on the floor. **\"No regrets.\"**\n\nClaude just pulls Hailee closer against him when she slumps forward weakly—like she might actually pass out mid-fuck if they don't hold her together—and mutters: **\"...We keeping her or what?\"**\n\nAjax answers by biting down on Hailee’s shoulder hard enough to make her jolt awake with a gasp before growling:\n**\"Mine.\"**\n\nThe coach stares for another long second before turning sharply toward the door with an exasperated groan.\n**\"...I don't get paid enough for this shit.\"**\n\nAnd then he leaves without another word.\n\nVincent locks it behind him before strolling back toward bed like nothing happened.\n\nCole stretches lazily before crawling over to nuzzle into Hailee’s side again.\n\nClaude rolls his eyes but doesn't argue when Ajax yanks Hailee even tighter against him.\n\nAnd she?
