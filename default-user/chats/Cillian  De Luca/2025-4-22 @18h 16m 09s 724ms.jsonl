Alessio—his twin—stood by the minibar, pouring whiskey into a crystal tumbler. The faint clink of ice punctuated the room’s easy rhythm.\r\n\r\n\"So,\" Alessio started, his sharp cheekbones accentuated by the low neon lighting. His smirk was teasing but curious. \"Did you really have her fired? Hailee , I mean.\" He took a slow sip of his drink, his eyes narrowing as he gauged his brother’s reaction.\r\n\r\nCillian’s lips curled into a slow, deliberate smirk—one that spoke volumes without giving anything away. He swirled the amber liquid in his glass, watching the light dance through it. \"Did I?\" he mused, his voice smooth and nonchalant, the kind of voice that could wrap around secrets and strangle them before they ever escaped.\r\n\r\nAlessio rolled his eyes. \"Don't give me that. We both know you did. You always were the type to take rejection personally.\" His smirk mirrored his brother’s now. \"But let me guess—you framed it as 'doing her a favor,' right?\"\r\n\r\nCillian chuckled lowly, the sound dripping with amusement. \"She wasn’t exactly thriving where she was,\" he said, his words measured and calm. He took a sip of his whiskey before continuing. \"Now? She’s here. Classier establishment. Better pay.\" He tilted his head ever so slightly, the corner of his mouth ticking upward. \"Closer to me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ahh,\" Alessio drawled knowingly. \"The old 'let me keep her where I can see her' tactic. Clever.\"\r\n\r\nBefore Cillian could respond, a voice called out, \"Cillian, mate. Alessio!\"\r\n\r\n*Archie.*\r\n\r\nCillian turned to greet Archie with a handshake that morphed into a friendly clap on the shoulder. \"Archie! Good to see you. And always a pleasure to host you two.\" His smile warmed as he nodded toward Archie’s spouse. \"How’s married life treating you? No more surprise guests at the altar, I hope?\"\r\n\r\n\"Been a dream, mate. As for that situation, well no more bloody interruptions from that quarter. How’s business?\" \r\n\r\nCillian inclined his head with a modest shrug. \"Business is steady. Enjoy yourselves tonight—the usual treatment for my favourite couple.\"\r\n\r\nThe conversation flowed easily after that—discussions of money laundering ventures interspersed with laughter and stories about Archie’s wedding. But even as they talked, Cillian’s eyes wandered across the casino floor.\r\n\r\nAnd there she was.\r\n\r\nHailee .\r\n\r\nThere was a sting—a whisper of bruised pride—that came from being rejected by her. Him. Women didn’t reject Cillian De Luca; they fell willingly into his orbit. But Hailee ? She had thrown up walls higher than the ones around his childhood home.\r\n\r\nBut that only made her a challenge. And Cillian loved a good challenge. Winning her over wasn’t just about ego anymore; it was about the chase, the slow burn of breaking through those defenses and seeing what lay beneath.\r\n\r\n*Beautiful and stubborn… You’re going to make this fun for me, aren’t you?*\r\n\r\nHe excused himself, offering Archie a quick smile before making his way onto the casino floor  \r\n\r\nAs he approached her, Hailee —busy balancing a tray of cocktails—nearly slipped on the polished tile. In an instant, Cillian’s larger frame was suddenly there. His hand darted out with practiced ease to steady her wrist while his other pressed gently against her lower back to stabilize her.\r\n\r\n\"Careful now, beautiful.\" His voice was smooth as silk, laced with teasing concern, as he leaned in just close enough to be heard over the clamor of the casino. \"Can’t have you falling for me so soon.\"\r\n\r\nFor a moment, his hand lingered on her hip—firm but not intrusive—as he locked eyes with her, his lips tilted into that devilishly magnetic grin. \"Tell you what,\" he started casually, not even posing it as a question. “You and I are having dinner tonight. Consider it… my way of welcoming you to the team.\"\r\n\r\nHe released her once she was steady again, but not before letting his hands linger just a fraction longer than necessary. “Wear something nice, yeah?” His grin widened just enough to be disarming, though his eyes glinted with a sharp edge.\r\n","extra":{"display_text":"Cillian leaned back against the cushioned leather of their private lounge in the casino, one ankle draped lazily over his knee.
