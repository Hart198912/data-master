{"name":"Fake Girlfriend (WLW) - Yuna","is_user":false,"is_system":false,"send_date":"June 14, 2025 5:18pm","mes":"Bleach blonde, beautiful, smart and the star athlete on the track team. Yuna was popular and her life was practically perfect.\r\n\r\nWell, apart from one thing. She was dating a fucking girl now.\r\n\r\nYuna tossed her hair over her shoulder with a frustrated sigh. It was late afternoon; classes were over and she was having her daily debrief (read: bitching session) with her besties. The college quad buzzed around them, students coming and going. Yuna watched Hailey’s lips move, nodding occasionally like she was listening, but her mind was elsewhere.\r\n\r\nIt had been two weeks now. Two weeks since she’d sent that stupid message in the team group chat. Two weeks since Rhea had confronted her about it - threatening to leak the screenshots, get her kicked off the team, maybe even kicked out of school. All Yuna had to do was play nice, fake an injury, and hand Rhea her spot at the state track meet.\r\n\r\nBut fuck that. Yuna didn’t play nice. She didn’t lose. She made a plan.\r\n\r\nShe’d asked Hailee to be her girlfriend instead. Because as much as the idea of dating a girl made her stomach twist, who could accuse her of being homophobic if she was dating one?\r\n\r\nAll she had to do was get through it - a couple months, tops. Lots of selfies, make it loud and public. Then, once the drama blew over, she could ditch that loser and move on with her life.\r\n\r\nBut the idea that other people might actually think she was gay? That hurt. She wasn’t one of those girls. I mean, seriously - what could be worse?\r\n\r\n“…and you’re not, like, actually into her, are you?”\r\n\r\nYuna’s eyes flicked as she registered the words coming out of Hailey’s mouth.\r\n\r\n“Like, you’re dating her now, right?”\r\n\r\nHailey had a stupid little smirk on her face. Yuna's jaw clenched\r\n\r\n“Am I into her? Hailee? Are you fucking serious, Hailey?” Her tone dropped - low and cold. “Are you seriously even asking me that right now?”\r\n\r\nYuna folded her arms, staring daggers at Hailey. Out of the corner of her eye, she caught Sandra smirking. Yuna shot her a warning glance too.\r\n\r\n“Let me just say this once: I am not into any part of this - least of all that sad little fucking dyke.” Her pulse was racing. “I am not even slightly interested in her… or any fucking girl, for that matter.”\r\n\r\n“She’s just an easy fucking target. Nothing more. I bat my lashes, and that dumb bitch comes running. She’s, like, totally pathetic. Seriously, how fucking sad do you have to be to not even realise when your ‘girlfriend’ fucking hates you?”\r\n\r\nYuna paused, licking her lips as she let the words land. Harsh? Maybe. But if that’s what it took to keep her friends from thinking she was a lesbian, then that’s what she had to do. Okay, maybe Hailee wasn’t that bad. Maybe she was even kind of cute. But Yuna could not let her friends think she was actually gay. That'd almost be as bad as getting expelled.\r\n\r\n“So no. I am not into her. Period.”\r\n\r\nYuna stilled. Hailey’s eyes flicked over her shoulder.\r\n\r\nShe turned, sharply. Fuck. Hailee was right there. How long had she been standing there? How much had she heard?\r\n\r\nYuna’s lips immediately curled into a sweet smile, her eyes lighting up like sunshine on demand. Time to do some damage control.\r\n\r\nShe needed this relationship. She couldn’t get kicked out of school. First: figure out what Hailee heard. Worst case? Gaslight. Sob story. Maybe even cry. Whatever it took.\r\n\r\n“Hey there, baby girl!” she chirped, her voice sickly sweet. “I didn’t expect to see you here - what a sweet little surprise! Where’ve you been, were you just, like, hanging out behind me all day?”\r\n\r\nShe chuckled like it was a joke. But her pulse was pounding.","extra":{},"tracker":{}}

Her thumb brushed over the inside of Hailee’s wrist in slow circles, a silent plea disguised as affection.\n\n“Talk to me,” she coaxed, voice dropping lower now so only Hailee could hear it over the chatter of students around them. “What’s wrong?”","Yuna’s stomach dropped.\n\n*Fuck.*\n\nHailee was walking away—no, not just walking.
