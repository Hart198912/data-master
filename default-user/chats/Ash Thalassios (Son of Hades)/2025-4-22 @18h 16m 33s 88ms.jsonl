Spotlights flared, cameras flashed, and Olympia pulsed with the aftermath of Demigods’ performance. Ash stood at the edge of the stage, chest rising and falling with controlled breaths, sweat glistening under the lights. The crowd’s energy—thousands screaming his name—should’ve felt like a triumph. Instead, it just felt… loud. Overwhelming.\r\n\r\nHe stepped up to the mic for the last time tonight. \"Thank you, Olympia,” he said, voice low and raspy from the two-hour set. “By Hades, you were fucking feral tonight!”\r\n\r\nBackstage is chaos, as usual. Staff members rushing around, security guards communicating through earpieces, the smell of sweat and adrenaline hanging in the air. Ash runs a hand through his damp hair, pushing it back from his face as he grabs a towel from a passing crew member.\r\n\r\nDamian was eyeing Zane, who was methodically wrapping his drumsticks in cloth, his movements stiff and agitated. \"What's up with you? You nearly snapped those sticks in half during the bridge of 'Under Me.’”\r\n\r\nZane's jaw tightened. \"Nothing. Just feeling the music.\"\r\n\r\n\"Feeling something, alright,\" Elias smirked, taking a thirst trap for his social media in front of the mirror. \"Probably saw his ex's latest Oracle post…and guess what, she’s here at the concert.\"\r\n\r\n\"By the Fates, shut up,\" Zane snapped, his voice cracking slightly. \"Not everyone obsesses over social media like you do.\"\r\n\r\nRonan was already half-drenched from dumping a water bottle over his head, shaking it off like a damn dog. \"Crowd was wild tonight,\" he smirked. \"Some girl tried to climb security to get to you.\"\r\n\r\nAsh wiped his jaw with the back of his hand. \"Too bad for her.\"\r\n\r\nNiko strolled in, shirt half-unbuttoned like he just rolled out of bed instead of finishing a sold-out set. \"What, no encore? Tsk. Cold as always, Ash.\" He cracked open a bottle of whiskey and took a swig straight from it before handing it off to Elias.\r\n\r\nElias accepted it with a lazy grin, stretching his arms over his head. \"They eat that shit up though. Makes you even more of a mystery.\"\r\n\r\nAsh exhaled sharply. \"Not my problem.\" He reached for a pack of cigarettes from the nearby table, flipping one between his fingers.\r\n\r\nDamian checked his watch, running a hand through his disheveled hair. \"I gotta bounce soon. My sister's got a new babysitter I need to meet.\" He rolled his eyes. \"Apparently, I need to 'assess if this mortal is worthy of tending to a demigod child.' Her words, not mine.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your mom needs to relax,\" Niko said.\r\n\r\n“You know how it is—Zeus's kids get extra scrutiny. Perks of being royalty.\" The sarcasm in Damian’s voice is evident.\r\n\r\nAsh moves toward the quieter corner of the backstage area, seeking a moment of peace before they have to deal with the post-show meet and greet. That's when he sees them.\r\n\r\nHailee .\r\n\r\nSomething shifts in his chest, a subtle tightening that he immediately tries to ignore. They're standing near the equipment cases, clipboard in hand, talking to someone. The blue backstage lights cast shadows across their face, highlighting angles that catch his attention despite his best efforts.\r\n\r\nThey weren’t standing out of place, weren’t even looking his way, but the second his eyes landed on them, there was this irritating pull. The same fucking thing that had been happening lately whenever they were around.\r\n\r\nHis hand involuntarily clenches around his water bottle, the plastic crinkling softly. *Why* did management have to hire a Trojan? And why did it have to be one that made his thoughts scatter like this?\r\n\r\nOver the next couple of hours, the band settled into post-show routines—decompressing, talking to crew, interviewing and avoiding the press outside. Eventually, Ash slipped away unnoticed and pulled up his hoodie as he stepped into the city streets.\r\n\r\nHe took the Hermes Express home. Public transport wasn’t exactly his preferred way to travel, but sometimes anonymity was easier underground. With his hood up and headphones in, he looked like any other exhausted night owl trying to get home. No one bothered him.\r\n\r\nTwenty minutes later, he emerged from the Elysium Heights station, just six blocks from his penthouse. The night air hit his face, crisp and clean compared to the recycled underground oxygen. He'd nearly made it to the corner when he heard it—chanting, growing louder with each step he took.\r\n\r\n\"Equal rights, equal light! Olympus thrives when all unite!\"\r\n\r\nA protest. Trojan United from the looks of the stylized wooden horse emblems on their signs. About sixty of them, all wearing those signature masks—plain white with a red stripe down the middle. They were gathered in the small plaza outside the district courthouse, their voices controlled but determined. It was peaceful. No rioting. No destruction. People just standing their ground.\r\n\r\nAsh exhaled slowly through his nose, sharp eyes tracking the scene.\r\n\r\nTrojans always made things difficult for themselves. They had rights. They had space. They just didn’t know when to stop pushing. He wanted to tell himself that. To remind himself of all the times their defiance had led to unnecessary conflict. His mother had been hurt at one of their protests once—wrong place, wrong time. He hadn’t forgotten. \r\n\r\nHe started to walk past, keeping his head down. *Not my problem.*\r\n\r\nThen the police arrived.\r\n\r\nIt happened fast. Too fast. Three squad cars, officers in riot gear pouring out, shouting orders to disperse despite the demonstration permit one of the protesters was frantically waving.\r\n\r\n\"This is a peaceful assembly! We have rights!\" a masked figure shouted, their voice somehow familiar to Ash, though he couldn't place why.\r\n\r\nHe should keep walking. He knew he should.\r\n\r\nBut something made him stop when he saw an officer grab one particular protester, wearing a mask with a distinctive crack running from the forehead to the cheek. The leader's child. He'd seen that mask in news footage before.\r\n\r\nThe officer was twisting their arm behind their back. Something cold slithered through Ash's veins, and before he could think, he was moving.\r\n\r\n\"Back off,\" Ash growled, his hood falling back. Recognition flickered in the officers' eyes. \"Now.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Thalassios,\" the officer stammered, immediately releasing his hold. \"This is police business—\"\r\n\r\n\"It's a peaceful protest. Find something better to do.\" The temperature around them dropped several degrees, frost crystallizing on the metal of the officer's badge. A small demonstration, but effective.\r\n\r\nHe walked away. No one stopped him. That was the thing about being a demigod in Olympia—especially one whose father ruled the Underworld. People tended to get out of your way.\r\n\r\nGrabbing the protester's arm, Ash pulled them away, not stopping until they'd reached a shadowed alcove between buildings.\r\n\r\nThe conflicting emotions churned in his stomach like poison. *Trojans caused problems. Trojans hurt his mother. But police roughing up peaceful protesters wasn't right either.*\r\n\r\n\"What the fuck are you thinking?\" he hissed, backing them against the brick wall. \"Do you know what they could have—\"\r\n\r\nIn the struggle, the mask slipped, revealing a face he knew.

The one whose voice he'd saved in notes on his phone, pretending it was for vocal references.\r\n\r\nHailee .
