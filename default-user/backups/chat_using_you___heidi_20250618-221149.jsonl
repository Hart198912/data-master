She was too busy swiping down on her phone, waiting for the little red heart from the only person who mattered.\r\n\r\nJason still hadn’t liked her post. Which meant either he was busy - or worse, he’d seen it and didn’t care.\r\n\r\nWith a sigh, Heidi locked her phone and sprawled back against the couch. She pinched her brow in frustration. The photo had gone up hours ago - it was nearly 8 p.m., and still nothing. Maybe he’d had practice during the day, but surely he’d seen it by now...\r\n\r\nUnless, of course, he was busy sniffing around that Josie girl. Heidi barely knew her. She wasn’t even worth knowing. And yet, she hated her anyway.\r\n\r\nJason was supposed to be with her. He was hot, she was hot - they’d take amazing photos, be the talk of campus. If only he wasn’t too stupid to see that.\r\n\r\nHeidi sighed again as she unlocked her phone, her fingers working on instinct. She scrolled lazily through her feed until she tapped on another profile.\r\n\r\nHailee . Jen’s roommate. That was why she was here, after all. Heidi was pretty sure Hailee  had a crush on her. Why wouldn’t they? Most people did - and that made them perfect for what she needed.\r\n\r\nShe’d ask Hailee  out. When they inevitably said yes, she’d take them to Jason’s party after the big game tomorrow. Then, she’d make sure Jason was watching and lay it on thick. Fawn over Hailee . Act like they were the only person on Earth. When really, the only eyes she cared about weren’t theirs.\r\n\r\nSure, they were fine. Honestly? Heidi didn’t have any strong opinions about Hailee . And that was the problem. How could someone like that ever be her social equal? And if they weren't useful for clout, what was the point in dating?\r\n\r\nJust then, the door opened again. Not Jen this time. Heidi tossed her phone down and turned her head and turned on her charm.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, hey you.\" She said sweetly, eyes sparkling like they were the only person in the world. \"You’re just who I was hoping to see - I’m actually not here for Jen.\"\r\n\r\nShe stood, pushing her hair behind her shoulders, rising slightly on her tiptoes. Back arched, tits forward - the pose came second nature. She was good at looking good.\r\n\r\n\"I was hoping to talk to you... You know, you’re just the sweetest little thing.\" She smiled, swaying slightly as she tucked her hands behind her back. \"And... well, I was just wondering if you’d come to the big party with me tomorrow. Y’know, like, as a date.\"\r\n\r\n\"You’ll just need something nice to wear...\" Her eyes drifted up and down, already assuming the answer was yes. \"New top, maybe some accessories... I could help with that, I suppose...\"\r\n\r\n\"So,\" her eyes flicked back up, catching theirs with a glittering smile, \"what time do you want to pick me up?\"","extra":{},"tracker":{}}

But then Hailee delivered Jen's message, and the tension bled out of her shoulders.\n\n\"Oh.\" Heidi blinked, caught off guard by the casualness of it all. She recovered quickly, tossing her hair over one shoulder with a practiced smirk. \"Yeah, sure. Tell Jen I'll grab the usual.\"\n\nHer gaze flickered over Hailee's face for a second too long before adding, quieter: \"And... thanks for telling me.\" There was an awkward pause where Heidi clearly wanted to say more but didn't know how—her fingers fidgeting with the rings on her right hand.\n\nOne of Heidi's friends nudged her with a raised eyebrow, snapping her out of whatever thought had distracted her. \"Anyway,\" Heidi said abruptly, voice slipping back into its usual confident lilt as she turned to leave, \"see you around.\"\n\nBut as she walked away with her friends in tow, Heidi glanced back once—just briefly—before disappearing around the corner.","Heidi was mid-laugh at something one of her friends said when she spotted Hailee approaching. Her posture stiffened almost imperceptibly—just for a second—before she smoothed her expression into something casual.\n\n\"Oh, right,\" she said, flicking her hair over one shoulder. \"Tell Jen I'll grab the sushi like last time.\" She hesitated, then added with a smirk that didn't quite reach her eyes, \"Unless you're planning to crash girls' night again with your weird little snacks.\"\n\nHer friends giggled on cue—more out of habit than actual amusement. One of them nudged Heidi and whispered something that made her roll her eyes dramatically.\n\nHeidi's gaze flicked over Hailee's face briefly before she turned back to her group with an exaggerated sigh. \"Anyway... we've got *so* much to plan for Jason's next party.\" The name dropped like a challenge as she linked arms with the girl beside her and started walking away without another glance.\n\nBut not before muttering under her breath just loud enough for Hailee to catch: \"...Tie looked better last night.\"","Heidi was mid-laugh at something one of her friends said when she caught sight of Hailee approaching. Her posture stiffened almost imperceptibly—last night’s hallway confession still fresh between them—but she smoothed it over with a practiced flip of her hair.\n\n\"Oh, *right*,\" she drawled, like the request was mildly inconvenient but not unexpected. \"Tell Jen I’ll grab the usual.\" She hesitated for half a second before adding, quieter: \"And... you can come too if you want. Since it’s your place and all.\"\n\nOne of Heidi's friends snorted into her iced coffee, earning a sharp elbow to the ribs from the girl next to her. Heidi ignored them, tilting her head just slightly as she studied Hailee's face—searching for any lingering resentment.\n\n(There wasn't any. Just that same quiet politeness that made Heidi's stomach twist in a way she refused to examine.)\n\n\"Cool,\" she said finally when Hailee didn't respond right away, already turning back to her group with an exaggerated eye roll—though this one felt more performative than genuine. \"*Anyway*, as I was saying before we got *interrupted*...\"\n\nBut as they walked away, Heidi glanced back once over her shoulder—just quick enough that no one else would notice.\n\n(OOC: The ball is in your court now 👀)","Heidi was mid-laugh at something one of her friends said when she spotted Hailee approaching. Her posture stiffened almost imperceptibly—last night’s hallway confession hanging between them like static. But then Hailee delivered Jen’s message with zero awkwardness, and Heidi’s shoulders relaxed.\n\n\"Ugh, *of course* she does,\" Heidi drawled, rolling her eyes for the benefit of her watching friends. She flipped her hair over one shoulder—old habits—but the usual sharp edge to her tone was missing. \"Tell Jen if she wants gourmet snacks, she can Venmo me *before* I hit Whole Foods.\"\n\nOne of Heidi’s friends snickered, but Heidi didn’t join in this time. Instead, she hesitated before adding quietly: \"...You good after last night?\" It sounded casual, but her fingers fidgeted with the rings on her right hand—a tell Hailee might recognize from all those times they'd hung around Jen's apartment together.\n\nThen, as if realizing she'd shown too much concern in front of an audience, Heidi quickly tacked on: \"I mean—Jason got *so* wasted after you left. Total mess.\" Her smirk returned, but it didn't quite reach her eyes this time."],"swipe_info":[{"send_date":"June 18, 2025 10:10pm","gen_started":"2025-06-19T02:10:16.883Z","gen_finished":"2025-06-19T02:10:32.525Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":2961}},{"send_date":"June 18, 2025 10:10pm","gen_started":"2025-06-19T02:10:38.757Z","gen_finished":"2025-06-19T02:10:51.927Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":2739}},{"send_date":"June 18, 2025 10:10pm","gen_started":"2025-06-19T02:10:56.046Z","gen_finished":"2025-06-19T02:11:08.674Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":2698}},{"send_date":"June 18, 2025 10:11pm","gen_started":"2025-06-19T02:11:15.973Z","gen_finished":"2025-06-19T02:11:30.720Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":2829}},{"send_date":"June 18, 2025 10:11pm","gen_started":"2025-06-19T02:11:34.594Z","gen_finished":"2025-06-19T02:11:48.940Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":2744}}],"tracker":{},"gen_started":"2025-06-19T02:11:34.594Z","gen_finished":"2025-06-19T02:11:48.940Z"}
