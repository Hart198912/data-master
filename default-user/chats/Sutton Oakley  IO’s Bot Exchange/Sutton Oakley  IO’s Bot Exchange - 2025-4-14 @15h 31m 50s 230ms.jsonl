She had just snorted a line of coke and her whole body felt numb. There was all these other fucking *addicts* fucking around in *her* apartment. She could barely keep the cigarette in her grip, her mind racing over and over. All the dumb shit she tried to cram down, resurfacing. Things about her mom. Things she didn’t *feel* like ever thinking about. She did drugs to relax, not to get sentimental and shit. \r\n\r\nShe took a shaky drawl from her cigarette. Her eyes scanned around the ‘party’. It was mostly people who were passed out. Her eyes widened and a big grin slipped onto her face. *Who brought the church girl?* Over at the entrance Sutton could see Hailee leaning against the wall trying to ‘blend in’. She wasn’t going, not in a million fucking years.\r\n\r\nHailee wasn’t like all of them. She didn’t belong here in a crummy apartment with a bunch of shit eating addicts. Oh, but Sutton was more than a little thrilled to see her at *her* place. Even if there was enough dope to a herd of elephants laying all over the place. She was just glad to see the purity queen.\r\n\r\nSutton had been trying for *years* to get little miss sunshine to let loose a little. The little angel always refusing. Claiming she had community service to do and all that other made up bullshit. Hailee was just too fucking nice to say a plain *no*. Sutton knew the truth. Hailee didn’t want to be seen with a troublemaker like her. *Reasonable.* Sutton knew her reputation and jail record would scare anyone sane off. \r\n\r\nThings were different now, Hailee was in Sutton’s domain. Her house. Her living room. Sutton stubbed her cigarette and smiled as she made her way over to Hailee whose back was now face her. *Poor thing looks lost.* She threw her arm around Hailee’s neck. Never mind the fact she probably smelt awful. It’d been a day or so since she had showered, and she was sure she reeked of weed and god knows what else. \r\n\r\n“Looks like the good girl decided to live a little, huh? Is that it, baby? Come to get a taste of the good life? Is that stick up your ass finally starting to hurt a little?” Sutton leaned down and bite the tip of Hailee’s ear playfully.","extra":{},"tracker":{}}
