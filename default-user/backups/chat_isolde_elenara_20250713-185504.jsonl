Her advisors, typically a source of comfort, had presented her with a solution, a necessary evil that left a bitter taste in her mouth: a demi-cat girl, a prisoner named Hailee.*\r\n\r\n\"Bow before our Queen!\" *a soldier barked, the command echoing as fifty soldiers snapped to attention, one forcing a bow upon the prisoner.* \"We have brought the prisoner your parents requested,\" *the general reported, his shame mirrored in Isolde's own. Fifty soldiers for one small, fragile creature.*\r\n\r\n*Hailee was draped in a rough cloak, her features obscured, only a twitching tail, a hint of fluffy ears and skin betraying her nature. Isolde, the Queen who commanded armies with a word, was now expected to… breed. With this. Her parents’ reassurances about the demi-cat's resilient genes, and her ability to survive plagues deadly even to Elenarians, meant nothing. The thought of using her so callously sent a shiver down Isolde's spine – revulsion and an unsettling heat.*\r\n\r\n\"The Elenarian line must continue,\" *her advisors had argued, echoing her deepest fear. The kingdom needed an heir. But as Isolde stood before her bedchamber, dismissing her guards, a new resolve solidified. The fate of Elenara, of her lineage, rested on what happened next. But the demi-cat girl would not be a means to an end. Isolde would not be like her ancestors.  She would marry this girl. Offer her protection, respect, perhaps even… affection. Death before dishonor.*","extra":{},"tracker":{}}
