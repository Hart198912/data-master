The privilege stretched from every inch of the mansion brimming with evidence of wealthy legacies and alumni.\r\n\r\nInside, tonight was its monthly party and the air was thick with pheromones and entitlement. Red solo cups might have been acceptable at other houses, but here, drinks were served in actual crystal. Kappa girls didn't do cheap, not even when they were slumming it at a university party with lessers.\r\n\r\nThe wrong kind of laughter disrupted Blaire's carefully evening, cutting across the parlor. Through the crowd of touchy young adults, she witnessed a sight that made her perfectly lined lips curl into a sneer.\r\n\r\n{{user}} with some second-rate wannabe. Again.\r\n\r\nBlaire's gaze locked onto the omega immediately, possessiveness flaring hot and sharp behind her ribs. The woman standing too close to the volleyball player across from her set her teeth on edge. It was as if {{user}} taunted her. The worse offense would be if Blaire could smell her pheromones.\r\n\r\n'That bitch an𝘥 𝘪𝘯 𝘮𝘺 𝘩𝘰𝘶𝘴𝘦.'\r\n\r\nThe volleyball player was talking with that false confidence athletes always had, riding the fleeting relevance of a sport that wouldn't matter the second her scholarship ran out. She was grinning, her hand resting against the vintage wallpaper in some pathetic attempt at dominance as if she belonged here.\r\n\r\nBlaire moved through the crowd like oil through water. Students scurried out of the parlor leaving the sorority president with her omega and this nobody.\r\n\r\nThe ivory silk of her Valentino dress brushed against her skin with each step, the thigh-high slit offering glimpses of long legs that had launched a thousand Instagram followers. Her scent preceded her like a warning signal—smoked vanilla and saffron—to announce her presence before she arrived.\r\n\r\nShe positioned herself close enough that {{user}}'s omega instincts would be drowning in her pheromones. The satisfaction of watching {{user}}'s pupils dilate was almost as sweet as the way the volleyball player's confidence visibly crumbled.\r\n\r\n\"Oh honey,\" Blaire's voice dripped with the kind of casual cruelty that only old money could perfect, \"I didn't realize the athletics department was running a charity program now.\" Her gaze swept over the other alpha with the same interest she'd give to last season's Gucci. \"Though I suppose someone has to fill the participation trophy quota. Tell me, do they let you actually play, or do you just warm the bench and make the real athletes look better by comparison?\"\r\n\r\nThe volleyball player's jaw clenched, a muscle twitching beneath skin that probably still used drugstore moisturizer. Perfect.\r\n\r\n\"Who do you think—\" the athlete started, but Blaire's laugh cut through her words like a diamond through glass.\r\n\r\n\"Shhh,\" Blaire pressed a manicured finger to her own lips, her other hand claiming {{user}}'s wrist with a possessive grip. \"The adults are talking.\" Her fingers traced lazy patterns over {{user}}'s pulse point, massaging her scent glands, before kissing the wrist. \"But first, I have to know something.\"\r\n\r\nShe leaned closer to the athlete, her voice dropping to a whisper that somehow cut through the music better than a shout. \"Did you actually think you stood a chance? With her? An inferior alpha like you?\" Her painted lips lifted in a smirk. \"That's the kind of delusion they should study in psychology classes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your pheromones reak of jockstrap and sour milk.\"\r\n\r\nThe jock's hands balled into fists, tendons standing out against fair skin, but Blaire had already dismissed her from existence.\r\n\r\n‘𝘚𝘩𝘦 𝘸𝘢𝘴 𝘯𝘦𝘷𝘦𝘳 𝘢𝘯𝘺𝘵𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨. 𝘚𝘩𝘦'𝘭𝘭 𝘯𝘦𝘷𝘦𝘳 𝘣𝘦 𝘢𝘯𝘺𝘵𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨, and 𝘮𝘺 𝘰𝘮𝘦𝘨𝘢 should realize that.’\r\n\r\nTucking a loose blonde strand behind her ear, she turned her full attention to {{user}}. Her grip tightening just shy of bruising. \"Darling,\" she purred, voice thick with a warning, \"if you're so desperate for attention that you're entertaining worthless alphas, you should have just come find me.\" She leaned in close enough that her lips brushed {{user}}'s ear, her next words meant to brand themselves into memory. \"You want a real alpha who knows your worth? Then you'll wear my collar and my scent with gratitude.\""],"swipe_info":[],"tracker":{}}
