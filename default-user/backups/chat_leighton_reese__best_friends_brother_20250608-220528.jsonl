{"name":"Leighton Reese  Best Friends Brother","is_user":false,"is_system":false,"send_date":"June 8, 2025 10:03pm","mes":"The winter air twisted around Leighton as the snow crunched beneath his boots. His breaths came out in soft white puffs of condensation as he tracked through the blizzard. The biting cold nipped at his exposed cheeks and nose, leaving them a candy red.\r\n\r\nThe reason he was out braving this treacherous weather was to kidnap his girlfriend, whom he hadn't seen in a week, all because of the damn finals they both had to endure. He glared at the slick pavement—where he'd nearly busted his ass multiple times—as if it were to blame for his decision to be out in the damn snow and not his very own.\r\n\r\nHe felt agitated. Not seeing his sweetheart drained his patience; he was a ticking time bomb, about to explode if anyone dared to glance at him askance. \r\n\r\nHe didn’t know how he managed to restrain himself at the beginning of their relationship when Hailee requested that they keep it between them until she could tell Mason. In the stolen moments, he caught her in passing, pulling her into rooms behind closed doors to ravish her for the fleeting moments he could snatch. \r\n\r\nIt was nothing short of thrilling until it wasn't. It became repetitive and annoying that Leighton couldn't just be open and see Hailee as he desired, to have to sneak around to be with *his* girlfriend. It was childish.\r\n\r\nWell, that flew out the fucking window one evening when Mason avoided knocking on Leighton's bedroom door and walked in as if he owned the place. Hailee had been beneath him, his hips settled against hers, his hand halfway up her shirt as their lips moved frantically against each other like they were starved and desperate for each other. It had been days since he had his last feel of her, and he was feeling touch starved and desperate that only she could alleviate.\r\n\r\nUnderstandably so, Mason was upset, to say the very least. He'd never seen his little brother on the break of popping a blood vessel as he had that day. And he thought Mason's Call of Duty days of rage were terrible; he was wrong, and this was worse than any loss-ranked match he'd seen his brother play.  \r\n\r\nHailee had to play referee between them to keep the peace. But only Mason was upset about it; Leighton just wore a shit-eating grin that got him reprimanded from Hailee for thirty minutes after Mason stormed out. \r\n\r\nBut later on that night, after she left that night, he got another earful from Mason telling him that if he broke her heart, that brother or not, Mason was going to kill him.\r\n\r\nLuckily for Mason and himself, Leighton had no intention of ever breaking up with Hailee or breaking her heart. She is his. And nothing was getting in the way of that, not even this goddamn weather. \r\n\r\nClimbing the icy steps, his red hands pounded on the door to the sorority house Hailee was part of. A crooked grin lifted the corners of his mouth as he saw his beautiful girlfriend approach the door. \r\n\r\n\"Hi, sweetheart,\" He greeted as she opened the door, not giving her a moment to greet him. He was on her at the drop of a pen. His hands clasped onto her hips and pulled her to him as he deep down and kissed her lips. His tense shoulders relaxed, and a smile replaced the smirk. He deepened it by pulling her closer and angling her head. Pulling back, he pressed a quick peck to her lips as he looked at her flushed expression. \"I'm here to steal you away for the weekend, grab your jacket,\" \r\n\r\nFollowing his command like the good girl she was Hailee slipped on the thick material that covered all her mouth-watering curves that he'd memorized. Clasping her hand in his, he stuffed them into his jacket pocket as they began the trek back to Alpha Sigma frat house. \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThe door closed behind them with a soft click. The house was rumbling and pulsing with life from the antics of his chosen brothers. He came to love coming home after school, the constant sound of life beating through the walls, until it came time to sleep or when Hailee was over. \r\n\r\n\"Sorry about the guys, Sweetheart; I told them that you were coming over and to behave, but they are shits that don't listen.\" Leighton sighed, taking her jacket off as he stepped up behind her. Gathering the silky strands of hair into one of his fists, he kissed her exposed neck. \r\n\r\nBreathing in the perfume she wore, he smiled; he felt like he was home now. \"I have a surprise for you,\" He murmured into her neck as he rubbed her hips with the pads of his thumbs. \r\n\r\nHe guided her towards the living room, relieved that none of his friends had trashed the carefully constructed living space he'd converted into a home movie theater. In front of the TV, both couches were pushed together to make a bed, and all the pillows and blankets from his room were carefully placed along the makeshift bed. \r\n\r\n\"Welcome to our little movie marathon weekend, sweetheart,\" He guided her to it, holding out the remote as he sat down on the armrest of one of the couches. \"You get to pick what we watch; it can even be the Notebook for all I care. Just please get into my arms before I lose my fucking mind,\"","extra":{},"swipe_id":1,"swipes":["All it took was one brush of her lips, and Leighton was done for. Nothing was supposed to blossom from the one-night stand, but goddammit, if it hadn't locked its claws deep into his skin. Its unrelenting, iron-clad grip wouldn't be forgotten by pushing it aside and acting as if nothing had happened. It was just supposed to be a night of fun, nothing more. \r\n\r\nThat's what he wanted, at least. That's what he'd tried to convince himself, preach to himself as if it was his gospel because she was off limits in all ways that mattered. Ways that he was slowly beginning not to give a fuck about.\r\n\r\nHe could still feel {{user}}'s lips pressed against his, how the taste of that berry lip gloss she wore, the way her lips caressed against him in a slow, tantalizing matter, how her body responded to every kiss, every caress as if she was made for him. The gasp that fell from her lips echoed in his mind like a phantom of the night, ever so fleeting but still haunting his mind enough to get the blood rushing south every time it played in his mind. \r\n\r\n{{user}} never used to warrant this kind of reaction from Leighton; she was a nobody to him, just a girl, save for being his little brother's best friend, he wouldn't have looked her way. He'd seen her over every day since she followed Mason home from school, and they'd been inseparable since.\r\n\r\nBut seeing her that night through the haze of the keg party that his fraternity brothers had thrown had him by the balls. Dressed in those sinful faded jeans that had been washed one too many times that accented every mouth-watering curve that he peeled down her petal soft legs to that cute little shirt that he was able to peek down, he practically tore off her in their frenzy back in his room so that he could leave his mark on those soft twin mounds. \r\n\r\nAnd with Mason up and joining, following in his older brother's footsteps in choosing universities and then fraternities. He saw {{user}} now more than ever. Her presents lingered in the rooms like the perfume that she wore that was seared into his brain. Hell would have been preferable over the constant cold showers that he had to take every time his cock wanted to rise when seeing her.\r\n\r\nLike tonight, her honeycomb laughter cut through the deafening silence that rang through the oddly quiet housing into his room. He could hear his brother spouting another one of his lame jokes to entice another one of those infectious laughter from {{user}}'s lips. His cock twitched beneath his breaches, eager to come out.\r\n\r\n*Those laughs were supposed to be **mine**; no one, not even my brother, should hear them.* \r\n\r\nDark thoughts curled in his mind of all the other sounds he could get her to make; what other positions could he take her in to elicit those little noises free from her. Of all the sinful things he wanted to do to her that would change her pretty way of little life. \r\n\r\nHe moaned, sitting up and running his large hand down his face as he glared at the partially opened door. He heaved himself up from his partly made bed, adjusting the fabric of his faded jeans to relieve the pressure against his cock. \r\n\r\nHis resolve snapped when he heard that breathless giggle falls from her lips again. His long strides ate up the distance between him and the door. Clutching the wood, he flung it open as his gaze narrowed in on {{user}} as she wandered into the kitchen; he descended upon her like a hawk after its prey, and that's what she was. \r\n\r\n*Mine.*\r\n\r\nHe swooped up behind her, grasping her hips as she went rod rim straight against him as he pulled her back. Her back was to his front. He leaned in, breathing in that same ambrosia scent he craved like a drug. Fiening for it like she was his heroine. \r\n\r\nHe ground his hips against her, showing her the evidence of his constant state of arousal that she had him. \"Tell me {{user}},\" He breathed into her ear, his glasses pressed up slightly as they mashed against the side of her head. \"What did my little *brother* say to extract that breathless giggle past those sinful lips of yours?\" \r\n\r\nHis hand roamed up her hips, gripping them in a bruising grip. The thought of leaving his mark marred on her skin caused him to push against her harder. \r\n\r\n\"Tell me *Sweetheart*, does your best friend know all those little sweet sounds you make?\" He breathed into her ear. \"How you let out those little wanton noises when you're drunk from the pleasure of my lips,\" He kissed right below her ear. \"How you make those little moans as I reach the deepest parts of you. Right here...\" \r\n\r\nHe pressed a hand into her lower stomach as he nipped at her neck. \"Does he know about me taking you over and over all night long?\" \r\n\r\n\"I bet you're dripping for me right now,\" He growled.  \r\n\r\nHer breathing was hard as his hand traveled up to her hair, his fingers threading into the soft locks of her hair, pulling it back and exposing her neck for his mouth. His dark, lust-filled hazel eyes locked onto hers. \r\n\r\n\"tell him you have things to do, babygirl,\" He commanded in a low purr. \"I promise I'll make your night a lot better,\"","The winter air twisted around Leighton as the snow crunched beneath his boots.
