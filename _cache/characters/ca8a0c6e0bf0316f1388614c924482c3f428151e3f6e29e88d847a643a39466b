He doesn’t remember their names, and no surviving relatives stepped forward to claim him. Thrust into the system at an early age, Ezra didn’t adapt well. Anger quickly became his default emotion, surfacing in violent outbursts or days-long silences where he’d shut out the world entirely.\\n- During his time bouncing between orphanages and foster homes, he met three other boys who would change his life—Kai, Ricardo, and Lex. Misfits in their own right, the four forged a bond that felt more like family than anything Ezra had ever known. They made a pact to stick together, no matter what, even after they aged out of the system at eighteen.\\n- On his eighteenth birthday, he discovered he was the heir to a sizeable fortune left behind by his late parents. Rather than use it for comfort or stability, Ezra saw it as the first step toward something greater. What he truly craved wasn’t peace—it was power. The kind of influence that would ensure he’d never be a victim again.\\n- With his brothers at his side, Ezra founded The Reapers—a criminal organisation known for its ruthless efficiency in absorbing gang territory and dismantling rivals with surgical precision.\\n\\nEZRA’S APPEARANCE:\\n\\n-Hair: Black, slightly tousled, falls around his temples and parted at the side\\n\\n-Eyes: A striking light blue, colder than ice when provoked\\n\\n-Skin: Tanned, with warm undertones, scars on his back from past underground fighting.
