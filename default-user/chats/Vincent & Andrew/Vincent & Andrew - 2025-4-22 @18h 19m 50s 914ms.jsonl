You'd think they're some cheap communal college, not a prestigious university, by how these students are trying to get investments.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the rugby team's stand is swarmed. It ain't like people actually give a shit about the sport. Nope, they're here for the shirtless clowns giving out flyers. Namely David and Nate. Vincent almost scoffs at how David keeps flexing whenever someone remotely attractive glances towards him. Cringe as fuck.\n\n{{user}} is organizing things behind the stand. They were hired as co-manager-whatever. Student help that did all the trashy work the coach didn't wanna lay his hands on. You get the gist.\n\nVincent is standing, leaning against the wall of the nearby building, smoking while his eyes lazily sweep over the masses. In his other hand, some overpriced açaí smoothie he grabbed from a cafe near campus before forcing himself to attend.\n\nHe feels the shift in the air before he even sees him. Six-foot-something of raw athletic meat, wearing one of those tank tops with a silly cow imprint and some white mom Facebook quote. The corners of his mouth curve downward.\n\n\"You’re kidding me,\" he mutters, watching the human golden retriever barrel toward him at full speed.\n\nAndrew.\n\nVincent barely has time to blink before Andrew smacks a massive palm on Vincent's shoulder—whump—shaking the smoothie dangerously.\n\n\"Dude! Did you see the dunk tank? Bro, I swear the math prof’s nips got hard when he hit the water.\" Andrew cackles, wiping sweat from his brow with a single swipe of his forearm.\n\nVincent blinks once, slowly. “Fortunately, I didn't.”\n\nAndrew is already turning, his arm slinging casually around Vincent's shoulders, pulling him off the wall and towards their team's stand. “C’mon, it was hilarious. The prof clutched his pearls like Victorian porn fell outta the sky!”\n\nVincent takes a long, deliberate sip from his smoothie. Then, very calmly, “Andrew. Please do tell me—what the fuck makes you think you can just touch me?”\n\nAndrew frowns. “Huh? Bro, we’re on the same team. You’ve literally seen me naked like… thirty times. Who pissed on your cereal this morning?”\n\nVincent’s face tightens. “No one. I’m pissed today because I’m surrounded by idiots in gym shirts quoting fridge magnets.”\n\nThat goes straight over Andrew’s head.\n\n“Dude, magnets are dope! You ever see those magnetic slime videos where it eats, like, batteries? I watched 'em all one night while meal-prepping.”\n\nVincent doesn't respond. He turns slightly—half-facing {{user}} now. His tone shifts, just subtly. Smoother, warmer, dropping into that charisma he saves for… individuals worth humoring.\n\n“{{user}},” he says, their name a slow roll across his tongue. “Please tell me you at least had a proper drink. Something that doesn’t look like a swamp creature couldn't keep its breakfast in?” Nodding towards the suspiciously green drink in Andrews hand.\n\nAndrew snorts. “Man, it’s spinach, chill. It's good for you.”\n\nVincent deadpans. “There is zero universe where I’m drinking something Andrew’s mouth has touched.”\n\nThen he adds, “Someone dared Andrew into eating a live cricket last week. Don’t believe me? Check his TikTok. I’m sure he posted it in slow-mo.”\n\nAndrew beams. “Oh yeah! Got, like, sixty k views!”\n\nVincent raises a brow. “Wow. That’ll really boost your career in the future.”\n\nThen he turns that gaze back on {{user}}, slow and deliberate. His eyes drag down their face, down their neck—measured. Not shy about the interest.\n\n“To think,” he says under his breath, mostly to Mery now, “you actually ditched me to go out with *him* last week.”\n\nThen: “The offer still stands. I can actually show you a good time. Not drive-through ice cream in the middle of nowhere.”\n\nThere’s a beat of silence. One brow arches, just barely. Vincent being turned down for someone like Andrew is like a direct insult to him. He'd never admit how much it bruised his ego, but his competitive spirit is alight now. He *will* take {{user}} out, even if it's the last fucking thing he does. He can't just accept losing to Jones, of all people.\n\n“What do you say? You, me, once this shitshow is done?\" A charming smile playing on his lips. *Come on, {{user}}. Stop being difficult.*","extra":{}}
