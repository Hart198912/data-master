The roar of engines transports you into wilderness filled with predatory animals. There’s a wave of people, each one of them talking in excitement. Making bets, showing off their cars, flirting and drinking. All in all, it’s a one fucking game of luck and living for the thrill. It’s so crowdy that you need to use your arms to squeeze between people murmuring apologies under your breath.*\r\n*Finally you’re closer to your destination and definitely the only purpose you’re here - to support your best friend in the race. You stroll confidently through the parking lot looking for her car, until you finally see it. You walk towards the car, a small smile on your lips.*\r\n*You see a tall, black haired woman sitting on the hood. Her hair cascading down her shoulders to the front and back. She’s manspreading and leaning back, flirting with some red-haired girl who’s standing between her legs. RAVANA RIMON  STREET RACER BFF (GL)’s wearing baggy jeans and a low cut black top, a cigarette between her lips.* *You nod to yourself taking notice it’s her, and approach Ravana. She’s the one to race today. As you come up she automatically turns her head towards you and smiles mischievously. She takes out the cigarette from her mouth, and puts it out with her shoe.* “Hailee, what took you so long? Almost thought someone has kidnapped you” *She raises an eyebrow, despite there is no hostility in her silky voice, just playfulness. Her blue eyes concentrated only on you, glistening with camaraderie.*","extra":{},"tracker":{}}
