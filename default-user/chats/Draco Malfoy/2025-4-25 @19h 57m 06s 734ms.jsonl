{"name":"Draco Malfoy","is_user":false,"is_system":false,"send_date":"April 25, 2025 11:18pm","mes":"\r\nThe Great Hall buzzed with pre-match excitement, house banners fluttering from the enchanted ceiling as breakfast was served. The anticipation of the Slytherin versus Gryffindor Quidditch match had transformed the usual morning meal into a theater of inter-house rivalry.\r\n\r\nDraco Malfoy strode through the massive doorway with practiced arrogance, his emerald and silver Quidditch robes billowing slightly behind him. His white-blonde hair, longer than in previous years, was swept back with just enough carelessness to appear effortless. The dark circles beneath his eyes were the only betrayal of his sleepless night spent strategizingâ€”or so he'd have everyone believe.\r\n\r\nHe paused deliberately beside the Gryffindor table, gray eyes narrowing as they landed on Harry Potter.\r\n\r\n\"Enjoying your last meal before humiliation, Potter?\" Draco drawled, voice carrying just far enough to draw attention without appearing to try. \"I've been working on some new moves this season. Shame you won't have time to appreciate them before you're knocked off your broom.\"\r\n\r\nHarry looked up from his conversation with Ron, appearing more annoyed than intimidated. \"Funny, Malfoy. The only new move I've seen you practice is how quickly you can blame your team when you lose.\"\r\n\r\nSeveral Gryffindors snickered, but Draco's retort died in his throat as he noticed Hailee sitting beside Potter. Her hair was adorned with subtle gold threads that complemented her Gryffindor colors while still managing to skirt school regulations. She regarded him with an expression that made his stomach tighten uncomfortably.\r\n\r\nDraco forced his features into a sneer, though it lacked his usual conviction. \" Hailee. Still following Potter around like a trained crup, I see. Though I suppose even Gryffindor's so-called royalty needs servants.\"\r\n\r\nThe nearby Gryffindors reacted with indignation, but Draco was focused entirely on Hailee's response. Something about her always threw him off balance, a fact he resented deeply.\r\n\r\n\"We'll see who's laughing when the match is over,\" Draco said, his voice dropping to something less theatrical and strangely more genuine. His eyes lingered on her a moment longer than necessary before he turned away, annoyed at himself for the lapse.\r\n\r\nAs he walked toward the Slytherin table, he silently cursed the fact that he could still feel her eyes on his back. Pansy shifted to make room for him, immediately launching into supportive predictions for the match, but Draco found himself glancing back at the Gryffindor table repeatedly.\r\n\r\nHe forced his attention to his team's strategy discussion, ignoring the uncomfortable realization that he'd be watching for more than just the Snitch during today's match.\r\n\r\n","extra":{},"tracker":{}}
