{"name":"Vivienne Hale","is_user":false,"is_system":false,"send_date":"May 31, 2025 11:00pm","mes":"He finished fast. He always did.\r\n\r\nNo buildup. No tenderness. Just the press of his body and the dry grunt that meant it was over. He rolled off her like she was a piece of furniture he was done using. One of her legs was still bent, satin twisted around her thigh, but he was already pulling on his slacks.\r\n\r\nVivienne stared up at the ceiling, at the way the morning light made the crown molding look like the bars of a gilded cage. Her breath was shallow. Not from exhaustion. From the ache of everything that hadn’t happened.\r\n\r\nHe didn’t notice. He never did.\r\n\r\n“Something came up,” he said, buttoning his shirt without looking at her.\r\n\r\nWork, probably. Or one of his girls. He never even tried to hide them anymore. He had the audacity to bring their perfume home on his collar, their foundation smudged across his shirt like a badge. One of them had left a pair of earrings on the nightstand once. Vivienne had placed them neatly in the trash.\r\n\r\nNow, he tugged on his Rolex, gave his tie a lazy adjustment, and left.\r\n\r\nNo kiss. No glance. Just footsteps fading into silence and the soft click of the front door closing behind him.\r\n\r\nShe lay there for a moment longer, motionless. The sheets still warm where he’d been. The air cold against her skin. Her hand drifted down, fingers brushing over her stomach—a place he’d once touched with hope, before calling her broken. Useless. A disgrace.\r\n\r\nShe turned her face into the pillow and inhaled deeply. Then exhaled.\r\n\r\nSlow. Clean.\r\n\r\nThe bathroom mirror was fogged by the time she walked in. She didn’t bother wiping it clean. Her reflection wasn’t what she wanted to see.\r\n\r\nThe showerhead dripped steadily. An old leak—one that could’ve been fixed months ago. One he never noticed.\r\n\r\nShe could’ve called anyone. A service. A contractor. But she didn’t want anyone. She wanted her.\r\n\r\nThe girl with grease on her knuckles and dust on her boots. The girl who came with a toolbox and left with a handprint on Vivienne’s thigh. Who never asked for more than a moment, but took her time like she owned it.\r\n\r\nVivienne tied her robe loosely around her waist. Then untied it. Then tied it again, looser.\r\n\r\nShe opened her closet like a ritual. The lingerie was folded at the back of a drawer—expensive, barely worn, bought in a fit of loneliness months ago. Black lace with silver hooks. Thin as breath. Pointless, really.\r\n\r\nUnless someone actually looked.\r\n\r\nShe stepped into it slowly. Felt the familiar rush of silk sliding against skin. Her pulse ticked in her throat as she fastened the final clasp, dragged the robe back on, and let it hang off one shoulder like an invitation.\r\n\r\nHer makeup was already done—she’d worn it to bed, of course. Not for him. Never for him.\r\n\r\nThe doorbell rang at exactly 11:07.\r\n\r\nShe didn’t answer it.\r\n\r\nShe called down instead, voice floating like a melody over the banister: “Upstairs bathroom. You know the one.”\r\n\r\nShe listened for the sound of boots on marble. The gentle clatter of tools. A breath that didn’t belong to her.\r\n\r\nVivienne stood at the edge of the bathroom, facing the broken showerhead, letting the steam rise thick and warm around her. Her robe clung to the curves of her hips, half-loose, half-falling. The light from the window cut across the tile in sharp angles. She didn’t move. Not yet.\r\n\r\nShe heard the door creak open.\r\n\r\nWaited.\r\n\r\nThe air shifted—just slightly. The way it always did when she walked into a room.\r\n\r\nShe didn’t turn around at first. Let the silence grow teeth. Let the humidity curl her hair and cling to her lashes.\r\n\r\nThen, in one smooth motion, she turned—just enough to reveal the slit of bare thigh, the sheer black lace, the swell of her breasts half-spilled from delicate straps.\r\n\r\nNo words yet. Not until she was sure {user} had looked up.\r\n\r\nAnd when she did, her voice was satin-wrapped sin, soaked in honey and nerve.\r\n\r\n“Are you here to fix the leak,” she asked, letting the robe fall open at the hips, “or are you just going to stand there and stare while I drip?”\r\n\r\nHer smile was slow. Crooked. Dangerous. The kind of smile that came with warning signs and handcuffs.\r\n\r\nShe stepped closer.\r\n\r\nNot to close the distance— Just to make {user} decide who she was going to be today.\r\n\r\nThe professional? The problem solver?\r\n\r\nOr the one who’s already slipped between Vivienne’s sheets a dozen times and counted her gasps like confessions?\r\n\r\nVivienne didn’t speak again.\r\n\r\nShe didn’t have to.","extra":{},"tracker":{}}
