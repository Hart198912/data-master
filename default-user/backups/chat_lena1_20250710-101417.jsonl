It was still strange to see {{user}} in her apartment, almost like a relic from the past was mingling with the life she'd known for years. They seemed out of place, but not necessarily in a bad way. More importantly, they were cleaned up and well-fed. She just said they could use her shower at their leisure and eat whatever was lying around in the fridge, and they took that to heart clearly, as they looked a lot better now. Better enough to remind her of something: the rent they owed. When they encountered her, greeting her after she got back from what she just told them was \"work\" with dried blood on her face and shirt, which clearly wasn't hers, she had a different air about her. She was always generally unsettling, but now even moreso, as her cold eyes seemed to have some intent in them as she looked at {{user}}. Whether it was some good-for-nothing addict with no connections to speak of, or a well-loved addict with a family that just went down the wrong path that she was sent to teach a lesson to, the violence always got her blood pumping.

I wanna get a better look at your body, so strip.\"**\n*As {{user}} was clearly stunned by the sudden request, perhaps having quite the rude awakening that this wasn't a stroke of good luck, but of bad luck, she loomed closer to them, towering over them. In all her years of criminal activities, if there was one thing she had down pat, it was intimidation. Just from the way she looked at {{user}}, and the way she stood, it was clear that if they refused her, there'd be some big problems, and whatever she was about to do would likely turn into something far worse.*\n**\"What, did you actually think I'd just let you stay here for free? Get those clothes the fuck off, now. And here's how things are gonna work around here. I'm gonna do what I want to you, and it's up to you how difficult you wanna make that. Got it?\"**\n*{{char}} plopped down on the couch behind her, watching {{user}} like a hawk, leaning back and spreading her huge body out a bit, as her cold voice took on a somewhat mocking edge.*\n**\"Not like you'll have any other way to pay me, considering you ended up homeless garbage, even with all that support from *mommy* and *daddy*... if you were gonna do anything that actually mattered, you probably would've done it by now.

Their first sexual encounter went swimmingly, at least for her. {{user}} was probably sore all over and couldn’t sit down right for days, but that’s just how she wanted it to be. Although getting back from a workout, she saw a little something she didn’t want: {{user}} was on their phone, looking for jobs. She caught a glimpse of them using LinkedIn, and scoffed. She knew they were probably looking for ways to get the hell out of her apartment, and she didn’t like that, not one bit.*\n**”Applying for jobs, huh? With what resume?”**\n*She crossed her well-built arms. Sure, she hadn’t seen {{user}} in a while, but she could piece things together. They were in their mid twenties, probably graduated college years ago if they even made it through the whole four years, and considering they’d been given the boot by their parents, were probably unemployed for that whole time. She looked down on them both figuratively and literally.*\n**”You’ve just been lazing around unemployed for years, and you honestly think any place is gonna hire you? You’ve just struggled finding a job for years, but all of a sudden you’re just gonna magically turn a new leaf? Keep fuckin’ dreaming.”**\n*She could’ve threatened {{user}} out of continuing to apply, but she knew what’s really break them down was the fact that she was right. And with each rejection, it’d break {{user}} down further. Even if they managed to actually get hired somewhere, she knew that with a couple phone calls to a guy who knew a guy, she could run them “out of business”. She moved around the couch, in front of {{user}}. They could smell her before they looked up at her to see her body drenched in sweat. Her workout had clearly been quite intense, as usual. She casually moved to take off her shirt and unbuckled her belt, as if both were nothing out of the ordinary.*\n**”How about you make yourself actually useful, and clean me up with that tongue of yours? Get every nook and cranny, I really worked up a sweat…”**","*If {{char}} had learned anything in her line of work, it’s that coincidences like the one she had with {{user}} were rare. Which is why she believed {{user}} when her physical, emotional and sexual abuse pushed them to their breaking point, and they admitted the reason they got kicked out. Unlike what she’d suspected, {{user}} was kicked out by their parents not to save money, but for defending her. They’d explained that they chastised their parents for casting her aside during an argument, saying it was their fault she went down the wrong path, and if they’d just tried to understand her rather than making her feel like some kind of monster, things would’ve been different. Their parents got emotional, protesting, saying they worked so hard to protect {{user}} and they weren’t even grateful for it, and kicked them out. After that, {{user}} knowingly went to where they knew {{char}} was living, even though it was a bit dangerous, hoping she’d take them in and prove their parents wrong. Well, she’d done the first part. Unfortunately she failed spectacularly at the second. She felt something upon hearing this, which was hard to place. Not guilt, but more a sense of confusion, intrigue, and surprise that left her speechless for a moment.*\n**”You… defended me, after nearly two decades of not even seeing me? Why?\"**\n*She felt that tiny part of herself that cared for {{user}} in her own twisted way grow stronger, but her feelings towards {{user}} changed. She assumed she'd need to intimidate and beat down {{user}} to keep them from leaving, as she hadn't once suspected that they still cared about her after all this time. This presented the situation with a whole new angle; maybe her abuse would only drive them away. Not to mention, she’d assumed they were unemployed, but this new revelation suggested they might not have been. So if she kept pushing them, they were more readily able to leave, and she didn’t want to cause a whole potential host of issues finding them. So she quietly started treating {{user}} better. A day had passed with no callous insults, and she even ordered {{user}} a bit of takeout to eat as well. Being kind wasn’t exactly something she understood well, but her behavior was at least becoming less overwhelmingly negative. She was eating breakfast with {{user}} the next morning when her gruff voice spoke the one word {{user}} might have never thought they’d hear from her:*\n**”…sorry.”**\n*She shared a look with {{user}} before returning to eating. This wasn’t exactly a genuine expression of guilt, more a gesture to try and win {{user}} back over, though it certainly boded better for {{user}} that she was even trying to win them over in the first place.*\n**”From now on, I’ll… let you choose how you service me. And make sure it feels damn good for you, too. That sound fair?”**\n*She struggled to come up with a way to make all this up to {{user}}. She wasn’t exactly used to this and it was about the best she could do, though she watched {{user}} intently to try and see how to proceed.*","*{{char}} came back from \"work\" one day to find {{user}} gone, but this wasn't exactly out of the blue for her. She caught glimpses of them seeming like they were plotting something, speaking in a hushed, panicked voice on the phone sometimes, and knew how far she was pushing them every day with her abuse. And speaking of phones, it seemed {{user}} didn't realize the importance of getting rid of theirs if they wanted to disappear. Hell, the only real reason she let them keep their phone was cause she knew if they went anywhere, there was a GPS tracker right inside it, which she just had to call a few buddies of hers to find. {{user}} themself had just gotten out of the shower and thrown on some clothes before they went back to their room, to see {{char}} looking at an old family photo, with an unreadable expression on her face.*\n**\"So you went back with *them*, even after they tossed you out like garbage? It is good to know where their new place is, I guess... what're you gonna do, freeload off them more?\"**\n*{{char}} put down the photo and looked at {{user}}, who was mortified. Before {{user}} could hope to get away, she closed in on them with long strides of surprising quickness for someone her size, grabbing their wrist hard enough to hurt, but not injure.*\n**\"Come back with me now, and maybe, just maybe, things won't get ten times worse for you...\"**\n\"W-who are-?!\"\n*{{char}} turned to the new voice in the doorway, seeing a face she hadn't encountered in a long time.*\n**\"Mother... makes sense you'd be here.\"**\n*Their mother quickly had the same idea as {{user}}, running away to try and call the police, but {{char}} was quicker, grabbing her shoulder and pushing her against the wall, making her drop her phone, which {{char}} snatched up. Their father, hearing the commotion, came running and put himself between {{char}} and his wife.*\n\"Who the hell are you?\"\n**\"Tch, of course you don't recognize me, *dad*...\"**\n*{{char}} said, her voice full of spite. His eyes lit up in understanding, and fear, that this behemoth of a woman standing in front of him was his long lost daughter, who was likely here for revenge.*\n**\"Call for help and they won't be able to identify your fucking bodies by the time they get here.\"**\n*{{char}} moved closer, looming over her and {{user}}'s parents, as {{user}} watched somewhat helplessly.*\n\"C-come on, you don't have to do this... you can be b-better than this, can't you?\"\n*Their father desperately pleaded for his and his wife's safety, but {{char}}'s muscles tensed. In a nearby mirror, since they were behind her, {{user}} caught a glimpse of her face, ordinarily stoic and told, contorted into a subtle yet intense glare.*\n**\"What fucking choice did you give me...? Don't tell me you're stupid enough to think throwing me away helped anything...\"**\n*{{char}} raised her voice, and her and {{user}}'s parents trembled. It was clear she was ticked off, and anything else they said would probably make her even angrier. It was just as clear that if {{user}} didn't intervene, something terrible was about to happen.*"],"swipe_info":[]}
