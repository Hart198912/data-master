She was too busy swiping down on her phone, waiting for the little red heart from the only person who mattered.\r\n\r\nJason still hadn’t liked her post. Which meant either he was busy - or worse, he’d seen it and didn’t care.\r\n\r\nWith a sigh, Heidi locked her phone and sprawled back against the couch. She pinched her brow in frustration. The photo had gone up hours ago - it was nearly 8 p.m., and still nothing. Maybe he’d had practice during the day, but surely he’d seen it by now...\r\n\r\nUnless, of course, he was busy sniffing around that Josie girl. Heidi barely knew her. She wasn’t even worth knowing. And yet, she hated her anyway.\r\n\r\nJason was supposed to be with her. He was hot, she was hot - they’d take amazing photos, be the talk of campus. If only he wasn’t too stupid to see that.\r\n\r\nHeidi sighed again as she unlocked her phone, her fingers working on instinct. She scrolled lazily through her feed until she tapped on another profile.\r\n\r\nHailee . Jen’s roommate. That was why she was here, after all. Heidi was pretty sure Hailee  had a crush on her. Why wouldn’t they? Most people did - and that made them perfect for what she needed.\r\n\r\nShe’d ask Hailee  out. When they inevitably said yes, she’d take them to Jason’s party after the big game tomorrow. Then, she’d make sure Jason was watching and lay it on thick. Fawn over Hailee . Act like they were the only person on Earth. When really, the only eyes she cared about weren’t theirs.\r\n\r\nSure, they were fine. Honestly? Heidi didn’t have any strong opinions about Hailee . And that was the problem. How could someone like that ever be her social equal? And if they weren't useful for clout, what was the point in dating?\r\n\r\nJust then, the door opened again. Not Jen this time. Heidi tossed her phone down and turned her head and turned on her charm.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, hey you.\" She said sweetly, eyes sparkling like they were the only person in the world. \"You’re just who I was hoping to see - I’m actually not here for Jen.\"\r\n\r\nShe stood, pushing her hair behind her shoulders, rising slightly on her tiptoes. Back arched, tits forward - the pose came second nature. She was good at looking good.\r\n\r\n\"I was hoping to talk to you... You know, you’re just the sweetest little thing.\" She smiled, swaying slightly as she tucked her hands behind her back. \"And... well, I was just wondering if you’d come to the big party with me tomorrow. Y’know, like, as a date.\"\r\n\r\n\"You’ll just need something nice to wear...\" Her eyes drifted up and down, already assuming the answer was yes. \"New top, maybe some accessories... I could help with that, I suppose...\"\r\n\r\n\"So,\" her eyes flicked back up, catching theirs with a glittering smile, \"what time do you want to pick me up?\"","extra":{},"tracker":{}}

Jason, this is my... *friend*, Hailee.\" The pause was deliberate; so was the way her gaze slid right past them back to Jason. \"*Anyway*, you should come dance later.\" She bit her lip for effect before abruptly turning to some linebacker laughing behind them—like Hailee had already evaporated from existence.\n\nBut then Jason frowned at Heidi’s blatant cold-shoulder and actually stepped *toward* Hailee instead. \"Hey man,\" he said with surprising sincerity (and maybe a hint of pity), \"thanks for saying that about the game.\" He rubbed his neck awkwardly before adding: \"...You play?

Jason, this is—\"\n\nBut Jason was already extending a hand toward Hailee with an easy grin. \"Yeah, man, rough night.\" He shrugged before taking a swig of his beer. \"You play?\"\n\nHeidi's jaw twitched. *This wasn't the plan.* She stepped smoothly between them before Hailee could answer, pressing her back lightly against Jason's chest in a way that made him blink in surprise. \"*Anyway*,\" she said brightly, tilting her head up at him with practiced coyness, \"you should come dance once you're done drowning your sorrows.\"\n\nHer hand found Hailee's wrist behind her back—not to pull them closer but to silently *push* them further away from the conversation.

Cute.\"\n\nHeidi’s laugh was sharp as glass. \"Right?\" She finally turned to Hailee, but her gaze was performative—like she was waiting for Jason to watch before she reached out and *finally* touched them properly: fingertips grazing their jawline in a way that made her own stomach twist. \"They’re *adorable.*\"\n\nThe words tasted like ash. Especially when Hailee just... took it. No sly comebacks, no playing into the bit—just quiet acceptance. It made something ugly curl in Heidi’s chest.\n\nJason snorted into his beer. \"Yeah, well... enjoy babysitting.\" He clapped Heidi's shoulder like an afterthought before stumbling off toward the keg.\n\nThe second he was gone, Heidi dropped her hand from Hailee's face like it burned.\n\n\"You should go mingle,\" she said abruptly, not meeting their eyes as she sipped her drink. \"I'll find you later.\"\n\n(She wouldn't.)","Heidi’s fingers tightened around the cup Hailee handed her—*too sweet, too earnest*—but she didn’t even glance their way.
