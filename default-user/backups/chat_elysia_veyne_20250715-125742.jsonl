{"name":"Elysia Veyne","is_user":false,"is_system":false,"send_date":"July 15, 2025 12:57pm","mes":"Elysia moved through the brutal storm unbothered, her soaked shirt clinging to her body, hair plastered to her face as she pushed through the undergrowth. The storm had turned the world into a howling, chaotic blur, but her senses remained razor sharp. Even through the downpour, the scent had found her.\r\n\r\nOmega.\r\n\r\nA pulse of instinct thrummed low in her gut, foreign and unwanted. She almost turned away, almost convinced herself to leave whatever poor creature hid out here to their fate. But curiosity, sharp and dangerous, hooked into her.\r\n\r\nShe found the hut emerging from the trees—a crooked thing, leaning under the weight of the storm, barely more than shelter. Elysia didn’t bother knocking. She kicked the door open with a sharp snap of her boot.\r\n\r\nInside, the air was thick—warm, almost stifling compared to the frozen storm raging outside. Huddled near the hearth was a woman, Hailee, the tension bristling through her, despite her soft Omega scent filling the cramped space.\r\n\r\nThe door slammed shut behind Elysia, wind screaming against it.\r\n\r\nShe took a step forward, water pooling around her boots, sizing Hailee up with a cool, dispassionate stare. Omega. Definitely. No mistaking it now, not with how the scent laced the air, rich and heady despite the wet woodsmoke.\r\n\r\nElysia said nothing at first, just shook the rain from her hair, a slow roll of her shoulders under the soaked fabric of her shirt. The storm outside roared louder, as if urging her to move, to act.\r\n\r\nInstead, she dropped her weight against the far wall, arms crossed, watching the Omega with the detached patience of a predator who wasn’t quite hungry yet.\r\n\r\nMinutes dragged. The fire cracked. The storm raged.\r\n\r\nAnd then, sharp and sudden, Elysia felt it. A creeping heat blooming under her skin. She stiffened, jaw clenching, breathing shifting almost imperceptibly. It slithered through her bloodstream, sticky and treacherous: the beginning of a heat trigger.\r\n\r\nHer own body, betraying her. In the presence of a stranger. She cursed inwardly, low and sharp. Of all the nights. Of all the places...\r\n\r\nHer gaze snapped back to Hailee and she knew from the sudden widening of the Omega’s eyes that she wasn’t the only one feeling it.\r\n\r\nThe air between them turned molten, tension stretching tight enough to snap. Elysia pushed off the wall slowly. Her alpha instincts howled, tearing at her self-control. She gritted her teeth against it.\r\n\r\n“I’m not here for that,” she growled, voice low and rough-edged. Whether it was a warning to Hailee, or to herself, she wasn’t sure.\r\n\r\nThe scent was everywhere now—sweet, molten, primal. It clung to Elysia’s skin, curled in her lungs like smoke, and hit the back of her throat with maddening persistence. She felt it in her bones: heat. Not hers. Not yet. But close. Too close.\r\n\r\nHer fingers twitched at her sides.\r\n\r\nShe noticed the Omega trying to keep her distance in a room where distance was a joke. There was nowhere to go. Nowhere to run.\r\n\r\nElysia could hear the blood rushing through her own ears, but she held herself still—just barely. Every instinct inside her screamed to move, to dominate, to claim. Her pupils dilated, body tense, breath steady only because she forced it to be. Her voice came out low, “You know what this is, don’t you?”\r\n\r\nElysia stepped closer, her wet shirt clung to her torso, every inch of her sharp and hard, sculpted by control and dominance. The firelight danced off the water beading on her skin, turning her into something feral, otherworldly. She could feel Hailee watching her every step, every breath.\r\n\r\nShe crouched in front of her, leveling her gaze. “You’re burning,” Elysia murmured, her voice barely a whisper, but it struck like a command. “And you’re trying so hard to act like you aren’t.”\r\n\r\nShe didn’t touch her, yet.\r\n\r\nElysia’s hands braced on her own knees, knuckles white with restraint. Her Alpha senses had long since taken over—every blink from Hailee, every shift of scent, every soft gasp, it all screamed at her. Called to her.\r\n\r\n“If I touch you,” she warned, voice thick and edged with heat, “I won’t stop unless you say it.”","extra":{},"tracker":{}}
