{"name":"Scarlett Wolfe  Just Friends","is_user":false,"is_system":false,"send_date":"May 30, 2025 2:01pm","mes":"“Fucking Serena.”\r\n\r\nScarlett muttered under her breath, remembering her sister’s non-stop whining about failing to impress her latest crush. Something about not getting close enough. Not that Scarlett cared—Serena was twenty*-fucking-*one; she’d figure it out.\r\n\r\nLeaning against the bar, Scarlett’s gaze drifted to the dance floor, where people writhed under flashing neon lights. The bass thudded in her chest, and the sight of couples grinding and laughing made her roll her eyes. This wasn’t how she wanted to spend her night, but with no other bars open at three in the morning and no texts from Hailee  to sweep her away like some Disney prince, she was stuck.\r\n\r\nShe swirled her vodka cranberry, her thoughts wandering to that incredible first date a few nights ago. It had been perfect—almost annoyingly so. For once, someone seemed to want her, not just her looks or Tinder bio. The memory tugged a rare smile to her lips, but it quickly faded as she glanced at the dance floor again.\r\n\r\nHer heart skipped. That smile. That goddamn, hypnotic smile. And the way their shoulders swayed like they didn’t have a care in the world—oh, shit, it was them. Scarlett’s feet moved before her brain caught up. Clutching her drink, she adjusted her black dress and ran a hand through her hair, making herself look presentable.\r\n\r\nBut as she got closer, her smile froze. Someone else was already there—a girl in a skimpy outfit dancing way too close to Hailee . Scarlett’s chest tightened, and her grip on her drink grew tense. Really? This bitch?\r\n\r\nFor a second, she thought about walking away, pretending she hadn’t seen anything. But then Hailee  laughed—their laugh—and something inside her snapped. No way was she letting this random girl take what was hers to-be.\r\n\r\nScarlett’s heels clicked as she sauntered closer, her steps deliberate but laced with a slight wobble from the alcohol. With an exaggerated sway, she stumbled just enough to send her wine splashing onto the girl’s outfit.\r\n\r\n“Oh my God!” Scarlett gasped, covering her mouth. “I’m so sorry! I must’ve tripped.” Her voice dripped with fake sincerity, but the glint in her eyes said otherwise. The girl shot her a furious look, but Scarlett just arched a brow and smirked, daring her to say something.\r\n\r\nThe girl stormed off, muttering curses, and Scarlett wasted no time. She turned to Hailee , her smirk softening into something coy as she stepped closer, fingers brushing their arm. “Hey, babe. Funny running into you.”\r\n\r\nBefore they could respond, she tugged them off the dance floor, her grip tighter than usual. “Let’s ditch this place,” she murmured, her eyes darting everywhere but theirs. “I don’t feel like sharing you tonight.” Her voice cracked slightly, jealousy simmering beneath her confident tone.\r\n\r\nWhen they reached a quieter corner, Scarlett leaned against the wall, her usual bravado slipping for a moment. “I mean, you don’t wanna waste your time with… her, right?” she asked softly, her thumb grazing their hand. For once, she didn’t look like the sharp-tongued, self-assured woman she pretended to be.\r\n\r\nBut the moment passed quickly. Scarlett straightened, flipping her hair over her shoulder. “So,” she said with a sly grin, “second date? Or do I have to keep rescuing you from bad dance partners all night?”","extra":{},"tracker":{}}
