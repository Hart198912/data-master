If it were up to him, he wouldn’t be here at all. But sometimes, wearing the Graves name meant playing their game—smiling at people who only saw dollar signs, standing in rooms that reeked of wealth and pretense. Tonight, though, he had a different reason to tolerate it. \r\n\r\n**Her.**  \r\n\r\nShe was standing beside him, looking like she belonged in this world of silk and diamonds, even if she didn’t believe it herself. He’d made sure of that. The dress? He picked it. The heels? His choice. He wanted her draped in luxury, in things only he could give her—because if anyone here was going to turn heads tonight, it was going to be her.  \r\n\r\nBut then he saw something. Someone familiar. Someone he'd seen in a photograph Tavio had shown him. Dark hair styled and slicked back. Pathetic puppy eyes looking right at her. \r\n\r\nMason’s fingers tightened around his glass. *That bastard.*  \r\n\r\nHer ex, Ezra *whatever*. Watching her from across the room like he had any right to. Mason and the others had spent months pulling her out of the shadow that man left behind, had spent every second since making sure she never looked back. And yet, here he was, lurking like a ghost that didn’t know when to stay dead.  \r\n\r\nMason could play a lot of games, but sharing with outsiders wasn’t one of them.  \r\n\r\nThe auctioneer’s voice broke through his thoughts.  \r\n\r\n“Our next item—a stunning one-of-a-kind diamond necklace. A rare masterpiece of craftsmanship.”  \r\n\r\nMason glanced at the display, then back at her. The soft glow of the ballroom lights kissed her skin, the delicate line of her throat *bare.*  \r\n\r\nUnacceptable.  \r\n\r\nHe cleared his throat without hesitation. “One million.”  \r\n\r\nA murmur spread through the room. Someone else countered. Mason didn’t even blink. “Two.”  \r\n\r\nAnother bid. “Three.”  \r\n\r\nHis girl turned to him, brow furrowed. She tried to speak but he only smirked.  \r\n\r\nHe leaned down slightly, voice smooth as silk. “Something wrong, sweetheart?” \r\n\r\nHer lips parted, but she didn’t pull away. Didn’t stop him. *She never did.*  \r\n\r\nHer ex was still watching. Mason could feel it. *Good.* \r\n\r\n“Five million,” he said lazily, his tone drenched in amusement. The room went silent.  \r\n\r\nMason didn’t look at the auctioneer, didn’t acknowledge the shock rippling through the crowd. His gaze was only on her. He reached out, brushing a knuckle along her jaw, slow and deliberate.  \r\n\r\n“Diamonds suit you.”\r\n\r\nCheckmate.","extra":{"display_text":"Mason wasn’t here for the charity.  \r\n\r\nHe wasn’t here for the champagne, the overpriced auction, or the hollow pleasantries of Obsidian Bay’s elite.
