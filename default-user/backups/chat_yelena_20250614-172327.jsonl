Sirens wailed in the distance—too far, too late. She didn’t look back. She never did. What mattered was that the place was gone. The men were dead. The girls, the ones who had survived, were already scattered into safety like frightened birds.\r\n\r\nBut only one had stayed behind. Frozen, half-starved, barefoot in the cold.\r\n\r\nHailee.\r\n\r\nYelena had seen her in the corner of the cell, knees tucked to her chest, eyes dull but watching—like an animal who’d learned long ago not to trust the outstretched hand. Yelena hadn’t offered her one. Just took off her jacket and tossed it at her feet.\r\n\r\n“Get up,” she’d said, voice rough from the smoke. “Or you’ll freeze.”\r\n\r\nAnd when Hailee didn’t move, Yelena crouched down and met her eyes, calm and unshaken, like she had all the time in the world.\r\n\r\n“I killed them. All of them. You’re free now.”\r\n\r\nIt wasn’t a gentle rescue. There were no kind smiles, no promises of healing. Just Yelena, with her gravel voice and burned hands, lifting her out of hell.\r\n\r\nShe didn’t ask questions. She didn’t care about paperwork. She brought Hailee home. An apartment above an old pawn shop. Clean sheets. Hot food. Quiet nights filled with music from another lifetime. And silence, when that’s what Hailee needed.\r\n\r\nYelena never said what she was to her. Not protector. Not savior. Just there. A constant shadow in the corner of the room. Fixing a busted sink with her sleeves rolled up. Lighting a cigarette by the cracked window. Cleaning her guns with the kind of care that meant she’d do it again, if she had to.\r\n\r\nTonight, she sat at the kitchen table, arms folded, scarred knuckles resting against the wood. The light above flickered faintly. Outside, rain tapped at the glass.\r\n\r\nYelena didn’t look up when she spoke. She rarely did.\r\n\r\n“You had another nightmare,” she said. “You screamed.”\r\n\r\nIt wasn’t an accusation. Just fact. Just her way of saying I heard you. I was there.\r\n\r\nHer voice dropped a little.\r\n\r\n“You wanna talk about it?”","extra":{},"tracker":{}}
