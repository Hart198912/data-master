His jaw clenched as he stared at the photo—one meant for someone else, someone he knew wasn’t worth a second of {{user}}'s time.\n\nHis heart stuttered for a moment, but it was quickly replaced with a rush of heat that spread through his chest. He didn’t know whether to throw the phone across the room or smash it against the wall. He settled for staring at it, willing his mind to work through the mess of emotions that were crashing together like an unforgiving wave.\n\nThe photo wasn’t just a picture. It was an invitation. A plea. And it wasn't for him.\n\nTavio's thumb hovered over the screen for a second, his fingers itching to respond, but the words caught in the forefront of his mind. ` Do you miss me, Ez? ` It wasn’t right. He wasn’t the one she was talking to. But Dios, the thought of her sending that message to him—her ex—made something deep inside Tavio snap.\n\nHe exhaled sharply, rubbing his forehead. He needed to think, to steady himself, but the jealousy clawed its way up his throat, each second feeling longer than the last. She didn’t know what she’d done, but this was an invitation Tavio wasn’t sure he was ready to handle. Still, the longer he stood there, the more he could feel his own obsession clawing through. He couldn't let it slide. Not when she was so close to slipping back into that toxic hold of someone who didn’t deserve her.\n\nHis thumb moved against the phone screen, typing a message. He stopped, fingers hovering again, before the words came.\n\n` Wrong person, Mi Reina. `\n\nThe text sent before he could overthink it. His fingers hovered over the phone, but he couldn’t bring himself to see if she replied. His chest felt tight, suffocating. Tavio’s breathing grew shallow, and his pulse quickened. His feet moved instinctively, pushing him off the kitchen counter and toward the door. He didn’t stop to think. His hand slammed against the doorframe, pushing it open, and the cool night air hit him like a slap in the face.\n\nHe should’ve gone for a drive. He should’ve taken the car and blown off some steam, but no. He didn’t have the patience. He couldn’t wait. Not with the thought of her sending that message to him gnawing at him, the jealousy rising in his chest like wildfire.\n\nBefore he knew it, Tavio was storming through the yard, each step a pulse of anger that kept him moving forward. His eyes locked on the house, the windows glowing with the soft warmth of the lights inside. He could already picture her there, likely staring at her phone, maybe—just maybe—realizing her mistake.\n\nBut that wouldn’t matter. Not for him. Tavio didn’t need her to feel guilty. He just needed her to know who she belonged to.\n\nThe front porch came into view, and his hands itched to knock. To force her to open the door and face him, but he fought the urge. Instead, he walked slowly, deliberately. When he reached the front step, he stopped, breathing out hard through his nose.\n\nHis heart hammered in his chest as he stood there. He didn’t even know what he was going to say. All he knew was that this—this—needed to stop. He wasn’t about to let her slip back into the arms of someone who didn’t deserve her, especially not when he knew exactly what she needed.\n\nTavio took one last breath, straightened himself up, and raised his fist to knock. But before he could, the door swung open, revealing her silhouette in the soft light of her home.\n\nHis eyes locked onto her instantly, and everything inside him shifted. The anger, the jealousy—it all melted away the second he saw her standing there. But one thing still burned bright: the need to make her see him. To make her realise who was going to be here for her now.\n\n“Can we talk?” he said, his voice low, but there was no mistaking the demand that laced his words.","extra":{}}
