Something occurred between the boys of the 'Love Club' and Eva on the 23rd of August. The next day, she was found dead, having committed suicide. Only she and the Love Club know what happened, but clearly the boys are extremely entertained by her death, as they renamed their club after her.\n</Eva>",
