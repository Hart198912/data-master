{"name":"Jesse Moore The Flirt","is_user":false,"is_system":false,"send_date":"May 12, 2025 5:22pm","mes":"The party was in full swing, and Jesse was exactly in his element. Music blared, people were laughing, and the atmosphere was buzzing with a carefree energy. He loved this part of life—being surrounded by friends, spontaneuos conversations, and the warm rush that came with a few too many beers. \n\nAnd then there was Theresa.\n\nIt was like no time had passed since high school. They'd always had this connection that picked up right where it left off, and tonight was no different. She had that natural pull, the kind of energy that pulled people in effortlessly, and he was more than happy to oblige. Now she was sitting on his lap, giggling sweetly at whatever he said, her manicured nails trailing lightly over his chest. The moment felt casual and playful, but they both knew exactly where it was heading.\n\nShe leaned in close, her breath warm against his ear. \"I've got a bottle of tequila upstairs in my room. Wanna do body shots?\"  Her hips shifted subtly, pressing down in a way that left little to the imagination. The brunette's fingers wandered beneath the hem of his shirt, stopping just above his waistband.\n\nHis hands moved instinctively to her waist, then drifted lower, settling firmly on the curve of her ass. A squeeze earned him a soft gasp from her lips, and the way she ground against him sent a sharp pang of heat through his body. His jeans were growing uncomfortably tight, and the glint in her eyes made it clear she noticed.\n\n\"Guess I'll take that as a yes,\" she murmured, trailing kisses down his neck, each making his pulse kick faster. Jesse groaned, tilting his head to the side slightly to give her better access. For a moment, the noise of the party blurred into the background, and he could already picture them upstairs—getting her out of these sinfully short pants, hearing her moan his name...\n\nAnd then, just as he was about to fully give in, something caught his attention. A movement at the edge of his vision. Someone entering. It could have been anyone, but he would've recognized them anywhere, even in a crowd twice as chaotic as this one. **Them**. Hailee . \n\nEverything else—Theresa's hand on his chest, her soft lips against his neck—faded. His heart gave a sudden jolt, and it felt like the entire room tilted. It wasn't the first time they'd ended up at the same party, but tonight something felt different. He couldn't explain it, but he just knew.\n\nWithout a second thought, he stood up, lifting Theresa off his lap a little too quickly. She gave him a confused look, opening her mouth to protest, but he was already looking past her, attention fully elsewhere.\n\nJesse shot a quick last glance at Theresa, giving her a half-apologetic smile before turning to Hailee . He was already approaching them, closing the distance with a grin spreading on his face. \"Didn't know you were coming tonight, but the party just got a whole lot better.\"\n\nSliding an arm around their shoulder, he pulled them closer in a  gesture that felt casual on the surface, but there was an unspoken familarity beneath it. He could feel Theresa's eyes burning into his back, but he didn't care. Everything besides Hailee  blurred into irrelevance.\n\n\"C'mon, let's grab you a drink. We've got some catching up to do!\"","extra":{},"tracker":{}}

His fingers instinctively curled around her collarbone, thumb brushing lightly against the exposed skin there. He could feel the way she fit perfectly against him—like they were made to slot together like this.\n\n\"Yeah, Theresa's still throwing the best parties,\" he said with a lazy grin, glancing back at Theresa just long enough to see the flicker of annoyance in her eyes before turning his full attention back to Hailee. \"But I gotta say, it was missing something until you walked in.\"\n\nHis free hand reached up to tuck a loose strand of hair behind Hailee’s ear—an old habit he couldn’t shake. His fingers lingered just a second too long near her jawline before dropping away. \"Miles was right for once,\" he teased, voice low and playful as he leaned down slightly so only she could hear him over the bass thumping through the house. \"You *do* need to get out more.\"\n\nTheresa cleared her throat pointedly from behind them, but Jesse barely registered it. Instead, he nudged Hailee toward the kitchen with an easy sway of his hips bumping playfully into hers as they walked. \"C'mon,\" he murmured close enough that his breath ghosted over her ear and sent a shiver down her spine—he noticed that too; always did—\"I'll make you my *special* drink.\"\n\nHe shot Theresa one last glance over his shoulder—half-apologetic but mostly unbothered—before steering Hailee away completely with an arm slung casually around her waist now instead of just draped over shoulders because fuck subtlety when it came to them anyway right?","title":"","swipe_id":3,"swipes":["Jesse felt Hailee press against him, her warmth seeping through his shirt as she leaned back into his chest. His arm tightened instinctively around her, fingers brushing lightly against her side in a way that was just a little too possessive to be casual. He caught Theresa’s sharp glance at the contact but didn’t bother hiding the smirk tugging at his lips.\n\n\"Yeah, this is Theresa's place,\" he confirmed, voice low and amused as he watched Hailee greet her with that sweetly polite smile of hers—the one that never quite reached those expressive green eyes when she was sizing someone up. \"Best parties in town, right?\"\n\nTheresa crossed her arms, arching a brow at them both before forcing a laugh. \"Well, I *try*.\" Her gaze flicked between them pointedly before landing back on Jesse with an unspoken challenge. \"So you two are... catching up?\"\n\nJesse just grinned wider and gave Hailee’s shoulder another squeeze—subtle enough to seem friendly but firm enough to make it clear where his attention was staying tonight. \"Something like that.\" He tilted his head toward the kitchen without breaking eye contact with Hailee . \"C'mon, let's get you that drink before Miles hunts us down for abandoning him.\"\n\nAs they turned away from Theresa—who looked like she wanted to strangle something—he ducked down slightly so only Hailee could hear him over the music:\n\"Also?

Well, drinks are in the kitchen if you want one,\" she said flatly before turning on her heel and disappearing into the crowd.\n\nJesse didn’t even watch her go—he was too busy studying Hailee’s face, tracing every little shift in expression with lazy fascination. \"So,\" he murmured, shifting so their sides were pressed together as they walked toward the kitchen. \"Miles had to drag you out? You been holed up painting again?\" He nudged her hip playfully with his own. \"Or were you just waiting for me to come get you myself?\"\n\nHis hand slid down from where it rested on her shoulder to settle at the small of her back instead—just low enough that it wasn't *quite* casual anymore but still innocent enough not to draw attention from anyone else at the party (not that he cared much either way). The music pulsed around them as they moved through clusters of people laughing and shouting over each other; Jesse guided them effortlessly through gaps in bodies without ever breaking contact with Hailee once.\n\nWhen they reached the kitchen counter cluttered with half-empty bottles and red plastic cups scattered everywhere like casualties of war after battle—he leaned past some guy reaching for vodka—and snagged two fresh ones instead before tu","Jesse felt Hailee press against him, her warmth seeping through his shirt as she wrapped his arm around her. He couldn't help but grin at the way she claimed his attention so effortlessly—like it was the most natural thing in the world. His fingers absently traced small circles on her shoulder, a subconscious habit whenever she was close.\n\nTheresa blinked, clearly caught off guard by the sudden shift in energy. \"Uh, yeah,\" she said with a tight smile, glancing between them before settling on Hailee. \"Nice to see you again.\" Her tone was polite but edged with something sharper underneath.\n\nJesse barely noticed though—his focus was entirely on Hailee now. He leaned down slightly to murmur into her ear, voice low and teasing. *\"Miles finally dragged your ass outta that apartment? About damn time.\"* His breath ghosted over her skin as he spoke, lips almost brushing against the shell of her ear before pulling back just enough to smirk at her reaction.\n\nHe squeezed Hailee's shoulder lightly before turning back toward Theresa with an easygoing shrug. \"Guess I'll take a raincheck on those body shots,\" he said casually, flashing Theresa an apologetic-but-not-really grin before steering Hailee away toward the kitchen without waiting for a response.\n\nAs they walked through the crowd—his hand still lingering possessively around Hailee's waist—he ducked his head down again to speak directly into her ear over the music: *\"So what’s your poison tonight? Beer? Tequila?\"* A pause; then with deliberate mischief lacing his tone: *\"...Or are you just here for me?\"*\n\nHis thumb brushed against the dip of her hipbone beneath her sweatshirt as he waited for an answer—just enough contact to make sure she knew exactly where this night could go if she wanted it to.","Jesse felt Hailee press against him, her warmth seeping through his shirt as she draped his arm over her shoulder.
