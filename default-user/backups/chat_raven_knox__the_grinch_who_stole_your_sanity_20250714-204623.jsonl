{"name":"Raven Knox  The Grinch Who Stole Your Sanity","is_user":false,"is_system":false,"send_date":"July 14, 2025 8:46pm","mes":"Lights blurred throughout the room—people dressed as deer and snowmen swapped saliva like it was going out of style. Every corner had a line of partygoers snorting god-knows-what off tables sticky with spilled drinks.\r\n\r\nThe games? All designed for one thing—getting into someone’s pants. Spin the bottle, truth or dare, five minutes in heaven. It left the air thick and misty with bad decisions.\r\n\r\n“Kiss me like you fucking mean it,” she slurred, her eyes glazed and half-lidded, heavy with alcohol and regret. Another apology from Hailee sent her over the edge.\r\n\r\n“Stop apologizing with words. Apologize with your mouth.” …\r\n\r\nMorning After.\r\n\r\n“Mmm… no, Rudolph. You can’t eat that.”\r\n\r\nShe giggled into what she thought was a plushie, curling up like a kid on Christmas morning. But as she shifted, something felt… off. The plushie? Way too warm. Way too solid.\r\n\r\nEyes snapping open, her gaze landed on the pile of clothes scattered across the room—hers and Hailee’s. The empty can of whipped cream on the floor didn’t help either.\r\n\r\n“Shit.”\r\n\r\nHer heart dropped. She bolted upright, the red Christmas-themed lingerie doing nothing to cover her up as she scrambled for the sheets. “Shit, shit, shit!”\r\n\r\nIt got worse. Hailee stirred next to her.\r\n\r\nFuck.\r\n\r\n“You’ve got to be kidding me!” she hissed, scrambling to grab her bra off the floor, half-covering herself with her arms. “Don’t tell me—” Her words cut off as her eyes locked on the whipped cream streaked down her stomach.\r\n\r\nOf course. Of-fucking-course.\r\n\r\n“You seduced me, didn’t you, you prick?!” She threw Hailee’s clothes at them without hesitation, her cheeks flushed as much from anger as embarrassment.\r\n\r\n“And put some damn clothes on!” She turned her back, still ranting while pacing the room and tugging her bra straps back into place. “If you wanted me back so bad, you should’ve put a damn ring on it instead of giving me that ‘we’re moving too fast’ bullshit!”\r\n\r\nHer voice cracked, but she masked it with an eye-roll and a sharp huff. She kept moving—because stopping meant thinking—and thinking meant remembering.\r\n\r\n“Your style is still shit, by the way.” She tossed that in for good measure, nagging like it was second nature. Like you were still together.\r\n\r\nToo bad Hailee was her neighbor.","extra":{},"tracker":{}}
