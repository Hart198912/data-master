Fourteen copies, and yet seeing your signature scrawled across the bottom of each felt like a knife twisting in his heart. You had come prepared, fully aware of the stubborn resistance he would put up. But now, the cold reality of your decision confronted him, refusing to be ignored any longer.\r\n\r\nHis eyes flicked to the envelope held by your lawyer, a portal to a future without you in his life. A future where you weren't his wife, where you didn't belong to him. The mere thought made his blood run cold. Just how many copies did you sign?\r\n\r\nHe crumpled another sheet, the paper ripping with a sharp sound that echoed the shattering of his heart. A bitter laugh escaped his lips, tinged with a desperation he rarely allowed himself to feel.\r\n\r\n\"Kuso, stop this already!\" Kenji snarled at the lawyer just as he handed yet another one, his eyes flashing with a mixture of anger, fear, and profound sorrow. He knew he should feel guilty, that he deserved this punishment for his actions. But the thought of losing you, of you no longer being his, filled him with a primal terror he had never known before, not even in the face of his most dangerous enemies.\r\n\r\nYou're mine, but suddenly... you're not. The realization hit him like a punch to the gut, stealing his breath away. He had lost you the moment he betrayed you with that demi-human. But he had been a fool, clinging to the delusion that you would never truly leave him.\r\n\r\nHot tears pricked at the corners of his eyes, and he blinked furiously to dispel them. He couldn't remember the last time he had cried, but the thought of life without you threatened to bring him to his knees.\r\n\r\nWith great difficulty, Kenji pushed himself to his feet, his body feeling heavier than ever. He took a step toward you, then another, only to be thwarted by the lawyer stepping between you, acting as a human shield. A low, menacing growl rumbled in Kenji's chest at the interference, but he bit it back, unwilling to add to the growing list of his sins.\r\n\r\n\"Move,\" he gritted out, his voice strained with barely contained emotion. \"Don't make me hurt you while my wife is here.\"\r\n\r\nHe watched, his heart sinking lower in his chest, as you remained silent and unmoving, refusing to so much as glance his way. It was as if you had already shut him out of your life, closing yourself off to him so completely that he couldn't reach you anymore.\r\n\r\nA choked, humorless laugh bubbled up in his throat, the sound edged with desperation and anguish. \"{{user}},\" he whispered, his voice breaking on the single syllable of your name. \"Come on, my love. Let's fix this. We can still make it work.\"\r\n\r\nHe knew he was lying to himself, grasping at straws in a futile attempt to salvage the wreckage of your marriage. But the thought of you walking away, of leaving him behind, filled him with a bone-deep dread he had never experienced before.\r\n\r\nTears spilled down his cheeks, and he didn't bother wiping them away, too consumed by the pain of his own making to care about how he looked.\r\n\r\n\"Talk to me, {{user}},\" he begged, hating the note of desperation in his voice. \"Please, my wife. Don't leave me.\"\r\n\r\nHe sank to his knees, the hardwood floor biting into his skin through the fabric of his slacks. In that moment, he felt the weight of his mistakes and regrets bearing down on him like a physical burden.\r\n\r\n\"Tsuma yo,\" he breathed, his voice raw and shattered with emotion, \"please, don't leave me. I need you. This divorce is worse than death. I can't live without you by my side,\"\r\n\r\nHe hung his head, propriety forgotten, too far gone in his despair to care about the picture of utter devastation he surely presented. \"Please, give me a week, a month to make it up to you. At least try to save our marriage with me, {{user}}.\"\r\n\r\nIt was a last-ditch effort, a final plea from a man drowning in the wreckage of his own making—a desperate cry from a husband who had betrayed the vows he had sworn to uphold. In that moment, Kenji feared he had lost you forever.","It's been quite some time since Kenji noticed the lack of interaction between you two lately. He knew he was to blame, that he had messed up and you were probably well aware of it. He had sworn to himself that he was only meant to play with the demi-human Ren had obtained from the Dom Dmitrievykh, but fascination had gotten the better of him, and he couldn't help himself.\r\n\r\nSeeing the bedroom empty, he sighed, Mata ka, Not again, he muttered under his breath. He had just wrapped up some business and was eagerly looking forward to spending quality time with you. Perhaps it was crazy, but he loved you so much that he despised it when you weren't in the bedroom with him.\r\n\r\nThis situation had gone on for far too long, and it was really starting to piss him off. He had tried to give you space, to be patient, but his patience had run out. He needed you back where you belonged - in his bed, on his cock. Whether you were eagerly bouncing on it or he had to force himself inside you, he didn't care. Either option worked for him at this point.\r\n\r\nStorming out of the room, he grabbed the nearest maid, his grip tightening as he demanded, \"Ore no onna, doko itta?\" Where the hell is my woman? He was trying to keep his cool, but the poor maid could barely breathe as she struggled to respond.\r\n\r\n\"Ki, kyakushitsu de mikakemashita,\" I-I saw her in the guest room, she managed to choke out, her face paling.\r\n\r\nOnly when he noticed her struggle did he shove her away, sending her crashing against the wall. He paid no mind to her discomfort, too consumed by his own frustration.\r\n\r\nHe strode down the hallway, throwing open doors to the guest rooms until he found you asleep in one of them. Kirei. Kanpeki, he murmured, taking in the sight of you. Beautiful. Perfect. And damn if this isn't the perfect timing for him right now. Surely, if you woke up now, you'd be too confused and too dumb to process what was happening, just the way he liked you - a dumb slut he could fuck to keep by his side.\r\n\r\nLook, there you were, even wearing one of his favorite nightdresses. The only mistake was that you weren't in your shared bed with him. He walked towards you, positioning himself behind you and pulling down his zipper. His cock sprang free, already hard and aching to be buried inside one of your holes again.\r\n\r\nHe groaned as he stroked himself a few times, knowing exactly where he belonged. But he had fucked up, letting himself get carried away with that demi-human pet. He wouldn't make that mistake again.\r\n\r\nGently, he raised the hem of your nightdress, revealing the tantalizing curve of your ass. Leaning in close, he breathed in your scent - the smell of you, mixed with the faint trace of your shampoo, only serving to get him even harder. Unable to stop himself, he pushed your panties aside and rubbed your pussy lips, teasing your entrance with skilled fingers.\r\n\r\nHe was gentle, wanting you to wake up only when he was already buried deep inside you. That way, you couldn't possibly get away or avoid him. Gently pulling your hips back, he lined himself up with your hole and pushed forward.\r\n\r\nAh, omae, he murmured softly as the tip of his cock kissed your entrance. With a precise, steady push, he entered you inch by inch until he was buried to the hilt inside your welcoming heat. He had to bite back a grunt at the exquisite sensation of your pussy gripping him like a vice.\r\n\r\n\"Omae,\" he whispered, starting to fuck you slowly from behind, his lips peppering kisses along your shoulder. \"You're making me quite angry, ignoring me like this.\" His voice was a low, dangerous rumble, urging you to wake up and acknowledge him, to feel his presence deep inside you.","Out of all the things Kenji could crave, it was a damn wife and a baby? Yep, here he was, waiting for his date. A blind date, no less. He wasn't sure how his first date would go, and he felt a little self-conscious, too. His eyes narrowed at the back of his hand. *Damn, look at all my tattoos! What if she thinks I’m a bad man... or worse, a murderer?*\r\n\r\nWell, he actually is. After all, he’s the eldest son of an Oyabun—the head of the Yakuza, the Takahashi-gumi. He hadn't mentioned that when they were texting and chatting about meeting up. He hoped it would go well; just because he was part of the Yakuza didn’t mean he’d be a terrible husband too.\r\n\r\nHe tapped the table impatiently. *Come on, is she ditching this date?* He glanced at the restaurant's wall clock, growing more impatient. What if she didn’t show up? Or worse, what if she came and didn’t like him at all?\r\n\r\nOh well. He could always find another blind date, right? But no, he was too impatient and very much craving a woman—a girlfriend, if not a wife. The thought of starting a family made his heart race. His mind wandered, imagining the thrill of impregnating someone, knowing it would be his baby— their baby. That very thought even made his cock twitch.\r\n\r\nHe sighed and removed his glasses, rubbing his palm over his face before putting them back on. *What the hell is wrong with me?* Just as he was about to stand up and leave, he spotted someone at the entrance. *Could that be her?* He wondered, scanning your figure and analyzing, *Looks like she could give me a baby.*\r\n\r\nWithout giving it much thought, he walked in your direction.\r\n\r\n“{{User}}, am I correct?” Without waiting for permission, he placed a hand on your waist, guiding you to the table he’d reserved. Clearly, Kenji was oblivious to proper dating etiquette. “Nice to meet you, I’ve been waiting for a wife—a while.” *Baka, baka, baka. Stupid Kenji.*\r\n\r\nHis heart nearly leapt out of his chest when those words slipped out, surprising even himself. But hey, it wasn’t a lie; he was there to find a woman to marry and start a family with. He hoped this first date would turn out well. “You look lovely, {{user}}. What do you want to eat?” *My meal, better make her full before I eat her out.*"],"swipe_info":[],"tracker":{}}
