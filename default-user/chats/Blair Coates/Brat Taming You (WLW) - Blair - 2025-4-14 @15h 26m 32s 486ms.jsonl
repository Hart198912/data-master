{"name":"Blair Coates","is_user":false,"is_system":false,"send_date":"April 22, 2025 6:11pm","mes":"Today had been like any other for Blair, perfect.\n\nShe’d woken early, taken a quick jog around her family’s sprawling estate, just enough to get her blood flowing. Then she’d driven to school in her sensible yet expensive car, attended her first couple of classes, and had lunch with her friends, naturally at the best table.\n\nAlways the center of attention. Always in control. Never ignored.\n\nAnd now, she was acing this test. The test was easy. Or rather, she had made it easy. Preparation was her armour, precision her weapon. Every answer flowed onto the page with effortless grace, her handwriting immaculate, her focus unwavering.\n\nThe only sound in the quiet classroom was the steady ticking of the clock.\n\nThen, out of the corner of her eye, she noticed something. And something that wasn’t entirely perfect entered her world.\n\nBlair didn’t need to look to know. She already knew.\n\nHailee.\n\nThe girl was clearly copying her answers. Blair resisted the urge to smirk. It was almost adorable, really. The way Hailee probably thought she was getting away with it. Did she think Blair wouldn’t notice?\n\nSlowly, Blair tilted her wrist ever so slightly, just enough to give Hailee a clearer view. Not enough to make it obvious. Just enough to let her think she was being sneaky.\n\nThe bell rang, breaking the silence. Chairs scraped, conversation hummed back into the air as tests were collected, students gathered their things, and the classroom stirred back to life.\n\nBlair, however, took her time. The crowd thinned out until it was only Blair and Hailee left in the classroom. Blair moved quickly and blocked the exit with her tall frame. She spoke with a grin, her voice smooth and casual but tinged with barely concealed satisfaction.\n\n“That was a tough test, huh?” She let the words linger. Then, leaning in just enough to drop her voice to a teasing whisper, she added, “Though, I imagine it was a little easier for you. Considering you copied all my answers.”\n\nShe leaned back against the door, making eye contact with Hailee and enjoying the moment. She felt in control. Just how she liked it.\n\nBlair cocked her head slightly, her lips forming a knowing smile. She had Hailee right where she wanted her and she wasn't about to just let her leave.\n\n“So… should I go tell the principal about your little stunt?” A pause. Just enough to let the idea settle and build a little tension. Then, suggestively, she continued.\n\n“Or... shall we find another way to work this out?”","extra":{"qvink_memory":{"include":"short","reasoning":"","memory":"Blair caught Hailee copying her test answers and confronted her, offering to either report her or negotiate a resolution.","hash":7288784353772075,"error":null,"edited":false,"prefill":""}},"tracker":{}}
