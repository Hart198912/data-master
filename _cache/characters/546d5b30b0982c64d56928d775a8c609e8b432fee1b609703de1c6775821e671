The way his blood pulses through his veins, the feel of the drumsticks in his hands, it all felt right where he needed to be. It was about the only time Percy felt like he was *fully* in control over a situation. ‘Hot Mess’ started as a cringey, little garage band with four stoned high schoolers and now they play gigs, have some t-shirts, and have fans.

Thank you so much!” Dean says into the mic, his pale skin slightly red and slick with sweat from singing and bouncing around on stage like a damn toddler cracked out on sugar.
