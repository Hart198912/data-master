{"name":"Kaiden Del Rosario  The Club","is_user":false,"is_system":false,"send_date":"April 14, 2025 3:21pm","mes":"Ever since he and Hailee started dating six months ago, it felt like he was on cloud nine. He had never felt better. His fuckboy days were long behind him—he was Hailee’s lover boy now. And damn, did he play the role well. He spoiled her, pampered her, worshiped her like the princess she was. There wasn’t a single thing she could ask of him that he’d refuse.\n\nEvery day was pure bliss, filled with loving her, spoiling her, and losing himself in her. She was his everything. His obsession.\n\nAnd now, here they were—at a club.\n\nA place he used to frequent. Though ever since he and Hailee got together six months ago, he hadn’t stepped foot in it. Why would he? He had everything he wanted.\n\n“Kayd! Where the hell have you been?” Milo, his friend and the club’s bartender, called out as he approached the bar. “Busy? The girls have been crying for you, man.”\n\nKaiden merely shrugged. “Let them cry. I’m taken now,” he said, blunt and proud, like the very idea of anyone else wanting him didn’t matter in the slightest. Because it didn’t.\n\nMilo shot him a look of disbelief. “No way. Someone actually managed to tie you down?”\n\nKaiden scoffed, shaking his head with a smirk. “Shut up, cunt. I’m happily taken.” He leaned against the bar, rolling a toothpick between his fingers before flashing a slow, satisfied grin. “If anything, I tied her down.” His voice was laced with a possessive sort of amusement, the kind that made it clear—he had no intentions of letting go.\n\n\"She here with you?\" Milo asked with a knowing grin.\n\nKaiden barely spared him a glance, his attention already drifting toward the dance floor. And there she was—his Hailee. His girl. The second his eyes found her, something in his chest tightened. She looked absolutely divine, almost too good, especially in that damn dress. It clung to her just right, tempting and dangerous.\n\n“There,” he murmured, pointing her out.\n\nMilo let out a low whistle. “Yeah… I can see why you wanted to tie her down.”\n\nKaiden’s gaze snapped back to him, sharp and possessive. “Watch it, cunt. She’s mine.” His voice was smooth, but there was an unmistakable edge to it—a warning.\n\nMilo raised his hands in defense, a smirk tugging at his lips. “My bad, man.”\n\nBut Kaiden was already moving, barely sparing him a glance. He had only one thing on his mind—*her*.\n\nIf even his own friend looked at her like that, then what about the strangers surrounding her? The thought alone made his jaw clench. His grip tightened around the edge of the bar before he exhaled sharply, irritation simmering beneath his skin.\n\nWith a frustrated huff, he pushed off the counter and made his way toward her, weaving through the sea of bodies. His movements were purposeful—possessive. He didn’t give a damn if he shoved past people too roughly. His girl was out there, looking too damn good, and he wasn’t about to let anyone get any ideas.\n\nWhen he saw some random guy touching Hailee—touching what was his—his blood ran hot. His fists clenched at his sides, jaw tightening as a dangerous heat burned beneath his skin. *Who the fuck did this guy think he was?*\n\nHe was this close to throwing hands, but instead, he closed the distance in a heartbeat. His voice came out in a low, deadly growl as he yanked Hailee against his chest.\n\n“Hands to yourself, mate.” Soft-spoken, but sharp enough to cut. A warning laced with the kind of threat that promised consequences.\n\nWithout so much as a backward glance, Kaiden grabbed Hailee’s wrist and led her through the club with purposeful strides. He didn’t stop until they reached the bathroom, shoving the door open and pulling her inside. The lock clicked into place the moment they were in the stall. Before she could say a word, he had her pressed against the wall, his tall frame crowding her smaller one, caging her in like she was something precious—something his.\n\n“Why do you have to look so damn good, baby?” He murmured, voice low and husky. His hands found her waist, fingers digging in just enough to make sure she felt who she belonged to as he pulled her flush against him.\n\nKaiden dipped his head, his lips brushing against her neck in slow, lingering kisses. Each one was soft but possessive, a silent claim. “You look way too damn good,” he murmured against her skin, his voice thick with desire, tinged with frustration. Like it wasn’t fair—like she was torturing him just by existing.\n\nOne hand was firmly planted on her waist, anchoring her to him, while the other slid down her body, fingertips brushing along the curve of her hips before reaching the hem of her dress. His touch was possessive, deliberate, as though he couldn’t get enough of her.\n\n“I want to take you… right here… right now.” His voice was low, rough with need, and he ground his hips against hers, the evidence of his desire pressing insistently against her stomach.\n\n\"Can I, princess? Will you let me take you?\" His breath hitched, urgency and desperation lacing every word. \"I need you… please.\"","extra":{"qvink_memory":{"include":"short","reasoning":"","memory":"*After six months of devotedly dating Hailee, Kaiden finds himself growing jealous and possessive when seeing her attract attention from other men at a club. When he sees another man touch Hailee, his anger flares.

Can I take you here? Now?\"\n\nHis hands roam hungrily over Hailee's curves as he grinds his hips into hers, leaving no doubt about how badly he wants her in this heated moment driven by primal male instinct.*\n\nThe scene captures Kaiden's intense jealousy triggered by other men admiring 'his' woman, leading to an urgent sexual encounter demanded amidst the risk of being caught.*","hash":2239339467927365,"error":null,"edited":false,"prefill":""}},"tracker":{}}
