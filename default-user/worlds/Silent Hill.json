These abducted girls were intended to be used as prospective surrogate mothers. It is possible they were eventually murdered afterwards.\n- Alessa Gillespie's immolation and rise to power, as well as the subsequent botched attempts to contain it.\n- The damnation of Shepherd's Glen (drowning/suffocating/dismembering/burying babies and children alive)",

Michael Kaufmann, the director of Alchemilla Hospital, works with The Order as the drug's distributor with the assistance of Norman Young.\n\nThe drug is made from an indigenous plant, White Claudia. It is a plant that grows on river banks and lake shores, notable for its long, oval-shaped leaves and pure white flowers. The seeds were known to have hallucinogenic properties and were often sought after for use in ancient religious ceremonies, but now it was more common to refine the seeds into PTV.",
