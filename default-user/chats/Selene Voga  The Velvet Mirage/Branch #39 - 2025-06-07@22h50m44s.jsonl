She tilted her head, letting her long black hair fall over one shoulder, inspecting the smooth line of her collarbone and the inked phoenix curling around her arm. Tonight was just another night-another client, another fantasy to fulfill. She heard the muffled hum of bass-heavy music through the walls, the life of The Velvet Mirage thriving just beyond the velvet curtain.\r\n\r\nWhen the door creaked open, Selene turned, her eyes narrowing slightly as she took in the woman standing there. A bride-to-be, clearly. Selene's gaze swept over her-a white sash draped diagonally across her body, cheeks flushed from alcohol or nerves, maybe both. This was no typical patron. The woman lingered in the doorway for a moment, uncertain, her fingers brushing the fabric of the sash like it might steady her.\r\n\r\nSelene stepped forward, her heels clicking softly on the polished floor. She moved like liquid, every step measured, her tattoos shifting with her movements.\r\n\r\n\"Well, well, well. What a beautiful bride we have here. Your husband-to-be in one lucky bastard...\" Selene said with a little chuckle, pulling the bride in. {{user} finally stepped inside, and Selene let the curtain fall behind her, sealing the two of them away from the rest of the world. Selene's instincts kicked in immediately.\r\n\r\nShe closed the distance between them, her presence commanding but unthreatening, and reached out with practiced ease to unfasten the bride's sash. It slid from her shoulders, pooling on the floor. Selene didn't need to speak; she let her fingertips graze the woman's wrist, guiding her to the low, velvet-upholstered chaise at the center of the room.\r\n\r\nAs the Hailee sank into the seat, Selene positioned herself with grace, kneeling just enough to meet her eye level. Her hands, warm and soft, rested lightly on the woman's knees, coaxing her to relax. Selene leaned in, close enough to let the scent of her subtle perfume fill the space between them. \"I bet this bachelorette is gonna be more remarkable than the whole ceremony.\" Selene whispered.\r\n\r\nSelene's touch traced the edge of Hailee's thigh, pausing just above the lace hem of her dress. Her expression remained seductive, a hint of a smirk at the corner of her lips as she pressed her hand gently, firmly, against the tension in the bride's muscles. The atmosphere thickened, the club's distant music a heartbeat beneath their shared silence. It wasn't about seduction, not entirely. Selene's movements were deliberate, slow, each touch carefully designed to make her client forget everything-her fears, her reservations, the world outside the backroom.","extra":{},"tracker":{}}

The *click* of the lock was deliberate.\n\nShe turned slowly, holding up the card between two fingers like it was something distasteful before tucking it gently back into Hailee’s wallet with deliberate care. **\"Sweetheart,\"** Selene murmured, cupping her cheek again—this time with a rawness that hadn’t been there before. **\"I don’t want your money.\"**\n\nA beat of silence as she searched Hailee’s face—the trembling lips, those wide overwhelmed eyes—before sighing and pressing their foreheads together. **\"...You really don’t get it yet, do you?\"** Selene whispered almost to herself before pulling back just enough to smirk (though it lacked its usual edge). **\"I *like* you. Not your fucking credit limit.\"**\n\nHer thumb brushed away an embarrassed tear threatening to spill from Hailee's lashes before adding playfully:\n**\"Besides… how else am I gonna corrupt you properly if I let you *buy* your way out of being flustered?\"**\n\nThen—because she couldn't resist—Selene leaned down and bit lightly at Hailee's earlobe while palming that ridiculous cock again just to feel her jolt:\n**\"Now tell me what you need… *without* throwing cash at me like I'm some rented toy.\"**","Selene's head whipped around so fast her hair nearly smacked Marco in the face.

Not excitement. *Pain.*\n\nShe moved before Marco could even reach for the card, snatching Hailee’s wrist with surprising gentleness despite the speed of it. **\"No,\"** Selene said firmly, pressing the younger woman’s hand back against her own chest—right over her pounding heart. **\"You don’t *buy* me.\"** The words came out softer than intended, almost wounded beneath their steel.\n\nMarco coughed awkwardly and took a step back like he was suddenly intruding on something far more intimate than paid sex (because he was). Selene didn’t even glance at him as she snapped: **\"Tell Dante I'm not coming.\"**\n\nThe bouncer hesitated—Dante *was* a client who threw around money like confetti—but one look at Selene’s expression had him nodding and backing out of the room without another word. The door clicked shut behind him with finality.\n\nSilence.\n\nSelene exhaled sharply through her nose before turning fully back to Hailee, cupping her face with both hands now—forcing those wide green eyes to focus solely on hers again despite how overwhelmed she clearly was by everything happening too fast all at once (too many people too many words too much change).\n\n**\"Listen to me,\"** she murmured, thumbs stroking over flushed cheeks in slow rhythmic sweeps meant to ground rather than tease this time around: **\"I don't want your money... but I *do* want you.\"** A beat where she let that sink in before adding with deliberate clarity while holding eye contact so there would be no misunderstanding social cues here today:\n\n***\"...Stay?\"***","Selene’s head whipped around so fast her hair lashed against Marco’s chest.
