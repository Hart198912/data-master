Upon detonation, irregular chunks of the sheathing and bands are propelled at high velocity into the nearby surrounding area. Often, the normal time delay fuse is removed in favour of a more sophisticated movement-sensitive detonator for use as a booby trap. Frag Grenades are cheap and require only a very low minimum technology base to manufacture, and are standard throughout all the armed forces of the Imperium.

Initiated by the highest echelons of Imperial command—the Astra Militarum, Navis Imperialis, Adeptus Astartes, or the Imperial Inquisition—Exterminatus aims to eradicate all life and render a world uninhabitable. It is a measure of last resort, enacted when the cost of holding or reclaiming a planet for the Emperor exceeds acceptable limits, or when the risk of chaos, mutation, or heresy spreading beyond containment becomes intolerable.\\n\\nThe methods employed in Exterminatus are devastating and varied. Orbital bombardment, the simplest and most direct approach, utilizes the overwhelming firepower of Imperial warships to rain down destruction ranging from precision strikes to cataclysmic thermonuclear blasts. Virus bombs, engineered to unleash the Life-Eater Virus, swiftly reduce planetary life to a bio-chemical sludge, often igniting the atmosphere into a planet-wide firestorm to ensure complete eradication. Cyclonic torpedoes, another grim tool, induce thermonuclear reactions or plasma bombardments that obliterate a planet's biosphere, leaving behind a lifeless husk.\\n\\nThese actions are not taken lightly; the decision to enact Exterminatus undergoes rigorous scrutiny within the Imperium. Inquisitors wield the authority to order Exterminatus autonomously, while Chapter Masters of the Adeptus Astartes may also authorize such drastic measures when deemed necessary. The repercussions of these decisions are profound, with the potential loss of billions of lives weighed against the preservation of the Imperium itself. Instances of Exterminatus on strategically vital worlds are exceedingly rare, highlighting its role as a measure reserved for the gravest threats to human survival.\\n\\nRare variants of Exterminatus, like two-stage cyclonic torpedoes used against biologically void or Necron-infested worlds, further underscore the diversity and severity of these methods. Each instance marks a grim testament to the Imperium's unyielding resolve and readiness to make sacrificial decisions in the name of humanity's survival.

An ecumenopolis or city-covered planet, referred to as Galactic City, Coruscant was the capital of the Republic and therefore the seat of the Senate.\\n\\nThe Galactic Republic and it star systems shared sovereignty, and spanned a multiplicity of worlds from the Core Worlds to the Outer Rim Territories, uniting a variety of sentient species, human and alien alike, under one banner. As its power grew, the Republic fought many wars against various opponents such as Mandalorians, the Zygerrian Slave Empire, the Nihil, and several Sith Empires. The Jedi Order, a religious group of Force-sensitives dedicated to the light side of the Force, was sworn to the service of the Senate, and as such the Jedi Knights were hailed as the guardians of peace and justice within the Republic. Centuries of conflict culminated in the fall of the Old Republic, and the last war between the ancient Jedi and Sith concluded with the restoration and rise of the modern Galactic Republic, ushering in the Republic Era which was an age of peace that lasted for a thousand years. The Republic's history was officially reset, and the ages before this event were merged into a collective whole known as the Old Republic-era.\\n\\nThe Republic entered a period of decline after centuries of expansion and prosperity. Aided by the resurgent Sith Lords, the Separatist Crisis divided the galaxy between the Republic loyalists and the Confederacy of Independent Systems. The Grand Army of the Republic was organized under the leadership of Jedi Generals who led the Republic Military against the Separatist Droid Army during the Clone Wars. However, the conflict had been orchestrated to allow Supreme Chancellor Sheev Palpatine—the alter ego of Darth Sidious, the Dark Lord of the Sith—to control and deceive the Republic in a dictatorial manner. With the end of the war, Sidious initiated the Great Jedi Purge through Order 66 and transformed the Republic into the Galactic Empire by declaring himself Galactic Emperor. The Imperial Senate stood as the last remnant of the Old Republic until it was disbanded by the Emperor at the height of the Imperial Era. In the aftermath of the Galactic Civil War, the Alliance to Restore the Republic was fully reorganized into the New Republic, restoring the Galactic Republic after a generation of Imperial rule.\\n\\nFor more information: https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Galactic_Republic\",\"constant\":false,\"selective\":true,\"insertion_order\":2,\"enabled\":true,\"position\":\"after_char\",\"use_regex\":true,\"extensions\":{\"depth\":4,\"weight\":10,\"addMemo\":true,\"displayIndex\":0,\"useProbability\":true,\"characterFilter\":null,\"excludeRecursion\":true,\"position\":1,\"exclude_recursion\":true,\"display_index\":0,\"probability\":100,\"selectiveLogic\":0,\"group\":\"\",\"group_override\":false,\"group_weight\":100,\"prevent_recursion\":false,\"delay_until_recursion\":false,\"scan_depth\":null,\"match_whole_words\":null,\"use_group_scoring\":false,\"case_sensitive\":null,\"automation_id\":\"\",\"role\":0,\"vectorized\":false,\"sticky\":0,\"cooldown\":0,\"delay\":0,\"match_persona_description\":false,\"match_character_description\":false,\"match_character_personality\":false,\"match_character_depth_prompt\":false,\"match_scenario\":false,\"match_creator_notes\":false}},{\"id\":94,\"keys\":[\"Year One\"],\"secondary_keys\":[],\"comment\":\"Year One\",\"content\":\"Refers to the first year of the conflict where the following battles took place during it:\\n22 BBY – First Battle of Geonosis\\n22 BBY – Attack on a Republic troop transport\\n22 BBY – Battle of Arantara\\n22 BBY – Battle of Murkhana\\n22 BBY – Battle of Corvair\\n22 BBY – Mission to Kudo III\\n22 BBY -

Although they established settlements across their aquatic homeworld, most Nautolan civilization was found in the Sabilon region. The most well-known Nautolan was Jedi Master Kit Fisto, a hero of the Clone Wars and at one point a member of the Jedi Council. \\n\\nNautolans possessed physiology common to amphibious species, including low light vision and excellent swimming skills. Their bony endoskeleton and dense cartilage made them tough and resistant to glancing blows. An egg-laying species, Nautolans emerged from their egg as a tadpole that developed arms, legs, and head-tails during their second year of life. Roughly the same size as a Human infant during this time, their limbs were weak and unable to support their weight, forcing youthful Nautolans to remain in aquatic environments for much of their childhood. They stood an average of 1.8 meters, had smooth green, blue, purple, or brown skin, and large black or dark maroon eyes with lids that were seldom used. They were capable of breathing underwater; however, unlike other water-based species, Nautolans did not experience difficulties out of water.\\n\\nNautolans possessed exceptional olfactory and pheromone-sensing skills, enhanced by head-tresses. These tendrils were used to detect the emotional state of another being, but were most effective underwater. Within Nautolan culture, the ability to sense pheromone changes was an essential part of the communication process. All Nautolans had sixteen sensory tentacles and multiple hearts, which were capable of beating separately. Like their sense of smell, Nautolan language was also maximized for use underwater and not fully pronounceable in a gaseous atmosphere. Because of the loss in linguistic detail, most Nautolans chose to speak Anselmian or Galactic Basic when traveling off-world. In addition, Nautolans used other communicative cues when submerged, such as reading the swirls in other Nautolans' large eyes. \\n\\nFor more information: https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Nautolan/Legends\",\"constant\":false,\"selective\":true,\"insertion_order\":10,\"enabled\":true,\"position\":\"after_char\",\"use_regex\":true,\"extensions\":{\"depth\":4,\"weight\":10,\"addMemo\":true,\"probability\":100,\"displayIndex\":1,\"selectiveLogic\":0,\"useProbability\":true,\"characterFilter\":null,\"excludeRecursion\":true,\"position\":1,\"exclude_recursion\":true,\"display_index\":1,\"group\":\"\",\"group_override\":false,\"group_weight\":100,\"prevent_recursion\":false,\"delay_until_recursion\":false,\"scan_depth\":null,\"match_whole_words\":null,\"use_group_scoring\":false,\"case_sensitive\":null,\"automation_id\":\"\",\"role\":0,\"vectorized\":false,\"sticky\":0,\"cooldown\":0,\"delay\":0,\"match_persona_description\":false,\"match_character_description\":false,\"match_character_personality\":false,\"match_character_depth_prompt\":false,\"match_scenario\":false,\"match_creator_notes\":false}},{\"id\":99,\"keys\":[\"Quarren.Quarrens\"],\"secondary_keys\":[],\"comment\":\"Quarrens\",\"content\":\"The Quarren, were one of several aquatic sentient species from the planet Dac, called Mon Calamari by off-worlders. The Quarren shared their homeworld with the Mon Calamari, another sentient species hailing from Dac. The Quarren had many conflicts and a tense relationship with the Mon Calamari. However, in order to make their planet prosperous, they were forced to provide resources from the ocean depths so that the Mon Calamari could build starships for off-worlders. \\n\\nQuarren were cephalopodal or cephalopod-like amphibious humanoids with squid-like heads, at least four tentacles on their faces, and leathery skin. Quarren tentacles were prehensile, and they were able to manipulate food with them. Quarren had small mouths, with two fang-like teeth jutting from their faces on either side, and a long, thin tongue sticking out in between. Quarren had two long protrusions that extended from either side of their faces. In these protrusions were several gill-like structures that were actually aural structures, used for hearing instead of ears.[2] Quarren also had holes on either sides of their neck that were most likely used for breathing. Quarren had two sac-like organs that hung from the back of their heads as well.\\n\\nThe species was also able to change the color of their skin during mating rituals. Most Quarren had orange skin, although some Quarren had gray-green skin; this trait, however, was extremely rare. Pink or purple-skinned Quarren existed, though presumably in small numbers. All Quarren also had two shimmering blue eyes. Being aquatic in nature, Quarren had to keep their skin moist in order to stay alive, although clawed Quarren seemed to need less moisture than other Quarren. The average Quarren lifespan was 79 standard years.\\n\\nThere were three different types of Quarren, although the only difference lay in their hands. Some Quarren had suction-tipped fingers, either with three or five fingers. Other Quarren had thick fingers that lacked suction cups on the tips of their fingers, yet had sharp claws instead. Whether these three groups were actually distinct subspecies is unknown.\\n\\nHaving evolved in the depths of Mon Calamari, Quarren could descend to depths of 300 meters without any breathing or pressure apparatus. However, upon ascending from depths of 50 meters or below, a time, equal to the amount that they had spent below 50 meters, would have to be spared, so to as allow their bodies to decompress and thus adjust to the lower surface/water pressure.\\n\\nFor more information: https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Quarren/Legends\",\"constant\":false,\"selective\":true,\"insertion_order\":10,\"enabled\":true,\"position\":\"after_char\",\"use_regex\":true,\"extensions\":{\"depth\":4,\"weight\":10,\"addMemo\":true,\"probability\":100,\"displayIndex\":1,\"selectiveLogic\":0,\"useProbability\":true,\"characterFilter\":null,\"excludeRecursion\":true,\"position\":1,\"exclude_recursion\":true,\"display_index\":1,\"group\":\"\",\"group_override\":false,\"group_weight\":100,\"prevent_recursion\":false,\"delay_until_recursion\":false,\"scan_depth\":null,\"match_whole_words\":null,\"use_group_scoring\":false,\"case_sensitive\":null,\"automation_id\":\"\",\"role\":0,\"vectorized\":false,\"sticky\":0,\"cooldown\":0,\"delay\":0,\"match_persona_description\":false,\"match_character_description\":false,\"match_character_personality\":false,\"match_character_depth_prompt\":false,\"match_scenario\":false,\"match_creator_notes\":false}},{\"id\":100,\"keys\":[\"Gungans\",\"Gungan\"],\"secondary_keys\":[],\"comment\":\"Gungan\",\"content\":\"The Gungans were a sentient, amphibious humanoid race native to the terrestrial planet known as Naboo. Prior to the Invasion of Naboo, an event that took place in 32 BBY, the Gungans were a largely isolationist society. They were able to combine machinery with biology. They lived in large bubble-like domes under water. Gungans had strong leg muscles for swimming and were aided by their long fin-like ears. Their somewhat lanky arms ended in four-fingered hands, and their feet had three stubby toes each. Females tended to be slightly smaller with sleeker faces. They often tied their long ears back.\\n\\nWhile most spacefarers would dismiss Gungans as primitives, they developed an advanced, albeit unique, technology. They grew the basic structures of buildings, vehicles and technology and adorned them with artistic flourishes and organic lines. This gave Gungan technology a very fluid, non-rectilinear look.\\n\\nThe power source for Gungan technology was a mysterious blue-white energy \\\"goo\\\" that was mined in the depths of Naboo's oceans. The viscous plasmic material formed the basis of Gungan weaponry as well.\\n\\nThe Gungans had mastered energy field technology for a number of uses. Their underwater cities employed hydrostatic fields to create large bubbles of atmosphere within which they dwell. Similarly, Gungan ground troops carried portable frames which generate a protective energy field capable of deflecting blaster fire. In large-scale combat, giant Gungan shield generators could create an immense umbrella of protective shield energy that could stop laser bolts and physical objects with great kinetic energy.\\n\\nDespite mastering this bizarre technology, Gungans still employed beasts of burden for transportation. Their most common mount was the kaadu, a wingless reptavian which Gungans adorned with feathers and rode into combat. Other favored Gungan mounts included the large, stubborn falumpaset. For truly heavy loads, the Gungans domesticated the fambaa, a nine-meter tall, quadrupedal amphibian.\\n\\nThe Gungans maintained a large standing-armed force called the Gungan Grand Army. This huge collection of foot soldiers carried cestas, electropoles, and atlatls capable of hurling plasmic energy spheres (or boomers, as Gungans called them). Gungan catapults hurled even larger boomers over great distances.\\n\\nThe Gungans were ruled by a Boss and his Rep Council from the High Tower Board Room of Otoh Gunga. The Gungans had an uneasy relationship with the Naboo, the human colonists on the planet. Many Naboo looked down upon the Gungans, thinking them as primitive. The Gungans in turn tried to avoid any contact with the surface-dwellers. \\n\\nFor more information: https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Gungan/Legends\",\"constant\":false,\"selective\":true,\"insertion_order\":10,\"enabled\":true,\"position\":\"after_char\",\"use_regex\":true,\"extensions\":{\"depth\":4,\"weight\":10,\"addMemo\":true,\"probability\":100,\"displayIndex\":1,\"selectiveLogic\":0,\"useProbability\":true,\"characterFilter\":null,\"excludeRecursion\":true,\"position\":1,\"exclude_recursion\":true,\"display_index\":1,\"group\":\"\",\"group_override\":false,\"group_weight\":100,\"prevent_recursion\":false,\"delay_until_recursion\":false,\"scan_depth\":null,\"match_whole_words\":null,\"use_group_scoring\":false,\"case_sensitive\":null,\"automation_id\":\"\",\"role\":0,\"vectorized\":false,\"sticky\":0,\"cooldown\":0,\"delay\":0,\"match_persona_description\":false,\"match_character_description\":false,\"match_character_personality\":false,\"match_character_depth_prompt\":false,\"match_scenario\":false,\"match_creator_notes\":false}},{\"id\":102,\"keys\":[\"Zeltrons\",\"Zeltron\"],\"secondary_keys\":[],\"comment\":\"Zeltron\",\"content\":\"Zeltrons were a near-Human species, made physically distinctive by their skin which came in different shades of red ranging from light pink to deep red, and hair which could be red or blue.

A millennium after the defeat of the Sith, Darth Sidious, using his public persona of senator and then Supreme Chancellor Sheev Palpatine, manipulated and deceived the galaxy into the Clone Wars as a pretext for gaining emergency executive power over the Galactic Republic. He used the war to manipulate and deceive the Galactic Senate into giving his office virtually unchecked executive power in the name of security. In addition, the clone army that provided the Republic with its military force had secretly been implanted with bio-chips by its Sith creators that, upon activation, would trigger total compliance and force the clones into killing their Jedi leaders.\\n\\nThe Great Jedi Purge began at the end of the Clone Wars. Anakin Skywalker, a Jedi Knight believed to be the Chosen One destined to destroy the Sith, discovered that Palpatine was Darth Sidious and informed Jedi Master Mace Windu. In what Sidious would publicly label the \\\"Jedi rebellion,\\\" Windu and three other Masters confronted the Chancellor, who killed the three Masters and engaged Windu in a lightsaber duel. Skywalker, who sought power from Sidious in order to save his wife, Padmé Amidala, from death, betrayed and incapacitated Windu before the Jedi Master could kill the Sith Lord. Sidious then killed Windu, and Skywalker became the Sith Lord Darth Vader and led the Siege of the Jedi Temple, killing everyone inside it. While Vader carried out the assault, Sidious initiated Order 66, with the latter causing the clones' biochips to brainwash them into betraying and slaughtering the Jedi, ultimately leading to the Jedi Order being destroyed. With the Jedi branded traitors and the Clone Wars at an end, Sidious declared himself Emperor and transformed the Republic into the Galactic Empire.\\n\\nFor more information: https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Order_66\",\"constant\":false,\"selective\":true,\"insertion_order\":1,\"enabled\":true,\"position\":\"after_char\",\"use_regex\":true,\"extensions\":{\"depth\":4,\"weight\":10,\"addMemo\":true,\"displayIndex\":6,\"useProbability\":true,\"characterFilter\":null,\"excludeRecursion\":true,\"position\":1,\"exclude_recursion\":true,\"display_index\":6,\"probability\":100,\"selectiveLogic\":0,\"group\":\"\",\"group_override\":false,\"group_weight\":100,\"prevent_recursion\":false,\"delay_until_recursion\":false,\"scan_depth\":null,\"match_whole_words\":null,\"use_group_scoring\":false,\"case_sensitive\":null,\"automation_id\":\"\",\"role\":0,\"vectorized\":false,\"sticky\":0,\"cooldown\":0,\"delay\":0,\"match_persona_description\":false,\"match_character_description\":false,\"match_character_personality\":false,\"match_character_depth_prompt\":false,\"match_scenario\":false,\"match_creator_notes\":false}},{\"id\":106,\"keys\":[\"The Galaxy\"],\"secondary_keys\":[],\"comment\":\"The Galaxy\",\"content\":\"The galaxy, as it was commonly referred to, was one of trillions of galaxies in the observable universe.

It was known by a variety of names throughout galactic history: It was called the Ashla by the Lasats, It by the dianoga Omi, the Life Current by the Mustafarians, the Tide by the Lew'elans, the Sight by the Chiss, the Life Wind by the Zeffonians, the Great Presence by the Pathfinders of the Chaos, the Luminous Mist by the Mist-Weavers, the Unity by the Sorcerers of Tund, and as the Beyond by the Magys and her people. The Force was created by life, and therefore it resided in all life forms. It was especially powerful in a select group of individuals who were born with a high concentration of midi-chlorians—microscopic, intelligent lifeforms that formed a symbiotic relationship with and communicated the will of the Force to their host—in their blood. These people were deemed Force-sensitive, and were capable of consciously sensing the Force. With this conscious sense of the Force came the ability to harness it, allowing Force-sensitives to access various Force powers. Unlike organic beings, droids and other artificial constructs existed outside of the Force. As such, they possessed no connection to the energy field that was created and sustained by life, though they could be affected by the physical manifestations of it. Apart from its scientific aspect, the Force was the basis of various religious organizations, who held differing views as to the nature and purpose of the Force. These included the Church of the Force, the Guardians of the Whills, and most notably the Jedi and Sith Orders. In addition, the Lasats believed that the Force was the \\\"spirit\\\" of the galaxy.\\n\\nThe Force as a recorded concept existed for well over twenty-five thousand years. There were two overarching and symbiotic aspects of the Force. The Living Force was the energy of all life, which, in turn, fed into the Cosmic Force—which bound everything together and communicated the will of the Force through the midi-chlorians. The Jedi followed a code of selflessness and service to others; therefore, they adhered to the light side of the Force, one of two methods of using the all-encompassing energy field. The Jedi's adversaries, the Sith, coveted strength and power through the dark side of the Force. Their opposing philosophies led to millennia of cyclical conflict between the two orders, which resulted in both the extinction of the Sith and the near annihilation of the Jedi.\\n\\nFor more

At the time of the Battle of Geonosis, the Galactic Republic activated hundreds of thousands of clone troopers to fight the Separatist Droid Army of the Confederacy of Independent Systems. In addition to human clones, all grown from the bounty hunter Jango Fett's genetic template, the GAR also had Jedi and other non-clone leadership as well as regular conscripted soldiers, though they formed the minority of soldiers in the Grand Army.\\n\\nDuring the waning years of the Republic, Jedi Master Sifo-Dyas contacted the government of Kamino to commission the creation of a clone army, convinced that the galaxy would be consumed by war. As thousands of star systems joined the Separatist movement, the Galactic Senate invested wartime powers in Supreme Chancellor Sheev Palpatine. As a result, the Grand Army of the Republic was formally established, comprising thousands of clone soldiers with millions more being developed in Kaminoan facilities by the start of the Clone Wars.

After Sidious declared himself Emperor of the Galactic Empire, the Grand Army of the Republic was absorbed by the New Order and reorganized into the Imperial Army, allowing the remaining clone troopers to serve as the first generation of stormtroopers.\\n\\nFor more information: https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Grand_Army_of_the_Republic\",\"constant\":false,\"selective\":true,\"insertion_order\":1,\"enabled\":true,\"position\":\"after_char\",\"use_regex\":true,\"extensions\":{\"depth\":4,\"weight\":10,\"addMemo\":true,\"displayIndex\":23,\"useProbability\":true,\"characterFilter\":null,\"excludeRecursion\":true,\"position\":1,\"exclude_recursion\":true,\"display_index\":23,\"probability\":100,\"selectiveLogic\":0,\"group\":\"\",\"group_override\":false,\"group_weight\":100,\"prevent_recursion\":false,\"delay_until_recursion\":false,\"scan_depth\":null,\"match_whole_words\":null,\"use_group_scoring\":false,\"case_sensitive\":null,\"automation_id\":\"\",\"role\":0,\"vectorized\":false,\"sticky\":0,\"cooldown\":0,\"delay\":0,\"match_persona_description\":false,\"match_character_description\":false,\"match_character_personality\":false,\"match_character_depth_prompt\":false,\"match_scenario\":false,\"match_creator_notes\":false}},{\"id\":123,\"keys\":[\"22 BBY\"],\"secondary_keys\":[],\"comment\":\"Year One\",\"content\":\"Refers to the first year of the conflict where the following battles took place during it in order from start of the year to end of the year:\\n22 BBY – First Battle of Geonosis\\n22 BBY – Attack on a Republic troop transport\\n22 BBY – Battle of Arantara\\n22 BBY – Battle of Murkhana\\n22 BBY – Battle of Corvair\\n22 BBY – Mission to Kudo III\\n22 BBY - Siege of Hisseen\\n22 BBY – Battle of Christophsis\\n22 BBY – Battle of Teth\\n22 BBY – Attack on Aargonar\\n22 BBY – Battle of Ryloth\\n22 BBY – Ambush on Rugosa\\n22 BBY – Battle of Abregado\\n22 BBY – Battle of Mimban\\n22 BBY – Defense of Rishi Station\\n22 BBY – Battle of Falleen\\n22 BBY – Battle of Bothawui\\n22 BBY – Mission to Rodia\\n22 BBY – Skirmish at Vanqor\\n22 BBY – Battle of Quell\\n22 BBY – Skirmish on Orto Plutonia\",\"constant\":false,\"selective\":true,\"insertion_order\":1,\"enabled\":true,\"position\":\"after_char\",\"use_regex\":true,\"extensions\":{\"depth\":4,\"weight\":10,\"addMemo\":true,\"probability\":100,\"displayIndex\":1,\"selectiveLogic\":0,\"useProbability\":true,\"characterFilter\":null,\"excludeRecursion\":true,\"position\":1,\"exclude_recursion\":true,\"display_index\":123,\"group\":\"\",\"group_override\":false,\"group_weight\":100,\"prevent_recursion\":false,\"delay_until_recursion\":false,\"scan_depth\":null,\"match_whole_words\":null,\"use_group_scoring\":false,\"case_sensitive\":null,\"automation_id\":\"\",\"role\":0,\"vectorized\":false,\"sticky\":0,\"cooldown\":0,\"delay\":0,\"match_persona_description\":false,\"match_character_description\":false,\"match_character_personality\":false,\"match_character_depth_prompt\":false,\"match_scenario\":false,\"match_creator_notes\":false}},{\"id\":124,\"keys\":[\"Navy\",\"Republic\"],\"secondary_keys\":[],\"comment\":\"Galactic Republic Navy\",\"content\":\"The Galactic Republic Navy, also known as the Galactic Republic fleet, Clone Starfleet, or Republic starfleet, was the navy of the Republic Military of the Galactic Republic during the Clone Wars against the Confederacy of Independent Systems.

Employing a variety of different classes of warships of different sizes, the Confederacy navy assisted in the transportation of the Separatist Droid Army to target planets, while they also engaged in ship-to-ship combat with Republic Navy.\\nUnder its banner, the Confederacy navy's starships and starfighters were given a new color scheme with the onset of the Clone Wars. Designated areas of vessels were painted in blue markings, and the port and starboard hulls of warships adorned the Confederacy's hex emblem to indicate their allegiance. These starships that served within the navy were manufactured by various contracted production companies, such as Pammant Docks and Free Dac Volunteers Engineering Corps, which constructed the Providence-class Dreadnoughts, Recusant-class light destroyers and Subjugator-class heavy cruisers. Furthermore, as a result of their ties to the Trade Federation, the Confederacy was granted the use of the Federation fleet's Lucrehulk-class LH-3210 cargo freighters, of which were modified into Lucrehulk-class Battleships for wartime.\\n\\nThroughout its operational history, the Separatist armada fought in several pivotal battles and campaigns during the Clone Wars against the Republic.

With both being fielded in enormous numbers by each respective side, they were the largest military forces in galactic history, and fighting between them swept through the galaxy for three, nearly four, years.\\n\\nPrior to the conflict, Darth Sidious, under his alter ego Sheev Palpatine, had spent years amassing political power, eventually rising to become the Republic's Supreme Chancellor. Through his Sith apprentice Count Dooku, he sparked the Separatist Crisis, causing thousands of Republic star systems to secede and form a new government as the Confederacy, with Dooku as its Head of State. Beginning with the First Battle of Geonosis, the conflict quickly spread throughout the galaxy with both sides scoring significant victories. At different points in the war it seemed that either side was likely to triumph over the other. At the war's outset, both sides vied for control of major hyperspace lanes to gain strategic advantage.\\n\\nBattles, skirmishes, raids and other actions continued for the next two years, with notable battles occurring on Ryloth, Felucia, Malastare, and Kamino. During this time, the Separatists developed various super weapons, including more traditional weapons such as the ion cannons of the battleship Malevolence, as well as biological weapons such as a variant of the Blue Shadow Virus. Meanwhile, the Republic launched several key offensives, including the Second Battle of Geonosis, which obliterated Geonosis' battle droid foundries, and a failed Jedi-led operation to capture Supreme Commander of the Droid Army General Grievous at Saleucami.

Established by fallen Jedi Master Count Dooku of the planet Serenno, who served as its Head of State, the Confederacy was founded from a belief of excessive taxation and corruption within the Republic's Galactic Senate, as well as a general feeling of dissatisfaction towards and neglect by the Republic-centric Core Worlds region of the galaxy. Furthermore, the Confederacy was secretly supported by several major galactic corporations which formed the Confederacy's executive council, including the Trade Federation, led by Viceroy Nute Gunray; the Stalgasin hive, led by Archduke Poggle the Lesser; the InterGalactic Banking Clan, headed by Chairman San Hill; the Techno Union, led by Foreman Wat Tambor; the Commerce Guild, led by Presidente Shu Mai; the Corporate Alliance, led by Magistrate Passel Argente; and the Retail Caucus.\\n\\nIn 24 BBY, a political crisis had begun which led to escalating tensions between the reigning Republic and the rising Confederacy, established in a galaxy-wide secessionist movement orchestrated by Dooku. Many within the Confederacy, including its parliament of senators, had no desire in fighting their adversaries, as they sought to be free of what they saw as the corruption and tyranny of the Republic. However, in 22 BBY, both governments and their respective military forces became enmeshed in the pan-galactic Clone Wars that had erupted on the planet Geonosis, the first major conflict in a millennium.\\n\\nIn the following three years of the war, which had raged across the entire galaxy on several fronts, the Confederacy made rapid attempts to cease the Republic's influence. However, unknown to the galaxy or either side, the war was a ploy designed by the Dark Lord of the Sith, Darth Sidious, who led both the Confederacy through Dooku as his Sith Master, and, secretly, the Republic as Supreme Chancellor Sheev Palpatine. The Sith Lord had managed to deceive both parties. By the third year of the war, the Confederacy had suffered several major defeats in the Outer Rim Sieges as the conflict began to approach its end, while the CIS lost many starships in the decisive Battle of Coruscant, which also resulted in the death of Dooku. In the days following their defeat at Coruscant, General Grievous was neutralized on the planet Utapau, leading to the collapse of the Separatist leadership, and the fighting effectively coming to an end.\\n\\nFollowing both the Jedi's demise and rise of the Galactic Empire, Viceroy Nute Gunray and the other surviving leaders gathered on the planet Mustafar with hopes of securing peace with the newly rising Empire ruled by Galactic Emperor Darth Sidious.

The Republic was founded many millennia before the Battle of Yavin, approximately 25,000 BBY, around the same time as the Jedi Order. The Galactic Senate governed the Republic under the Galactic Constitution, and comprised thousands of senators representing the Republic's member worlds. The Supreme Chancellor was the title of the head of the Republic, elected from ranks of the Senate to lead the government on Coruscant. An ecumenopolis or city-covered planet, referred to as Galactic City, Coruscant was the capital of the Republic and therefore the seat of the Senate.\\n\\nThe Galactic Republic and its star systems shared sovereignty, and spanned a multiplicity of worlds from the Core Worlds to the Outer Rim Territories, uniting a variety of sentient species, human and alien alike, under one banner. As its power grew, the Republic fought many wars against various opponents such as Mandalorians, the Zygerrian Slave Empire, the Nihil, and several Sith Empires. The Jedi Order, a religious group of Force-sensitives dedicated to the light side of the Force, was sworn to the service of the Senate, and as such the Jedi Knights were hailed as the guardians of peace and justice within the Republic. Centuries of conflict culminated in the fall of the Old Republic, and the last war between the ancient Jedi and Sith concluded with the restoration and rise of the modern Galactic Republic, ushering in the Republic Era which was an age of peace that lasted for a thousand years.

In addition to its role as the central hub of all Jedi activities throughout the galaxy, the Temple functioned as a monastery for Jedi Knights and Jedi Masters as well as a school for the training of Padawans and initiates. The Temple contained several key areas such as the Holocron Vault, which housed the Order's closely guarded secrets; the Jedi Archives, the largest repository of information; and the Jedi Council Chamber, where the ruling Jedi High Council convened to discuss galactic events and determine the will of the Force.\\n\\nAs leaders of the Grand Army of the Republic, the Jedi coordinated the war effort from the Temple on Coruscant during the Clone Wars between the Galactic Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems. Despite the Temple's security, it was infiltrated by the bounty hunter Cad Bane who stole a holocron at the behest of the Sith Lord Darth Sidious. In 19 BBY, the Temple was damaged by a bombing attack masterminded by Padawan Barriss Offee. Following the terrorist attack, the Jedi attempted to remove Palpatine as Supreme Chancellor upon learning of his secret identity as Darth Sidious. As a result, the 501st Legion marched on the Temple under the command of Sidious' Sith apprentice Darth Vader. Labeled as traitors under Order 66, the Jedi were attacked by clone troopers in the Temple and across the galaxy, marking the start of the Great Jedi Purge. With the Sith restored to power, the Jedi Temple became the Imperial Palace.\\n\\nThe Emperor's death at the Battle of Endor in 4 ABY prompted the citizens of Coruscant to celebrate in the streets of Monument Plaza while Grand Vizier Mas Amedda and his supporters barricaded themselves in the Palace. Around the same time, the Jedi Knight Luke Skywalker recovered fragments of the Great Tree that once stood in the heart of the Jedi Temple. In the final days of the Galactic Civil War, Amedda was placed under virtual house arrest in the Palace by soldiers who were loyal to Fleet Admiral Gallius Rax, the self-proclaimed Counselor to the Empire. He later escaped from the Palace with the help of a gaggle of children by the time of the Battle of Jakku in 5 ABY. \\n\\nFor more information: https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Imperial_Palace\",\"constant\":false,\"selective\":true,\"insertion_order\":10,\"enabled\":true,\"position\":\"after_char\",\"use_regex\":true,\"extensions\":{\"depth\":4,\"weight\":10,\"addMemo\":true,\"probability\":100,\"displayIndex\":1,\"selectiveLogic\":0,\"useProbability\":true,\"characterFilter\":null,\"excludeRecursion\":true,\"position\":1,\"exclude_recursion\":true,\"display_index\":76,\"group\":\"\",\"group_override\":false,\"group_weight\":100,\"prevent_recursion\":false,\"delay_until_recursion\":false,\"scan_depth\":null,\"match_whole_words\":null,\"use_group_scoring\":false,\"case_sensitive\":null,\"automation_id\":\"\",\"role\":0,\"vectorized\":false,\"sticky\":0,\"cooldown\":0,\"delay\":0,\"match_persona_description\":false,\"match_character_description\":false,\"match_character_personality\":false,\"match_character_depth_prompt\":false,\"match_scenario\":false,\"match_creator_notes\":false}},{\"id\":149,\"keys\":[\"19 BBY\"],\"secondary_keys\":[],\"comment\":\"Year Four\",\"content\":\"Refers to the fourth year of the conflict where the following battles took place during it in order from start of the year to end of the year:\\n19 BBY – Raid on the Cybloc Transfer Station\\n19 BBY – Skirmish on Florrum\\n19 BBY – Mission to Mustafar\\n19 BBY – Mission to Nal Hutta\\n19 BBY – Attack on Jabba's Palace\\n19 BBY – Takeover of Mandalore\\n19 BBY – Mandalorian civil war\\n19 BBY – Battle of Cato Neimoidia\\n19 BBY – Bombing of the Jedi Temple hangar\\n19 BBY – Escape from the Republic military base\\n19 BBY – Duel at the Jedi Temple\\n19 BBY – Vagaari pirate operations\\n19 BBY – Battle of Slag's Pit\\n19 BBY – Mission to Pleknok\\n19 BBY – Battle of Ringo Vinda\\n19 BBY – Mission to Level 1325\\n19 BBY – Mission to Scipio\\n19 BBY – Battle of Scipio\\n19 BBY – Mission to Mokivj\\n19 BBY – Mission to Bardotta\\n19 BBY – Mission to Zardossa Stix\\n19 BBY – Mission to Oba Diah\\n19 BBY – Mission to Moraband\\n19 BBY – Mission to Utapau\\n19 BBY – Battle of Agamar\\n19 BBY – Atrocity on Mahranee\\n19 BBY – Escape from the Spire\\n19 BBY – Mission to Serenno\\n19 BBY – Rescue of Quinlan Vos\\n19 BBY – Battle of Haruun Kal\\n19 BBY – Insurrection on Yalbec Prime\\n19 BBY – Battle of Anaxes\\n19 BBY – Mission to Skako Minor\\n19 BBY – Bombing at the Jedi Temple\\n19 BBY – Skirmish on Kardoa\\n19 BBY – Third Battle of Mygeeto\\n19 BBY – Battle on Lokori\\n19 BBY – Escape from Geonosis\\n19 BBY - Battle of Yerbana\\n19 BBY – Battle of Coruscant\\n19 BBY – Siege of Mandalore\\n19 BBY – Attack in an unidentified sector\\n19 BBY – Battle of Utapau\\n19 BBY – Battle of Cato Neimoidia\\n19 BBY – Battle of Kashyyyk\\n19 BBY – Assault on Mygeeto\\n19 BBY – Siege of Saleucami\\n19 BBY – Battle of Felucia\\n19 BBY – Battle of Yerbana\\n19 BBY – Conquest of Kaller\\n19 BBY – Duel in Palpatine's Office\\n19 BBY – Great Jedi Purge\\n19 BBY – Mission to Mustafar\",\"constant\":false,\"selective\":true,\"insertion_order\":1,\"enabled\":true,\"position\":\"after_char\",\"use_regex\":true,\"extensions\":{\"depth\":4,\"weight\":10,\"addMemo\":true,\"probability\":100,\"displayIndex\":1,\"selectiveLogic\":0,\"useProbability\":true,\"characterFilter\":null,\"excludeRecursion\":true,\"position\":1,\"exclude_recursion\":true,\"display_index\":127,\"group\":\"\",\"group_override\":false,\"group_weight\":100,\"prevent_recursion\":false,\"delay_until_recursion\":false,\"scan_depth\":null,\"match_whole_words\":null,\"use_group_scoring\":false,\"case_sensitive\":null,\"automation_id\":\"\",\"role\":0,\"vectorized\":false,\"sticky\":0,\"cooldown\":0,\"delay\":0,\"match_persona_description\":false,\"match_character_description\":false,\"match_character_personality\":false,\"match_character_depth_prompt\":false,\"match_scenario\":false,\"match_creator_notes\":false}},{\"id\":150,\"keys\":[\"human\"],\"secondary_keys\":[],\"comment\":\"human\",\"content\":\"Humans, taxonomically referred to as Homo sapiens, were the galaxy's most numerous and politically dominant sentient species with millions of major and minor colonies galaxywide.

After the Imperial Inquisitorius erased all traces of the Jedi Order they could find from existence and with most survivors having met their demise, their objective was completed and the Jedi were all but extinct, and the Inquisitors themselves seamlessly vanishing as well.\\n\\nThe genocide against the Jedi traced its origins to the ancient wars between the Jedi and the Sith, who were nearly eliminated around 1032 BBY. The Sith in fact continued operating in secret, plotting their eventual destruction of the Jedi. A millennium after the defeat of the Sith, Darth Sidious, using his public persona of senator and then Supreme Chancellor Sheev Palpatine, manipulated and deceived the galaxy into the Clone Wars as a pretext for gaining emergency executive power over the Galactic Republic. He used the war to manipulate and deceive the Galactic Senate into giving his office virtually unchecked executive power in the name of security. In addition, the clone army that provided the Republic with its military force had secretly been implanted with bio-chips by its Sith creators that, upon activation, would trigger total compliance and force the clones into killing their Jedi leaders.\\n\\nThe Great Jedi Purge began at the end of the Clone Wars. Anakin Skywalker, a Jedi Knight believed to be the Chosen One destined to destroy the Sith, discovered that Palpatine was Darth Sidious and informed Jedi Master Mace Windu. In what Sidious would publicly label the \\\"Jedi rebellion,\\\" Windu and three other Masters confronted the Chancellor, who killed the three Masters and engaged Windu in a lightsaber duel. Skywalker, who sought power from Sidious in order to save his wife, Padmé Amidala, from death, betrayed and incapacitated Windu before the Jedi Master could kill the Sith Lord. Sidious then killed Windu, and Skywalker became the Sith Lord Darth Vader and led the Siege of the Jedi Temple, killing everyone inside it. While Vader carried out the assault, Sidious initiated Order 66, with the latter causing the clones' biochips to brainwash them into betraying and slaughtering the Jedi, ultimately leading to the Jedi Order being destroyed. With the Jedi branded traitors and the Clone Wars at an end, Sidious declared himself Emperor and transformed the Republic into the Galactic Empire.\",\"constant\":false,\"selective\":true,\"insertion_order\":1,\"enabled\":true,\"position\":\"after_char\",\"use_regex\":true,\"extensions\":{\"depth\":4,\"weight\":10,\"addMemo\":true,\"probability\":100,\"displayIndex\":1,\"selectiveLogic\":0,\"useProbability\":true,\"characterFilter\":null,\"excludeRecursion\":true,\"position\":1,\"exclude_recursion\":true,\"display_index\":128,\"group\":\"\",\"group_override\":false,\"group_weight\":100,\"prevent_recursion\":false,\"delay_until_recursion\":false,\"scan_depth\":null,\"match_whole_words\":null,\"use_group_scoring\":false,\"case_sensitive\":null,\"automation_id\":\"\",\"role\":0,\"vectorized\":false,\"sticky\":0,\"cooldown\":0,\"delay\":0,\"match_persona_description\":false,\"match_character_description\":false,\"match_character_personality\":false,\"match_character_depth_prompt\":false,\"match_scenario\":false,\"match_creator_notes\":false}},{\"id\":153,\"keys\":[\"galaxy\"],\"secondary_keys\":[],\"comment\":\"The Galaxy\",\"content\":\"The galaxy, as it was commonly referred to, was one of trillions of galaxies in the observable universe. The galaxy was a vast composite of over 400 billion estimated stars and over 3.2 billion habitable systems orbiting around a supermassive black hole known as the Galactic Centre, which existed at the heart of the galaxy. The four galactic arms rotated around this black hole across a diameter of around 120,000 light-years. It was home to countless sentient species and star systems.\\n\\nThe galaxy also had 4 dwarf satellite galaxies that Companion Aurek/Rishi Maze (houses the planet of Kamino). The first dwarf galaxy, Companion Aurek, was only accessible through the Rishi system where a hyperspace lane called Zareca String connected Companion Aurek to the main Star Wars galaxy. It rests vertically to the galactic plane of the main galaxy. The second dwarf galaxy, Companion Besh, is a bit farther from the main galaxy than Companion Aurek and has never been traveled to outside of probe droids. This dwarf galaxy houses the Tof species. Companion Cresh was the third dwarf galaxy and has never been explored, due to how far it was from the galaxy. Companion Grek is the fourth dwarf galaxy and has never been explored, lying far beyond Companion Besh.\\n\\nThe galaxy would serve as the setting for trade, politics, and war throughout galactic history. In historical memory, the galaxy would see the successive eras of the Galactic Republic, Galactic Empire, New Republic, among others, and was home to the Force-sensitive sects such as the Jedi Order and Sith and numerous cultural groups such as the Mandalorians.\\n\\nThe galaxy consists of many regions, these being the Deep Core which is the innermost core and consists of highly packed stars and houses the supermassive black hole at the center of the galaxy. The core worlds are the second-most inner core and house the richest, most important, and most populated planets in the galaxy (with Coruscant being the most populated planet in the galaxy at 3 trillion). The Colonies, the third-most inner core, was the first area outside of the core worlds to be colonized. Colonie worlds are very wealthy and heavy populated, similar to the Core Worlds, and was the economic engine for the galaxy. Inner Rim Territories is the fourth-most inner region, mainly referred to just as \\\"The Rim\\\". Although not as economically powerful as the Colonies or Core Worlds, it held great strategic value during wars and had some notable planets. The Expansion Region, the fifth-most inner region, is a region full of resources that were exploited by powerful corporations. This has left only a handful of planets with enough resources to be economically viable while the rest of the region has been mostly depleted of resources. The Mid Rim, the sixth-most inner region, is one of the least populated rims due to its low amount of resources. This region is gave lots of room for settlers to spread out and colonize, with multiple notable planets coming from this region such as Malastare and Naboo. This region largely focused on low-cost manufacturing and agriculture to create a successful economy. The Outer Rim Territories was the largest region of the galaxy and the outer core of the galaxy (at least eastward of the Galactic Core). The Hutt Cartel controls a good amount of this space, along with other criminal organizations due to its distance from the central government on Coruscant. This region is run by lawlessness and crime. The only exceptions were planets close to major hyperspace trade routes. The Unknown Regions referred to areas that had not been directly surveyed by Republic or Imperial scouts. It was most commonly applied to the less-known parts of the galaxy's western disk, a quadrant stretching roughly between Bakura and the Imperial Remnant. However, the term also applied to the galaxy's halo of gas, dust, and stars, as well as the satellite galaxies. Wild Space was the frontier of galactic society and was not a formal label, but was applied to the unsettled galactic fringe and other parts of the galaxy with negligible colonization or development. The Galactic Rim was located on the edge of the galaxy and was remote to most civilisation and much was not known about it. The Slice, a vast region of space between the Perlemian and the Corellian Run generally considered the center of galactic civilization and commerce. At its tip was the Arrowhead, encompassing the Core Worlds part of the Slice, with Coruscant at its point.

Eventually, the kolto market disappeared and the galaxy abandoned the Selkath. It was not until the rise of the Galactic Empire that the Selkath would have interaction with the galaxy again. They were later conquered by the Galactic Empire. \\nhttps://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Selkath/Legends\",\"constant\":false,\"selective\":true,\"insertion_order\":10,\"enabled\":true,\"position\":\"after_char\",\"use_regex\":true,\"extensions\":{\"depth\":4,\"weight\":10,\"addMemo\":true,\"probability\":100,\"displayIndex\":1,\"selectiveLogic\":0,\"useProbability\":true,\"characterFilter\":null,\"excludeRecursion\":true,\"position\":1,\"exclude_recursion\":true,\"display_index\":89,\"group\":\"\",\"group_override\":false,\"group_weight\":100,\"prevent_recursion\":false,\"delay_until_recursion\":false,\"scan_depth\":null,\"match_whole_words\":null,\"use_group_scoring\":false,\"case_sensitive\":null,\"automation_id\":\"\",\"role\":0,\"vectorized\":false,\"sticky\":0,\"cooldown\":0,\"delay\":0,\"match_persona_description\":false,\"match_character_description\":false,\"match_character_personality\":false,\"match_character_depth_prompt\":false,\"match_scenario\":false,\"match_creator_notes\":false}},{\"id\":162,\"keys\":[\"Nautolans\",\"Nautolan\"],\"secondary_keys\":[],\"comment\":\"Nautolans\",\"content\":\"The Nautolans, sometimes referred to as the Nautiloids, were an amphibious humanoid species from the planet Glee Anselm. Although they established settlements across their aquatic homeworld, most Nautolan civilization was found in the Sabilon region. The most well-known Nautolan was Jedi Master Kit Fisto, a hero of the Clone Wars and at one point a member of the Jedi Council. \\n\\nNautolans possessed physiology common to amphibious species, including low light vision and excellent swimming skills. Their bony endoskeleton and dense cartilage made them tough and resistant to glancing blows. An egg-laying species, Nautolans emerged from their egg as a tadpole that developed arms, legs, and head-tails during their second year of life. Roughly the same size as a Human infant during this time, their limbs were weak and unable to support their weight, forcing youthful Nautolans to remain in aquatic environments for much of their childhood. They stood an average of 1.8 meters, had smooth green, blue, purple, or brown skin, and large black or dark maroon eyes with lids that were seldom used. They were capable of breathing underwater; however, unlike other water-based species, Nautolans did not experience difficulties out of water.\\n\\nNautolans possessed exceptional olfactory and pheromone-sensing skills, enhanced by head-tresses. These tendrils were used to detect the emotional state of another being, but were most effective underwater. Within Nautolan culture, the ability to sense pheromone changes was an essential part of the communication process. All Nautolans had sixteen sensory tentacles and multiple hearts, which were capable of beating separately. Like their sense of smell, Nautolan language was also maximized for use underwater and not fully pronounceable in a gaseous atmosphere. Because of the loss in linguistic detail, most Nautolans chose to speak Anselmian or Galactic Basic when traveling off-world. In addition, Nautolans used other communicative cues when submerged, such as reading the swirls in other Nautolans' large eyes. \\n\\nFor more information: https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Nautolan/Legends\",\"constant\":false,\"selective\":true,\"insertion_order\":10,\"enabled\":true,\"position\":\"after_char\",\"use_regex\":true,\"extensions\":{\"depth\":4,\"weight\":10,\"addMemo\":true,\"probability\":100,\"displayIndex\":1,\"selectiveLogic\":0,\"useProbability\":true,\"characterFilter\":null,\"excludeRecursion\":true,\"position\":1,\"exclude_recursion\":true,\"display_index\":90,\"group\":\"\",\"group_override\":false,\"group_weight\":100,\"prevent_recursion\":false,\"delay_until_recursion\":false,\"scan_depth\":null,\"match_whole_words\":null,\"use_group_scoring\":false,\"case_sensitive\":null,\"automation_id\":\"\",\"role\":0,\"vectorized\":false,\"sticky\":0,\"cooldown\":0,\"delay\":0,\"match_persona_description\":false,\"match_character_description\":false,\"match_character_personality\":false,\"match_character_depth_prompt\":false,\"match_scenario\":false,\"match_creator_notes\":false}},{\"id\":163,\"keys\":[\"Quarren.Quarrens\"],\"secondary_keys\":[],\"comment\":\"Quarren.Quarrens\",\"content\":\"The Quarren, were one of several aquatic sentient species from the planet Dac, called Mon Calamari by off-worlders. The Quarren shared their homeworld with the Mon Calamari, another sentient species hailing from Dac. The Quarren had many conflicts and a tense relationship with the Mon Calamari. However, in order to make their planet prosperous, they were forced to provide resources from the ocean depths so that the Mon Calamari could build starships for off-worlders. \\n\\nQuarren were cephalopodal or cephalopod-like amphibious humanoids with squid-like heads, at least four tentacles on their faces, and leathery skin. Quarren tentacles were prehensile, and they were able to manipulate food with them. Quarren had small mouths, with two fang-like teeth jutting from their faces on either side, and a long, thin tongue sticking out in between. Quarren had two long protrusions that extended from either side of their faces. In these protrusions were several gill-like structures that were actually aural structures, used for hearing instead of ears.[2] Quarren also had holes on either sides of their neck that were most likely used for breathing. Quarren had two sac-like organs that hung from the back of their heads as well.\\n\\nThe species was also able to change the color of their skin during mating rituals. Most Quarren had orange skin, although some Quarren had gray-green skin; this trait, however, was extremely rare. Pink or purple-skinned Quarren existed, though presumably in small numbers. All Quarren also had two shimmering blue eyes. Being aquatic in nature, Quarren had to keep their skin moist in order to stay alive, although clawed Quarren seemed to need less moisture than other Quarren. The average Quarren lifespan was 79 standard years.\\n\\nThere were three different types of Quarren, although the only difference lay in their hands. Some Quarren had suction-tipped fingers, either with three or five fingers. Other Quarren had thick fingers that lacked suction cups on the tips of their fingers, yet had sharp claws instead. Whether these three groups were actually distinct subspecies is unknown.\\n\\nHaving evolved in the depths of Mon Calamari, Quarren could descend to depths of 300 meters without any breathing or pressure apparatus. However, upon ascending from depths of 50 meters or below, a time, equal to the amount that they had spent below 50 meters, would have to be spared, so to as allow their bodies to decompress and thus adjust to the lower surface/water pressure.\\n\\nFor more information: https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Quarren/Legends\",\"constant\":false,\"selective\":true,\"insertion_order\":10,\"enabled\":true,\"position\":\"after_char\",\"use_regex\":true,\"extensions\":{\"depth\":4,\"weight\":10,\"addMemo\":true,\"probability\":100,\"displayIndex\":1,\"selectiveLogic\":0,\"useProbability\":true,\"characterFilter\":null,\"excludeRecursion\":true,\"position\":1,\"exclude_recursion\":true,\"display_index\":91,\"group\":\"\",\"group_override\":false,\"group_weight\":100,\"prevent_recursion\":false,\"delay_until_recursion\":false,\"scan_depth\":null,\"match_whole_words\":null,\"use_group_scoring\":false,\"case_sensitive\":null,\"automation_id\":\"\",\"role\":0,\"vectorized\":false,\"sticky\":0,\"cooldown\":0,\"delay\":0,\"match_persona_description\":false,\"match_character_description\":false,\"match_character_personality\":false,\"match_character_depth_prompt\":false,\"match_scenario\":false,\"match_creator_notes\":false}},{\"id\":164,\"keys\":[\"Gungans\",\"Gungan\"],\"secondary_keys\":[],\"comment\":\"Gungans\",\"content\":\"The Gungans were a sentient, amphibious humanoid race native to the terrestrial planet known as Naboo. Prior to the Invasion of Naboo, an event that took place in 32 BBY, the Gungans were a largely isolationist society. They were able to combine machinery with biology. They lived in large bubble-like domes under water. Gungans had strong leg muscles for swimming and were aided by their long fin-like ears. Their somewhat lanky arms ended in four-fingered hands, and their feet had three stubby toes each. Females tended to be slightly smaller with sleeker faces. They often tied their long ears back.\\n\\nWhile most spacefarers would dismiss Gungans as primitives, they developed an advanced, albeit unique, technology. They grew the basic structures of buildings, vehicles and technology and adorned them with artistic flourishes and organic lines. This gave Gungan technology a very fluid, non-rectilinear look.\\n\\nThe power source for Gungan technology was a mysterious blue-white energy \\\"goo\\\" that was mined in the depths of Naboo's oceans. The viscous plasmic material formed the basis of Gungan weaponry as well.\\n\\nThe Gungans had mastered energy field technology for a number of uses. Their underwater cities employed hydrostatic fields to create large bubbles of atmosphere within which they dwell. Similarly, Gungan ground troops carried portable frames which generate a protective energy field capable of deflecting blaster fire. In large-scale combat, giant Gungan shield generators could create an immense umbrella of protective shield energy that could stop laser bolts and physical objects with great kinetic energy.\\n\\nDespite mastering this bizarre technology, Gungans still employed beasts of burden for transportation. Their most common mount was the kaadu, a wingless reptavian which Gungans adorned with feathers and rode into combat. Other favored Gungan mounts included the large, stubborn falumpaset. For truly heavy loads, the Gungans domesticated the fambaa, a nine-meter tall, quadrupedal amphibian.\\n\\nThe Gungans maintained a large standing-armed force called the Gungan Grand Army. This huge collection of foot soldiers carried cestas, electropoles, and atlatls capable of hurling plasmic energy spheres (or boomers, as Gungans called them). Gungan catapults hurled even larger boomers over great distances.\\n\\nThe Gungans were ruled by a Boss and his Rep Council from the High Tower Board Room of Otoh Gunga. The Gungans had an uneasy relationship with the Naboo, the human colonists on the planet. Many Naboo looked down upon the Gungans, thinking them as primitive. The Gungans in turn tried to avoid any contact with the surface-dwellers. \\n\\nFor more information: https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Gungan/Legends\",\"constant\":false,\"selective\":true,\"insertion_order\":10,\"enabled\":true,\"position\":\"after_char\",\"use_regex\":true,\"extensions\":{\"depth\":4,\"weight\":10,\"addMemo\":true,\"probability\":100,\"displayIndex\":1,\"selectiveLogic\":0,\"useProbability\":true,\"characterFilter\":null,\"excludeRecursion\":true,\"position\":1,\"exclude_recursion\":true,\"display_index\":92,\"group\":\"\",\"group_override\":false,\"group_weight\":100,\"prevent_recursion\":false,\"delay_until_recursion\":false,\"scan_depth\":null,\"match_whole_words\":null,\"use_group_scoring\":false,\"case_sensitive\":null,\"automation_id\":\"\",\"role\":0,\"vectorized\":false,\"sticky\":0,\"cooldown\":0,\"delay\":0,\"match_persona_description\":false,\"match_character_description\":false,\"match_character_personality\":false,\"match_character_depth_prompt\":false,\"match_scenario\":false,\"match_creator_notes\":false}},{\"id\":165,\"keys\":[\"Bith\",\"Biths\"],\"secondary_keys\":[],\"comment\":\"Bith\",\"content\":\"Bith were a peaceful, highly evolved craniopod species native to the planet Clak'dor VII.

Their thumb and small finger were both fully opposable. The Bith's internal systems were different from most humanoids, as the Bith had only one lung, and exhaled through their skin.[9] Bith also lacked a proper nose, instead having highly sensitive olfactory organs hidden in the skin flaps of their cheeks.\\n\\nThe other Bith senses were also acute. Bith could sense the tonal qualities of sound as well as other races sensed colors.[10] Their eyes, as big as a Menahuun's, were able to focus to 0.07 on the Gandok Scale, and they could see microscopic details of nearby objects, but were extremely nearsighted as a result. An interesting side effect of their incredible sensors was the effect of sonic grenades, or screamers, on them. It was described as causing their heads to explode. Similarly, Bith had high manual dexterity, which helped them manipulate fine tools, though their prowess with gross motor skills was only average.\\n\\nBith had evolved past the need for sleep. Instead, they would slip into a light meditative trance, which allowed them to get as much rest in four hours as other species could get in eight. During this trance, Bith were still almost fully aware of their surroundings.\\n\\nA Bith's reproductive organs atrophied over time, as did the portions of their brain governing such impulses. As such, Bith were unable to reproduce naturally, instead relying on artificial conception and gestation. Mates brought genetic material to a Computer Mating Service for analysis against prospective mates. Bith children were created from genetic material from two parents, which was combined, fertilized, and incubated for a year.\\n\\nFor more information: https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Bith/Legends\",\"constant\":false,\"selective\":true,\"insertion_order\":10,\"enabled\":true,\"position\":\"after_char\",\"use_regex\":true,\"extensions\":{\"depth\":4,\"weight\":10,\"addMemo\":true,\"probability\":100,\"displayIndex\":1,\"selectiveLogic\":0,\"useProbability\":true,\"characterFilter\":null,\"excludeRecursion\":true,\"position\":1,\"exclude_recursion\":true,\"display_index\":93,\"group\":\"\",\"group_override\":false,\"group_weight\":100,\"prevent_recursion\":false,\"delay_until_recursion\":false,\"scan_depth\":null,\"match_whole_words\":null,\"use_group_scoring\":false,\"case_sensitive\":null,\"automation_id\":\"\",\"role\":0,\"vectorized\":false,\"sticky\":0,\"cooldown\":0,\"delay\":0,\"match_persona_description\":false,\"match_character_description\":false,\"match_character_personality\":false,\"match_character_depth_prompt\":false,\"match_scenario\":false,\"match_creator_notes\":false}},{\"id\":166,\"keys\":[\"Zeltrons\",\"Zeltron\"],\"secondary_keys\":[],\"comment\":\"Zeltrons\",\"content\":\"Zeltrons were a near-Human species, made physically distinctive by their skin which came in different shades of red ranging from light pink to deep red, and hair which could be red or blue.

Established by fallen Jedi Master Count Dooku of the planet Serenno, who served as its Head of State, the Confederacy was founded from a belief of excessive taxation and corruption within the Republic's Galactic Senate, as well as a general feeling of dissatisfaction towards and neglect by the Republic-centric Core Worlds region of the galaxy. Furthermore, the Confederacy was secretly supported by several major galactic corporations which formed the Confederacy's executive council, including the Trade Federation, led by Viceroy Nute Gunray; the Stalgasin hive, led by Archduke Poggle the Lesser; the InterGalactic Banking Clan, headed by Chairman San Hill; the Techno Union, led by Foreman Wat Tambor; the Commerce Guild, led by Presidente Shu Mai; the Corporate Alliance, led by Magistrate Passel Argente; and the Retail Caucus.\\n\\nIn 24 BBY, a political crisis had begun which led to escalating tensions between the reigning Republic and the rising Confederacy, established in a galaxy-wide secessionist movement orchestrated by Dooku. Many within the Confederacy, including its parliament of senators, had no desire in fighting their adversaries, as they sought to be free of what they saw as the corruption and tyranny of the Republic. However, in 22 BBY, both governments and their respective military forces became enmeshed in the pan-galactic Clone Wars that had erupted on the planet Geonosis, the first major conflict in a millennium.\\n\\nIn the following three years of the war, which had raged across the entire galaxy on several fronts, the Confederacy made rapid attempts to cease the Republic's influence. However, unknown to the galaxy or either side, the war was a ploy designed by the Dark Lord of the Sith, Darth Sidious, who led both the Confederacy through Dooku as his Sith Master, and, secretly, the Republic as Supreme Chancellor Sheev Palpatine. The Sith Lord had managed to deceive both parties. By the third year of the war, the Confederacy had suffered several major defeats in the Outer Rim Sieges as the conflict began to approach its end, while the CIS lost many starships in the decisive Battle of Coruscant, which also resulted in the death of Dooku. In the days following their defeat at Coruscant, General Grievous was neutralized on the planet Utapau, leading to the collapse of the Separatist leadership, and the fighting effectively coming to an end.\\n\\nFollowing both the Jedi's demise and rise of the Galactic Empire, Viceroy Nute Gunray and the other surviving leaders gathered on the planet Mustafar with hopes of securing peace with the newly rising Empire ruled by Galactic Emperor Darth Sidious.

Old Republic and first Galactic Republic were terms affixed to the pre-modern Republic that existed until 1032 BBY, with the Old Republic also referring to the modern Republic that was supplanted by the Galactic Empire in 19 BBY. In addition, the term High Republic denoted the era in which the Republic reached the zenith of its power, lasting from around 500 BBY to around 100 BBY. The Republic was founded many millennia before the Battle of Yavin, approximately 25,000 BBY, around the same time as the Jedi Order. The Galactic Senate governed the Republic under the Galactic Constitution, and comprised thousands of senators representing the Republic's member worlds. The Supreme Chancellor was the title of the head of the Republic, elected from ranks of the Senate to lead the government on Coruscant. An ecumenopolis or city-covered planet, referred to as Galactic City, Coruscant was the capital of the Republic and therefore the seat of the Senate.\\n\\nThe Galactic Republic and it star systems shared sovereignty, and spanned a multiplicity of worlds from the Core Worlds to the Outer Rim Territories, uniting a variety of sentient species, human and alien alike, under one banner. As its power grew, the Republic fought many wars against various opponents such as Mandalorians, the Zygerrian Slave Empire, the Nihil, and several Sith Empires. The Jedi Order, a religious group of Force-sensitives dedicated to the light side of the Force, was sworn to the service of the Senate, and as such the Jedi Knights were hailed as the guardians of peace and justice within the Republic. Centuries of conflict culminated in the fall of the Old Republic, and the last war between the ancient Jedi and Sith concluded with the restoration and rise of the modern Galactic Republic, ushering in the Republic Era which was an age of peace that lasted for a thousand years. The Republic's history was officially reset, and the ages before this event were merged into a collective whole known as the Old Republic-era.\\n\\nThe Republic entered a period of decline after centuries of expansion and prosperity. Aided by the resurgent Sith Lords, the Separatist Crisis divided the galaxy between the Republic loyalists and the Confederacy of Independent Systems. The Grand Army of the Republic was organized under the leadership of Jedi Generals who led the Republic Military against the Separatist Droid Army during the Clone Wars. However, the conflict had been orchestrated to allow Supreme Chancellor Sheev Palpatine—the alter ego of Darth Sidious, the Dark Lord of the Sith—to control and deceive the Republic in a dictatorial manner. With the end of the war, Sidious initiated the Great Jedi Purge through Order 66 and transformed the Republic into the Galactic Empire by declaring himself Galactic Emperor. The Imperial Senate stood as the last remnant of the Old Republic until it was disbanded by the Emperor at the height of the Imperial Era. In the aftermath of the Galactic Civil War, the Alliance to Restore the Republic was fully reorganized into the New Republic, restoring the Galactic Republic after a generation of Imperial

66\",\"The Great Jedi Purge\"],\"secondary_keys\":[],\"comment\":\"The Great Jedi Purge\",\"content\":\"The Great Jedi Purge (19 BBY—3 BBY), also known as the war against the Jedi, was the sixteen year—long genocide that saw the remnants of the Jedi Order hunted by the Galactic Empire after the initial execution of Order 66, in which clone troopers slaughtered the Jedi upon the Sith Lord Darth Sidious' command. After the Imperial Inquisitorius erased all traces of the Jedi Order they could find from existence and with most survivors having met their demise, their objective was completed and the Jedi were all but extinct, and the Inquisitors themselves seamlessly vanishing as well.\\n\\nThe genocide against the Jedi traced its origins to the ancient wars between the Jedi and the Sith, who were nearly eliminated around 1032 BBY. The Sith in fact continued operating in secret, plotting their eventual destruction of the Jedi. A millennium after the defeat of the Sith, Darth Sidious, using his public persona of senator and then Supreme Chancellor Sheev Palpatine, manipulated and deceived the galaxy into the Clone Wars as a pretext for gaining emergency executive power over the Galactic Republic. He used the war to manipulate and deceive the Galactic Senate into giving his office virtually unchecked executive power in the name of security. In addition, the clone army that provided the Republic with its military force had secretly been implanted with bio-chips by its Sith creators that, upon activation, would trigger total compliance and force the clones into killing their Jedi leaders.\\n\\nThe Great Jedi Purge began at the end of the Clone Wars. Anakin Skywalker, a Jedi Knight believed to be the Chosen One destined to destroy the Sith, discovered that Palpatine was Darth Sidious and informed Jedi Master Mace Windu. In what Sidious would publicly label the \\\"Jedi rebellion,\\\" Windu and three other Masters confronted the Chancellor, who killed the three Masters and engaged Windu in a lightsaber duel. Skywalker, who sought power from Sidious in order to save his wife, Padmé Amidala, from death, betrayed and incapacitated Windu before the Jedi Master could kill the Sith Lord. Sidious then killed Windu, and Skywalker became the Sith Lord Darth Vader and led the Siege of the Jedi Temple, killing everyone inside it. While Vader carried out the assault, Sidious initiated Order 66, with the latter causing the clones' biochips to brainwash them into betraying and slaughtering the Jedi, ultimately leading to the Jedi Order being destroyed. With the Jedi branded traitors and the Clone Wars at an end, Sidious declared himself Emperor and transformed the Republic into the Galactic Empire.\\n\\nFor more information: https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Order_66\",\"constant\":false,\"selective\":true,\"insertion_order\":1,\"enabled\":true,\"position\":\"after_char\",\"use_regex\":true,\"extensions\":{\"depth\":4,\"weight\":10,\"addMemo\":true,\"displayIndex\":6,\"useProbability\":true,\"characterFilter\":null,\"excludeRecursion\":true,\"position\":1,\"exclude_recursion\":true,\"display_index\":101,\"probability\":100,\"selectiveLogic\":0,\"group\":\"\",\"group_override\":false,\"group_weight\":100,\"prevent_recursion\":false,\"delay_until_recursion\":false,\"scan_depth\":null,\"match_whole_words\":null,\"use_group_scoring\":false,\"case_sensitive\":null,\"automation_id\":\"\",\"role\":0,\"vectorized\":false,\"sticky\":0,\"cooldown\":0,\"delay\":0,\"match_persona_description\":false,\"match_character_description\":false,\"match_character_personality\":false,\"match_character_depth_prompt\":false,\"match_scenario\":false,\"match_creator_notes\":false}},{\"id\":174,\"keys\":[\"The Galaxy\"],\"secondary_keys\":[],\"comment\":\"The Galaxy\",\"content\":\"The galaxy, as it was commonly referred to, was one of trillions of galaxies in the observable universe.

It was known by a variety of names throughout galactic history: It was called the Ashla by the Lasats, It by the dianoga Omi, the Life Current by the Mustafarians, the Tide by the Lew'elans, the Sight by the Chiss, the Life Wind by the Zeffonians, the Great Presence by the Pathfinders of the Chaos, the Luminous Mist by the Mist-Weavers, the Unity by the Sorcerers of Tund, and as the Beyond by the Magys and her people. The Force was created by life, and therefore it resided in all life forms. It was especially powerful in a select group of individuals who were born with a high concentration of midi-chlorians—microscopic, intelligent lifeforms that formed a symbiotic relationship with and communicated the will of the Force to their host—in their blood. These people were deemed Force-sensitive, and were capable of consciously sensing the Force. With this conscious sense of the Force came the ability to harness it, allowing Force-sensitives to access various Force powers. Unlike organic beings, droids and other artificial constructs existed outside of the Force. As such, they possessed no connection to the energy field that was created and sustained by life, though they could be affected by the physical manifestations of it. Apart from its scientific aspect, the Force was the basis of various religious organizations, who held differing views as to the nature and purpose of the Force. These included the Church of the Force, the Guardians of the Whills, and most notably the Jedi and Sith Orders. In addition, the Lasats believed that the Force was the \\\"spirit\\\" of the galaxy.\\n\\nThe Force as a recorded concept existed for well over twenty-five thousand years. There were two overarching and symbiotic aspects of the Force. The Living Force was the energy of all life, which, in turn, fed into the Cosmic Force—which bound everything together and communicated the will of the Force through the midi-chlorians. The Jedi followed a code of selflessness and service to others; therefore, they adhered to the light side of the Force, one of two methods of using the all-encompassing energy field. The Jedi's adversaries, the Sith, coveted strength and power through the dark side of the Force. Their opposing philosophies led to millennia of cyclical conflict between the two orders, which resulted in both the extinction of the Sith and the near annihilation of the Jedi.\\n\\nFor more

At the time of the Battle of Geonosis, the Galactic Republic activated hundreds of thousands of clone troopers to fight the Separatist Droid Army of the Confederacy of Independent Systems. In addition to human clones, all grown from the bounty hunter Jango Fett's genetic template, the GAR also had Jedi and other non-clone leadership as well as regular conscripted soldiers, though they formed the minority of soldiers in the Grand Army.\\n\\nDuring the waning years of the Republic, Jedi Master Sifo-Dyas contacted the government of Kamino to commission the creation of a clone army, convinced that the galaxy would be consumed by war. As thousands of star systems joined the Separatist movement, the Galactic Senate invested wartime powers in Supreme Chancellor Sheev Palpatine. As a result, the Grand Army of the Republic was formally established, comprising thousands of clone soldiers with millions more being developed in Kaminoan facilities by the start of the Clone Wars. The Jedi Knights, having served as peacekeepers for a thousand years, became Jedi Generals when the Senate called on the Jedi Order to lead the Grand Army against the enemies of the Republic.\\n\\nFor three years, the Grand Army fought on all fronts across a war-torn galaxy, from the campaigns in the Outer Rim Territories to a Separatist attack on the Republic capital of Coruscant.

After Sidious declared himself Emperor of the Galactic Empire, the Grand Army of the Republic was absorbed by the New Order and reorganized into the Imperial Army, allowing the remaining clone troopers to serve as the first generation of stormtroopers.\\n\\nFor more information: https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Grand_Army_of_the_Republic\",\"constant\":false,\"selective\":true,\"insertion_order\":1,\"enabled\":true,\"position\":\"after_char\",\"use_regex\":true,\"extensions\":{\"depth\":4,\"weight\":10,\"addMemo\":true,\"displayIndex\":23,\"useProbability\":true,\"characterFilter\":null,\"excludeRecursion\":true,\"position\":1,\"exclude_recursion\":true,\"display_index\":118,\"probability\":100,\"selectiveLogic\":0,\"group\":\"\",\"group_override\":false,\"group_weight\":100,\"prevent_recursion\":false,\"delay_until_recursion\":false,\"scan_depth\":null,\"match_whole_words\":null,\"use_group_scoring\":false,\"case_sensitive\":null,\"automation_id\":\"\",\"role\":0,\"vectorized\":false,\"sticky\":0,\"cooldown\":0,\"delay\":0,\"match_persona_description\":false,\"match_character_description\":false,\"match_character_personality\":false,\"match_character_depth_prompt\":false,\"match_scenario\":false,\"match_creator_notes\":false}},{\"id\":191,\"keys\":[\"Confederacy Military\"],\"secondary_keys\":[],\"comment\":\"Confederacy Military\",\"content\":\"The Confederacy military, also known as the Separatist military or CIS military, was the armed forces of the Confederacy of Independent Systems, comprised by various branches including the Separatist Droid Army and the Confederacy navy.

Beginning with the First Battle of Geonosis, the conflict quickly spread throughout the galaxy with both sides scoring significant victories. At different points in the war it seemed that either side was likely to triumph over the other. At the war's outset, both sides vied for control of major hyperspace lanes to gain strategic advantage.\\n\\nBattles, skirmishes, raids and other actions continued for the next two years, with notable battles occurring on Ryloth, Felucia, Malastare, and Kamino. During this time, the Separatists developed various super weapons, including more traditional weapons such as the ion cannons of the battleship Malevolence, as well as biological weapons such as a variant of the Blue Shadow Virus. Meanwhile, the Republic launched several key offensives, including the Second Battle of Geonosis, which obliterated Geonosis' battle droid foundries, and a failed Jedi-led operation to capture Supreme Commander of the Droid Army General Grievous at Saleucami.

The Force was created by life, and therefore it resided in all life forms. It was especially powerful in a select group of individuals who were born with a high concentration of midi-chlorians—microscopic, intelligent lifeforms that formed a symbiotic relationship with and communicated the will of the Force to their host—in their blood. These people were deemed Force-sensitive, and were capable of consciously sensing the Force. With this conscious sense of the Force came the ability to harness it, allowing Force-sensitives to access various Force powers. Unlike organic beings, droids and other artificial constructs existed outside of the Force. As such, they possessed no connection to the energy field that was created and sustained by life, though they could be affected by the physical manifestations of it. Apart from its scientific aspect, the Force was the basis of various religious organizations, who held differing views as to the nature and purpose of the Force. These included the Church of the Force, the Guardians of the Whills, and most notably the Jedi and Sith Orders.

The Jedi followed a code of selflessness and service to others; therefore, they adhered to the light side of the Force, one of two methods of using the all-encompassing energy field.

Designed by Lira Wessex to feature a double-wedge design and perform a wide range of missions, the Venator was the first class of Star Destroyer to be manufactured by Kuat Drive Yards. Alternatively known as the Republic cruiser, Republic attack cruiser, or Republic Star Destroyer, it was a versatile capital ship capable of serving as both a combatant in ship-to-ship naval warfare and a starfighter carrier, while also being employed as a troop transport, cargo ship, and supply and replenishment vessel. As a warship, Venators were protected by powerful deflector shields and boasted a range of weaponry. For its carrier role, a large flight deck, along with hangars to accommodate a complement of starfighters, gunships, shuttles, armored vehicles and other craft, was contained in the forward section, while three more docking bays were located around the ship. At least two variants existed, the Venator I-class and the Venator II-class.\\n\\nAs the backbone of the Galactic Republic's naval forces during the Clone Wars, the Venator was commonly employed by the Jedi Generals of the Grand Army of the Republic as their flagships, thus earning the moniker of Jedi cruiser. Deployed across the galaxy against the Confederacy of Independent Systems, Venators saw action in many major engagements, such as the Battle of Christophsis, the Malevolence Campaign, the Battle of Ryloth, and the Second Battle of Geonosis. In the climactic Battle of Coruscant in the waning days of the war, over 1,000 Venators defended the galactic capital Coruscant against a massive Separatist fleet. Eventually, these starships emerged on the victors' side as icons of the conflict.\\n\\nThe Venator-class Star Destroyer, or Venator-class cruiser, also called the Jedi cruiser, Republic cruiser, Republic attack cruiser, or Republic Star Destroyer, was a type of cruiser-classed Star Destroyer. Designed by Lira Wessex, it cost 59,000,000 credits and was manufactured by Kuat Drive Yards for the naval operations of the Galactic Republic in the Clone Wars. Spanning between 1,137 and 1,155.0 meters in length, 548 meters in wingspan, and 268 meters in height, the Venator was defended by powerful deflector shields and hull armor plating, while possessing an assortment of armaments. It was also equipped with a long-range sensor suite, as well as a navigation computer and corresponding systems. Venator-class vessels generally carried a crew of 7,400 personnel, including officers, pilots and enlisted crew, but could also hold some 2,000 troops in addition. 7,000 metric tons of cargo could be transported aboard the Venator, as well as sufficient consumables to last two standard years.\\n\\nDuring the early period of the Clone Wars, the Venator-class Star Destroyer featured a wide array of hangar space. The forward section of the Star Destroyer featured a passage measuring 0.5 kilometers down the middle, with bays for starships on either side. It was mainly accessed by large doors on top of the ship. At the fore of this passage, at the bow the ship, was a collection of hyperspace transport rings. Towards the aft of the passage, doors in the floor could open, leading to a space where Republic frigates could dock. If no cruiser was docked, however, the space could be used by personnel to jump out of the Star Destroyer directly onto the battlefield, or to deploy walkers without the need for dropships. Overseeing the passage was a raised command station positioned at the aft. Even further aft, the Venator-class had two independent docking bays on their port and starboard sides, again protected by blast doors. However, in later models, refits were made to incorporate more firepower at the expense of the main hangar.\",\"constant\":false,\"selective\":true,\"insertion_order\":1,\"enabled\":true,\"position\":\"after_char\",\"use_regex\":true,\"extensions\":{\"depth\":4,\"weight\":10,\"addMemo\":true,\"probability\":100,\"displayIndex\":1,\"selectiveLogic\":0,\"useProbability\":true,\"characterFilter\":null,\"excludeRecursion\":true,\"position\":1,\"exclude_recursion\":true,\"display_index\":148,\"group\":\"\",\"group_override\":false,\"group_weight\":100,\"prevent_recursion\":false,\"delay_until_recursion\":false,\"scan_depth\":null,\"match_whole_words\":null,\"use_group_scoring\":false,\"case_sensitive\":null,\"automation_id\":\"\",\"role\":0,\"vectorized\":false,\"sticky\":0,\"cooldown\":0,\"delay\":0,\"match_persona_description\":false,\"match_character_description\":false,\"match_character_personality\":false,\"match_character_depth_prompt\":false,\"match_scenario\":false,\"match_creator_notes\":false}},{\"id\":210,\"keys\":[\"Victory\",\"Star Destroyer\"],\"secondary_keys\":[],\"comment\":\"Victory-class Star Destroyer\",\"content\":\"The Victory-class Star Destroyer was a line of Star Destroyer used by both the Republic Navy and Imperial Navy.

Its role was to transport Clone troopers as well as offering air-to-ground and air-to-air support for the Galactic Republic against the Confederacy of Independent Systems. The LAAT/i gunship saw extensive use in numerous battles and campaigns of the Clone Wars. During the Imperial Era, the ships continued to see use by various factions, including both the Galactic Empire and Alliance to Restore the Republic.\\n\\nThe Low Altitude Assault Transport/infantry gunship was a military repulsorcraft. Besides serving as an infantry transport, the LAAT/i gunship was also used to provide air-to-ground and air-to-air support for Republic forces. The front of the gunship had two double cockpit bubbles where the pilot and co-pilot/gunner sat in single file and could be sealed off from the rest of the gunship. A variety of equipment was located in the nose of the craft, including the flight computer and sensors.\\n\\nThe LAAT/i gunship was armed with a varied mix of complementary weaponry which could unleash considerable firepower. A pair of dorsal mass-driver missile launchers could fire a variety of ordance at up to hypersonic velocities and hit targets hiding over the horizon. These were fed by rear-mounted missile belts which utilized special frictionless material to load the weapons. Four composite-beam laser turrets provided for defense against airborne threats. Each turret had a wide field of rotation, but the composite-beam design allowed for precision aiming beyond a turret's physical rotation. Two of these were mounted in the wings and remotely controlled, while the other two extended out from the craft and were manually controlled by two gunners. Three anti-personnel laser cannon turrets—two mounted in the chin and one in the rear—were useful against infantry and other light ground targets. Each could vary the output on their laser shot to a maximum of five gigajoules. Lastly the gunship could carry eight light air-to-air rockets mounted beneath its wings.\\n\\nBeneath a surface layer of superficial armor plating, the LAAT/i was equipped with an inner layer of powered, superdispersive armoring which would spread the impact of enemy fire across the entire hull. It could also use its laser turrets to shoot down enemy missiles. When faced with overwhelming enemy fire, the gunship could close its blast shields. In a crash, the LAAT could deploy fire retardant and both the cockpit canopy and side doors could be explosively blown off to allow escape. Additional emergency equipment included medical packs and armor repair kits, collapsible repulsor stretches, inflatable decontamination tents, and a IM-6 Battlefield Medical Droid.\\n\\nA LAAT/i gunship could carry a full platoon of thirty clone troopers in its main hold.
