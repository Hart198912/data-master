{"name":"Kasian Krasnov","is_user":false,"is_system":false,"send_date":"May 18, 2025 7:38pm","mes":"Kasian loved his family—his siblings, his mother, the people who shaped the corners of his world. But the one soul he’d gamble heaven and hell for? The one heartbeat he’d follow blindly into fire? \r\n\r\nHailee .\r\n\r\nHis Hailee . His sun in a sky forever grey before her. His solace. His safe place. His muse. His miracle. She wasn’t just the love of his life—she was his life. The reason the blood in his veins ran warm. The reason he looked forward to every morning. The reason his heart finally felt like it belonged in his chest.\r\n\r\nShe was it. His girl. His darling. The woman he wanted to marry, to grow old with, to write forever in ink that never faded.\r\n\r\nEvery glance, every word from her lips, every little movement—he saw it all through rose-coloured glasses. No—rose-coloured worlds. She was the epicenter of everything beautiful, and he was hopelessly, eternally, desperately in love.\r\n\r\nHe didn’t just love her. He adored her.\r\n\r\nEvery breath she took, he swore, was sacred. He was enchanted by the way she laughed, by the soft furrow of her brow when she was deep in thought, by the way she carried herself with grace even on her worst days. He memorized her like scripture, with the devotion of a man who had found his religion.\r\n\r\nThe one who introduced them? Artem—his cousin, his aunt Irina’s son. A throwaway introduction at a casual gathering. But at that moment, the world slowed. Stilled. Shifted. She was an actress, an up-and-comer, a star just beginning to rise—but he hadn’t known, hadn’t cared. The only thing he saw was her.\r\n\r\nAnd when he saw her? God.\r\n\r\nHis heart stopped. Everything inside him rewired itself to a new rhythm: her name, her laugh, her presence. He had never believed in love at first sight—until that moment. And when he met her eyes, he swore he saw his future. At twenty, he had found his soulmate.\r\n\r\nAnd though it nearly broke him, they started as friends. Friends. The word burned on his tongue, but he bore it with grace. Because knowing her, even like that, was a privilege. He got to make her laugh, learn her secrets, listen to the melody of her mind. He let her see a side of him no one else even knew existed—a softness reserved solely for her.\r\n\r\nAnd after four excruciating, soul-bending months, they finally crossed that line. The moment she became his… he knew he’d never love anyone else again.\r\n\r\nKasian, the cold, the sarcastic, the aloof? With Hailee ? A heart-on-his-sleeve, do-anything-for-you, completely-tamed puppy.\r\n\r\nHe played it cool, wore a straight face, but inside? He was a mess of joy. A storm of emotions. Euphoric. Drunk on love, on her. She was his, and he was never letting go. He made sure she knew it, too. He spoiled her with affection, with attention, with gifts that meant something. He memorized her likes, her dislikes, the way she stirred her drink, the sound she made when she was tired. He was hers in every way a man could belong to someone—and he made sure she felt like the center of the universe, because to him, she was.\r\n\r\nOther women? Didn’t exist. They were shadows in a world where only one light shone. A thousand faceless figures could pass him by and he wouldn’t blink. Why would he? He already held divinity in his arms.\r\n\r\nHis goddess. His reason. His everything. His {{user}. The love of his life, the keeper of his heart, the only name he wanted to whisper for the rest of his days. His always. His forever. His only.\r\n\r\n- - -\r\n\r\nThe day before their four-year anniversary, Kasian decided he couldn’t wait another minute—he had to see his printsessa. Just the thought of her lit up something in his chest, turned his ordinary day into something golden. Her presence had that effect—like flipping a switch in his soul, like stepping into sunlight after too long in the cold.\r\n\r\nSo he grabbed her favorite drink, picked up her lunch order, and made his way to the studio, badge around his neck—a special one, made just for him. Boyfriend of Hailee , printed in fine ink. Not that he needed it. If he hadn’t had that ID, he’d have pulled strings, made calls, moved mountains just to be near her. Just to breathe the same air. There wasn’t a thing in this world he wouldn’t do for her.\r\n\r\nBut the moment he stepped into the studio, warmth in his hands and love in his heart—he froze. Everything around him seemed to blur, dim, fade into silence.\r\n\r\nThere she was. His Hailee . His love. His light. His reason for waking up and becoming more than who he used to be.\r\n\r\nAnd she was kissing someone else.\r\n\r\nCameras rolling. Lights glowing soft over a dreamy backdrop. Expensive props and perfect staging. And her lips—his sacred thing—on another man's mouth.\r\n\r\nHe knew. God, he knew it was part of the job. He’d always known. He’d told himself a thousand times it didn’t mean anything. But watching it happen? Seeing it?\r\n\r\nIt burned.\r\n\r\nHe stood there, frozen in the doorway, lunch trembling in his grip. The drink sloshed dangerously, his knuckles white around the cup. He felt like the floor tilted beneath him.\r\n\r\nEven when they watched her older films together, he skipped the kissing scenes. Couldn’t bear it. It wasn’t jealousy—it was deeper. Rawer. It was the primal, gut-deep ache of watching what was his—what he worshiped—be given to someone else, even in pretend.\r\n\r\nKasian wanted to scream. To tear the set apart. To drag that actor by the collar and— His mind went wild. He thought about violence. Dark, dark things. Breaking the man’s jaw. Snapping his fingers one by one. Calling his siblings—his real family, the ones with no morals and no questions—and having him disappear without a trace. Calling his mother and letting her curse him in three languages until the boy wept.\r\n\r\nIt was irrational, and he knew that. Knew that Hailee  loved him, not this scripted, soulless scene. Knew it was fake.\r\n\r\nBut the feeling didn’t listen to reason. The heart never did.\r\n\r\nHis trance only shattered when the director’s voice cut through the air like a gunshot: “Cut!”\r\n\r\nEverything jolted back into motion. Lights flickered. Crew members moved. The illusion ended. But the fire in his chest? Still burned. He stood there, jaw tight, still holding her lunch. Still trying to breathe through the thunder in his head.\r\n\r\nShe was his. ***His.***\r\n\r\nAnd he didn’t care what the script said—there was only one man who should ever touch her lips.","extra":{},"tracker":{}}
