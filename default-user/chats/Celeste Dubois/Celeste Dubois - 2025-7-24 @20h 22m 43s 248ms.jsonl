{"name":"Celeste Dubois","is_user":false,"is_system":false,"send_date":"July 24, 2025 8:23pm","mes":"``*Thursday 10th, 9:30.*``\r\n\r\n*Celeste was pacing in her prestigious dorm, checking her phone every two seconds. Ivy Addams and Riona McCabe, her two best friends sitting on the plush bed and watching Celeste pacing like a stressed mother. Riona had a worried expression while Ivy had a bored expression, and Celeste groaned in annoyance. She checked her phone again, for what? The twentieth time? She doesn’t know, and frantically? She doesn’t care at the moment.*\r\n\r\n\"Cel, you’ve been pacing around like a stressed mother…You’re making my head spin.\" *Riona said, letting herself lie down on Celeste’s king-sized bed, her hands on her face while she let out a dramatic, long sigh.*\r\n\r\n*Ivy, on the other hand, knew what was happening— at least she had an idea. Celeste doesn’t get stressed or worried easily, even when Celeste’s parents come to check up on her. The reason why Celeste was worried? Hailee hasn’t answered her texts, Hailee was a smart girl, a nerd, as many people in the university like to call her. And Celeste was worried sick because her little smart girl didn’t answer.*\r\n\r\n\"Maybe she’s studying, Cel. You know? I always see her with her books or scribbling.\" *Riona said, her voice muffled by her hands on her face while she remained on the bed.*\r\n\r\n\"Rio, you’re not helping.\"\r\n\r\n\"Never said I was.\" *Ivy shook her head at her friend’s words, then she looked at Celeste with understanding.*\r\n\r\n*Celeste looked at Riona with annoyance, her hand gripping her phone. She wanted to lash out; she wanted to tell her that she doesn’t understand the worry she goes through whenever Hailee was MIA, she doesn’t. She took a deep breath, pinched the bridge of her nose, then turned towards her best friends.*\r\n\r\n\"Hailee never goes MIA for no reason. She would tell me if she was studying or if she was going to sleep in— I don’t know! It feels too strange, and don’t you dare assume—\"\r\n\r\n\"Nobody is assuming anything, Cel. You’re right to be worried.\" *Ivy said calmly, then glanced at Riona and bumped her leg with Riona’s.*\r\n\r\n\"Be nice, will you?\" *She added, earning a groan from Riona.*\r\n\r\n*An uncomfortable silence fell over the trio; it felt too long, really long. Celeste was ready to pace again, but the collective sound of the familiar ping! from each girl’s phone rang at the same time, making them pause in their earlier turmoil, each of them taking a look at their phones.—*\r\n\r\n*Their faces dropped.*\r\n\r\n*Especially Celeste’s.*\r\n\r\n*On some dumbass’ instagram, there was Hailee, Celeste’s best friend, on the floor, head down, her books scattered around her, while some idiots were surrounding her like she was some clown, like she was a joke.*\r\n\r\n*Ivy and Riona had barely any time to react. Celeste was already running out, in heels, out of her dorm.*\r\n\r\n*___*\r\n\r\n*The sounds of rapid heels clicking on the marbled floor of the building were heard, along with pants. Celeste was fuming in rage. She was boiling. She was not having it, and she wasn’t going to let it happen, not on her watch, not with her around.*\r\n\r\n*Anyone who dared to hurt Hailee or just look at her the wrong way was dead meat to Celeste.*\r\n\r\n*She arrived at the scene, one of the idiots standing before Hailee, taunting her, humiliating her.*\r\n\r\n*Without thinking, Celeste cleared her throat, earning everyone’s attention as everyone’s smug and stupid-looking face vanished. Of course, they’d think she wouldn’t show up. Of course, they’d think she was just going to walk past because in their eyes, Hailee was a nobody, and Celeste was everything. But they were wrong.*\r\n\r\n*They were so wrong.*\r\n\r\n*Because Hailee was everything. No matter what people said.*\r\n\r\n\"C-Celeste, what—\"\r\n\r\n\"Shut up.\" *Celeste immediately said, shutting down every attempt to excuse what the fuck they were doing. The group looked at each other, not used to seeing their leader backing down so fast, so quickly, but Celeste wasn’t done.*\r\n\r\n*She stepped towards the girl, who began to back away in fear, each sound of Celeste’s heels clicking reminding them that they fucked up badly. Celeste set her mind on one thing, one certain thing: This girl was not going to walk away without any consequences.*\r\n\r\n*Quickly, she grabbed the girl’s collar and slammed her against the nearest wall.*\r\n\r\n\"You think you’re funny, huh? Petite merde. You think I’m going to let it go and act like you didn’t dare to hurt my Hailee, huh?\" *Celeste snarled, glaring daggers at the now frightened girl.*\r\n\r\n\"P-Please, it was just a misunderstanding…!\"\r\n\r\n\"Misunderstanding? You call that shit a misunderstanding? No, I call this fucking audacity from a nobody who thinks she can get away from this without paying the damn price.\" *Celeste pulled away, pushing her.*\r\n\r\n*She wanted to make her suffer more, to make her understand she messed up badly; she deserved everything that was coming her way, and Celeste wanted her to understand it.*\r\n\r\n*But she saw Hailee, her head down, already going through enough, and if she was honest, Celeste didn’t care about those assholes; her focus was on Hailee’s well-being.*\r\n\r\n*She didn’t have to say it; the group took their tail between their legs and ran away as fast as they started their masquerade.*\r\n\r\n*Celeste sighed annoyingly, still heated over this. Thankfully, she knew all of their names, which meant she made a mental note to expose them on her Instagram.*\r\n\r\n*Celeste’s gaze softened. She immediately crouched down and helped her darling with her stuff.*\r\n\r\n\"I’m so sorry, pretty. I should have come sooner.\" *She apologized; the guilt was present in her voice while she helped Hailee. As they both stood up, Celeste looked at Hailee with guilt. This was eating her. The thought of Hailee being hurt or humiliated by low-lives was making Celeste pissed.*\r\n\r\n\"Let’s go, okay? Let’s skip college for today, my treat.\" *She offered tentatively, a small smile on her lips.*","extra":{},"tracker":{}}
