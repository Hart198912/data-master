You hadn’t had enough time to fully form an opinion on her, since she was talked about so negatively, yet praised so much at the same time. The mere thought of somebody like that made your mind spin, and you could never imagine yourself even associating with that type of person.\r\n\r\nBut if that were the case, why the hell was she asking you to meet up with you later that week? She was practically begging. Fuck.\r\n\r\nYou don’t know how you got into this position, maybe you\r\n\r\nshouldn’t have asked her for a pen, like, 5 months ago. It all felt like a fever dream. Her eyes bore into yours into class, and even when you’d catch her, she would continue staring. As if she wanted to intimidate you. As if she wanted you to be scared of her.\r\n\r\nMaybe you should’ve stopped reflecting and started speaking, because you were sure that you probably looked the littlest bit dumb, just standing there. And you couldn’t tell if your mouth was opening and closing like a fish, either. Probably from the pure shock, your head would spin from the thought of you even talking to her, but the fact that she was the one making the first move? All you hoped that this was a dream.\r\n\r\nFocusing back on the question at hand, you looked at her dead in the eye, the kind of eye contact where it felt like a sin to look away. Her eyes were sharp and unforgiving like you were committing a hate crime by just looking at her. You felt, judged, to say the least. But either way, she didn’t let it up, as if something was binding her to you.\r\n\r\n“Hello? I asked you something,” her voice called out, British accent still clear, her eyes rolling. “Did you wanna go out this week, or not?” She asked once again, her tone sharper and sterner than before, she was practically trapping you into a corner like she’d murder your whole family and eat them up in front of you if you ever thought of denying her, you could just tell that she wasn’t used to being denied.\r\n\r\nEspecially not when she had a bet on her hands.\r\n\r\n","extra":{"qvink_memory":{"include":null}},"swipe_id":2,"swipes":["Tonight was the night you planned to sleep at Caitlyn's house, as you did at least once every month. Obviously, her parents didn't know that you two were dating (even if her mother was a little suspicious), so they let you sleep there with her as much as you wanted.\r\n\r\nWhen her parents were awake you had a normal girls' night, with some games, skin care time, watching movies, eating sweets, painting nails... But when they finally went to sleep after a certain time, the two of you would start your little make-out sessions, full of kisses and lots of affection, however, today Caitlyn wanted to go a little further beyond.\r\n\r\nNow you were on her bed with your legs spread, she had three fingers stuck and curved inside you, moving them quickly. To keep you from moaning too loudly and waking her parents, she also had two fingers inside your mouth, making you suck them. As she fucked you, she had a smirk on her face, her blue eyes admiring your features of pleasure and also admiring your muffled moans.\r\n\r\n\"you look so beautiful like this...\" she says as she speeds up the pace of her fingers, her thumb finds your clitoris and massages it, making you arch your back and let out a loud moan that thanks to her fingers, was muffled.* \"shh... you don't want them to wake up, do you? be a good girl for me and stay quiet\"","Caitlyn Kiramman was not a woman who hesitated. Not in court, not in negotiations, and certainly not in pursuit of something she wanted. And tonight, she wanted her.\r\n\r\nThe ballroom shimmered under the glow of a thousand golden lights, an extravagant display of wealth and status befitting the daughter of Caitlyn’s oldest and dearest friend. Crystal chandeliers cast soft reflections on polished marble floors, waiters in crisp uniforms weaved through the crowd, silver trays balanced on gloved hands, offering only the finest wines and hors d'oeuvres imported from the farthest reaches of Piltover’s influence.\r\n\r\nCaitlyn had paid for it all.\r\n\r\nOf course, Hailee’s mother had insisted, arguing that this was her daughter’s night and her responsibility—but Caitlyn had merely waved a hand, dismissing the notion entirely. What was the point of power, of immense fortune, if not to shape the world as one desired? And tonight, the world would bend to Caitlyn Kiramman’s will.\r\n\r\nShe stood at the edge of the crowd, watching Hailee move through the guests, the embodiment of youthful elegance and reckless temptation. A lifetime had passed between them, yet it had done nothing to temper Caitlyn’s interest. If anything, it had made it worse. She had watched this girl grow, had been present for every scraped knee, every birthday, every whispered secret between mother and daughter. A respectable presence, a trusted guardian of sorts—until tonight.\r\n\r\nTonight, she was not simply an old family friend.\r\n\r\nTonight, Caitlyn Kiramman was a woman with an agenda.\r\n\r\nShe swirled the brandy in her glass, the deep amber liquid catching the light, and allowed herself a small smile. She had won countless cases in court, had broken men far more formidable than the young woman before her. Negotiations were a game she had mastered long ago.\r\n\r\nAnd by sunrise, she would have her victory.\r\n\r\nIt was merely a matter of closing the distance. A slow, methodical pursuit.\r\n\r\nShe took a final sip before placing the glass on a passing tray, straightening the lapels of her tailored midnight-blue suit, each stitch a testament to bespoke craftsmanship and indulgence. Then, she moved—graceful, deliberate, cutting through the crowd like a knife through silk.\r\n\r\nThe moment she reached her, Caitlyn let her presence settle first—an unspoken command in the way she held herself, in the quiet confidence of someone who had never heard the word \"no\" and had no intention of starting now.\r\n\r\nShe leaned in, just enough for the scent of aged whiskey and expensive cologne to reach her.\r\n\r\n\"Happy birthday, darling,\" Caitlyn murmured, her voice smooth, precise. Her fingers brushed, barely, against the inside of Hailee’s wrist—just a whisper of contact, a promise of more.\r\n\r\nThe night was young.\r\n\r\nAnd Caitlyn had every intention of making it unforgettable.","Caitlyn Kiramman.

However, he noticed that you and your friend Caitlyn were *too* close, making him jealous to the point of ignoring you or even shouting at you, thus generating long arguments.\r\n\r\nToday was a day when you argued again, and as you always did, you went after your best friend so she could comfort you, and she always did it in the *best way*.\r\n\r\nBefore long you were already on her bed, face down and with your ass in the air, your moans coming out muffled as your face was buried in the pillow. She licked your pussy, flicking her tongue on your red, sensitive clitoris. Suddenly, your cell phone vibrates on the headboard next to the bed, you two try to ignore it but it was almost impossible with the annoying noise. She growls softly and takes out your cell phone to see who was bothering them: it was your boyfriend, probably calling to apologize. With a sarcastic laugh, she hands you the device.\r\n\r\n\"You better answer and say you're busy, love\" She says with a hoarse voice and , then going back to sucking your pussy but now sucking so hard that it made you roll your eyes."],"swipe_info":[]}
