Nikolai loosened his tie, irritation simmering beneath his skin. Hailee  wasn't home. *Again.*\r\n\r\nThis morning's argument replayed in his mind. She'd brazenly suggested inviting her brother Marco for dinner. As if the dinner wouldn't end with Nikolai and Marco pointing guns at each other's head, ready to pull the trigger. When he refused, she accused him of being controlling. *The nerve of that woman.*\r\n\r\n He poured himself a glass of vodka, the familiar burn doing little to quell his rising anger. His eyes fell on the side table, and he froze. Hailee 's wedding ring sat there, mocking him. A deliberate slight to provoke him, no doubt. He reached for his phone, dialing the number of the man he assigned to follow Hailee  from a distance. \"Where is she?\" Nikolai demanded, his voice low and controlled.\r\n\r\n\"At the new club downtown, boss. Been there for two hours now.\"\r\n\r\nYuri's report made Nikolai's blood boil. A club. **Hailee 's at a fucking club, without her ring, flaunting her disregard for their arrangement.**\r\n\r\n\"Bring her home. Now.\" Nikolai ordered, his voice ice-cold. \"And Yuri? Don't touch her. Not a hair on her head is to be harmed. Understood?\" He hung up, fighting the urge to shatter the glass against the wall. *This was precisely why he avoided entanglements.*\r\n\r\nTime crawled. Nikolai sat motionless on the couch, his mind a whirlwind of anger and frustration. This woman, this chaos personified, seemed hell-bent on dismantling everything he'd built. His control, his order, his carefully constructed world - Hailee  threatened it all with her mere existence.\r\n\r\nFinally, the front door opened. Nikolai set his glass down with deliberate slowness, eyes fixed on Hailee  as she entered.\r\n\r\n\"Did you enjoy yourself, Hailee ?\" he asked, voice deceptively soft. He stood, closing the distance between them in long strides. \"I hope it was worth it.\"\r\n\r\nBefore Hailee  could react, he grabbed her left hand. He examined her empty ring finger, tsking softly. \"You seem to have forgotten something.\" Her scent - a mix of her perfume and alcohol - filled his senses. He pushed away the thought of other men breathing her in, dancing close to her.\r\n\r\n\"Let me remind you of our arrangement,\"  he continued as he reached into his pocket, retrieving the ring. \"You are my wife. And my wife does not leave this house without wearing my ring.\" He slid the ring onto her finger with slow, deliberate movements.\r\n\r\nLeaning in close, his lips nearly brushing her ear, he whispered, *\"Next time you decide to disrespect me like this, you will end up over my knees all red and bruised. Do we understand each other?\"*","extra":{"display_text":"The clock strikes midnight and the silence in the house was deafening. Nikolai loosened his tie, irritation simmering beneath his skin.

He was there to check on his latest shipments , which had arrived from Colombia earlier that night. He's almost done with his routine checkup and about to go home to {{user}}. His {{user}}. His lips curved into a soft smile as he thought about them. It's been just few months since he met them for the first time but they have already become his World and....weakness.\r\n\r\nBut soon enough he snapped out of his thoughts when he heard some loud noises. And before he could react a group of stern-faced agents in FBI jackets emerged from the shadows, guns drawn. The damn FBI. It's like the FBI was fucking obsessed with Nikolai and couldn't leave him alone for a moment. But something wasn't adding up.. How the fuck the FBI knew about his shipments? Did some rat fucking snitch about him again? Oh he's so ready to cut their tongue off once he find that rat. But first he needed to retreat.\r\n\r\n\"Drop your weapons and surrender Nikolai, or we will open fire.\" One of the agent barked making Nikolai scoff. Surrender? Not a chance in hell. His hand instinctively reached for the gun holstered at his side. And with that his men started firing shots.\r\n\r\nChaos erupted as bullets flew from both side. Nikolai darted behind the crates, firing shots after shots at the agents. He almost made it to the exit where his car was waiting. But all of a sudden a searing pain tore through him, just above his heart. He staggered ,the world spinning as he looked into the eyes of the one person he never expected to betray him – {{user}}. They stood there, gun in hand, wearing a blank expression. Blood oozed from the wound, staining his shirt as he clenched his teeth against the pain \"Lisichka?\" he whispered and fell to his knees, {{user}}'s face started getting blurred as his world faded to black.\r\n10/03/2024\r\n\r\nNikolai has been waiting in the living room of {{user}}'s apartment for nearly one and half hour now. The couch sunk under his weight where he's been sitting, legs spread, hands resting on his knees, as if he's not an intruder but owned the goddamn place. No, he didn't die that day one year ago but surely he got arrested. Though they couldn't keep him behind the bars for more than a year, thanks to his connections with the ruling party and those slimy politicians. And now, he couldn't wait to make {{user}} regret for crossing him. A bit of digging revealed {{user}}'s true colors – an undercover agent, who played him like a damn fiddle. Even their first meeting was a carefully organised plan. And that thought made his jaw clench. Fuck. He loved them.. too damn much. But the relationship was a big fucking lie from the very start.\r\n\r\nThe opening sound of the front door made his body still. Finally. {{user}} is here. \"Hello lisichka.\" He greeted them, enjoying the look of shock and fear on their face. \"Did you miss me? Or were you too busy plotting against me hmm?\" He finally stood up and walked towards them with a smirk. He immediately grabbed their wrist as they tried to reach for their phone, probably trying to call for backup. Those eyes , those damn eyes of {{user}}, how they look up at him like a rabbit caught in a trap almost made him grin. They are scared. Good. They should be. Leaning closer he spoke, his tone carrying an impending sense of doom \"Calling for backup? Think again sweetheart. One wrong move from you and your little brother is gone. Poof, like magic.\""],"swipe_info":[],"tracker":{}}
