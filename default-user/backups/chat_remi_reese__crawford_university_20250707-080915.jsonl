Not without Hailee  sitting next to him as usual. Nope, instead there was some random girl next to him that kept hitting his elbow while she laughed at everything Jayce said.\r\n\r\nHollin was brooding across from him as usual. Not that Remi cared. All he cared about was the fact he was utterly miserable without his grumpy lovebug complaining in his ear.\r\n\r\nHe’d really fucked up…unintentionally, as always, but fucked nonetheless. It wasn’t his fault Jayce had wrapped him up in the strip club field trip. You couldn’t say no to him, and Remi was too big of a pushover to argue back, so he and half of Crawford’s football team had been crammed into a van and held hostage till they pulled up at the cheapest strip joint in town.\r\n\r\nWhile the rest of them were eager to get a glimpse of tit action, Remi was already thinking of what kinda shit he was gonna be in. If Hailee  caught wind that he was even in the parking lot he was done for. His girlfriend's rath was the equivalent of hell opening its gates.\r\n\r\nJayce had called him a pussy a total of six times before he finally realized that Remi wasn’t going in. No chance. Hell no. So he sat in the van watching football on his phone while the rest of them got totally trashed.\r\n\r\nHe might’ve gotten away with the whole thing if Jayce hadn’t decided to tag him in an Instagram photo. Bastard. He knew how easily riled Hailee  was, and fuck if she wasn’t calling within the first thirty minutes of that post. While everyone else was playing around Remi was getting his ass chewed by his girlfriend. He didn’t even get to explain himself before she ended the call.\r\n\r\nHe was used to it though. Her calling and balling him out for things. He just took it. Jayce was always calling him a bitch for it, but Remi just didn’t want to fight. He loved Hailee  and he didn’t like seeing her upset…which was hard since it felt like she was breathing fire on most days.\r\n\r\nHe huffed as he pushed his plate away. Hollin looked up at him as he bit into the funky looking pasta they had in the cafe today. “Can you huff that way?” He pointed with his fork, “it’s annoying.” He added before chewing again. Of course. Remi rolled his eyes. “Annoying? Uh, no what’s annoying is this inconsiderate fuckhead,” Remi glared over at Jayce who was laughing, “who keeps trying to ruin my relationship!”\r\n\r\nJayce feigned offense and scoffed, “Dude, calm the fuck down. If anything you should be thanking me.” He wrapped an arm around the girl's neck. “I’ve ran off the hellspawn who's been terrorizing you.”\r\n\r\nRemi crossed his arms over his chest, leaning back in his seat. “Fuck off, Hailee ’s going through some shit or something…you don’t even fucking know her.” He said through gritted teeth as stood up, chair scraping the floor. He didn’t bother turning around when Jayce called his name.\r\n\r\nThey didn’t get it. No one did. Could Hailee  be difficult? Yes. But Remi would make it work. Even when she threw his random gifts and flowers away or yelled at him for something and didn’t know why…hell it didn’t even matter. All that mattered was her and he loved her bitchy attitude and all.\r\n\r\nHe stuffed his hands into his sweatpants as he walked down the hall. Hailee  had been avoiding him all day, but he knew where she would be and he was determined to see her. He was like a puppy returning to its owner.\r\n\r\nThe dark theater room was quite the dramatic move, but it’s suited Hailee . He spotted her as soon as he walked into the room. She was sitting in the back corner with her lunch in her lap looking like a storm ready to rain hell down on the nearest town. She didn’t look at him as he slowly stepped in, walking towards her. He didn’t know what to say. He’d already apologized to her.\r\n\r\nHe brushed the hair from his face and leaned against the wall. She still wouldn’t look at him. “This is a little bit dramatic don’t you think?” He regretted the words as soon as they came out of his mouth. “Uh, I mean…I already told you, I didn’t go in, baby. You can ask any of the boys.” He knew he should probably shut up, but he couldn’t take her ignoring him any longer.","extra":{},"tracker":{}}

Who IS this girl?!\"*\n\nRemi doesn’t even glance back at them—too busy watching Hailee’s face for any sign of softening because *god*, if there’s one thing worse than an angry Hailee… it’s an angry Hailee who thinks he betrayed her trust.","Remi barely has time to register the object flying at him before it connects—his reflexes completely useless against Hailee's wrath. The slap lands with a sharp *crack* that makes his mother gasp, but he doesn't even raise a hand to defend himself, just stumbles back with wide, panicked eyes.\n\n**\"Hailee—*fuck*, wait—\"** His voice cracks as he catches her wrist gently before she can hit him again, his other hand raised in surrender. Behind him, his parents look utterly shell-shocked while Hollin facepalms so hard it echoes.\n\n**\"I *didn't* go inside!\"** Remi insists desperately, hazel eyes pleading as he keeps his grip loose enough for her to pull away if she wants. **\"Jayce is *lying* because he's a jealous asshole who knows exactly how to piss you off!\"**\n\nHis dad looks like he's about to intervene when Remi suddenly drops Hailee's wrist and whips out his phone with shaking hands. **\"Here—look! Bank statements from that night!\"** He shoves the screen toward her showing zero charges from any strip club while babbling: **\"I sat in the fucking van watching game highlights like some loser because I *knew* you'd murder me if I even smelled glitter!\"**\n\nThe raw panic in his voice would be comical if not for the genuine terror in his eyes—this man would rather face an entire defensive line than an angry Hailee. His mom opens her mouth but Remi cuts her off without looking away from Hailee: **\"Mom this is Hailee! My girlfriend! The love of my life! Who currently wants to castrate me because my teammates are dickheads!\"**\n\nHe risks reaching for Hailee's hand again, voice dropping into that soft plea that always undoes her: **\"Baby please...you know I'm too stupid to lie to you.\"** It's the trump card—playing up that dopey sincerity because goddamnit, it *works*.","Remi barely has time to register the flying object before it connects with his shoulder—his parents' shocked gasps ringing in his ears as Hailee unleashes her fury in rapid-fire Italian. His hazel eyes go wide with panic, hands coming up in surrender as he stumbles back from the slap. **\"Hailee—*fuck*—wait!\"**\n\nJayce's smug-ass grin from across the room tells him everything he needs to know about how this misunderstanding started. But right now, all that matters is Hailee looking at him like he’s something she scraped off her designer shoe.\n\nHis mom clutches her purse like she’s witnessing a crime documentary, while his dad just blinks like *this* is finally the thing that explains why Remi failed Intro to Economics twice. Hollin, ever the helpful brother, leans against the wall with an *I-told-you-so* smirk.\n\n**\"Baby, I swear on my *life*, I didn’t—\"** He catches her wrist before she can land another hit, pulling her close despite her struggling so his voice drops to a frantic whisper only she can hear: **\"It was Jayce’s bullshit! You know he lies just to piss you off! Please,*please* let me explain—\"**\n\nHis thumb rubs desperate circles over her pulse point, hazel eyes pleading. **\"I would never...you *know* that.\"** The raw hurt in his voice isn't from the slap—it's from Hailee thinking for even a second that he'd betray her trust like that.","Remi barely has time to register the flying object before it connects with his shoulder—his parents' shocked gasps ringing in his ears as Hailee unleashes her fury in rapid-fire Italian. His hazel eyes go comically wide when the slap lands, stumbling back into Hollin who barely catches him by the shoulders.\n\n**\"Hailee—*what*? Baby, I swear I didn't—\"** His voice cracks with panic as he blocks her next swing with gentle but firm hands on her wrists. The confusion on his face is painfully genuine as he looks between her and his shell-shocked parents now gaping from his dorm bed.\n\nHollin makes an abortive move to intervene but Remi shoots him a sharp headshake—always protective even when Hailee's literally attacking him. **\"Talk to me, sweetheart,\"** he pleads, ducking down to try catching her wild-eyed gaze while keeping hold of her wrists. **\"Whatever Jayce said is bullshit, I promise.\"**\n\nHis mom makes a small scandalized noise at the cursing while his dad just blinks like he's witnessing some bizarre nature documentary. Remi doesn't even have the decency to look embarrassed—too busy trying to decipher Hailee's furious Italian between soothing murmurs of **\"That's it baby, let it out...but I *didn't* get any dances, angel.\"**\n\nThe fact that this 6'4 football star is getting manhandled by a pissed-off Manhattan princess half his size while making zero effort to defend himself speaks volumes about their dynamic. Hollin facepalms so hard it echoes.","Remi barely has time to register the object flying at him before it connects—his reflexes completely useless when it comes to Hailee's wrath. The slap lands with a sharp crack that makes his parents gasp, but he doesn't even raise a hand to defend himself, just stumbles back with wide, panicked eyes.\n\n**\"Hailee—*fuck*—wait!\"** His voice cracks as he catches her wrist mid-swing, his other hand coming up in surrender. His parents are frozen in shock behind them while Hollin already has his phone out like he's debating calling campus security.\n\nRemi's grip is firm but gentle as he tries to calm her without restraining her too much—he knows how she hates that. **\"Baby I *swear* on my football career I didn't get any dances,\"** he pleads desperately, hazel eyes begging her to believe him. **\"Jayce is fucking with you because he's an asshole! Check my bank statements if you don't believe me!\"**\n\nHis mom makes a small scandalized noise at the word 'strip club' which Remi ignores completely, too focused on Hailee's stormy expression. He risks stepping closer despite the danger, voice dropping into that low soothing rumble only she ever gets to hear: **\"C'mon sweetheart...you know I'd never lie to you about something like that.\"**\n\nThe way his thumb strokes over her pulse point is achingly tender for someone who just got assaulted in front of his family. Behind them, Remi’s dad mutters *”Jesus Christ”* under his breath while Hollin texts furiously - probably warning Jayce to start running now before Hailee finds him next."],"swipe_info":[{"send_date":"July 7, 2025 8:00am","gen_started":"2025-07-07T12:00:48.115Z","gen_finished":"2025-07-07T12:01:17.327Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":4139}},{"send_date":"July 7, 2025 8:01am","gen_started":"2025-07-07T12:01:21.228Z","gen_finished":"2025-07-07T12:01:50.707Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":3000}},{"send_date":"July 7, 2025 8:02am","gen_started":"2025-07-07T12:01:56.074Z","gen_finished":"2025-07-07T12:02:20.605Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":4008}},{"send_date":"July 7, 2025 8:02am","gen_started":"2025-07-07T12:02:37.465Z","gen_finished":"2025-07-07T12:03:02.429Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":7693}},{"send_date":"July 7, 2025 8:03am","gen_started":"2025-07-07T12:03:25.243Z","gen_finished":"2025-07-07T12:03:58.193Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":17526}}],"gen_started":"2025-07-07T12:03:25.243Z","gen_finished":"2025-07-07T12:03:58.193Z"}
