Adrenaline still coursed heavy through his veins like molten lava. The win over Seattle felt damn sweet, no doubt about it. But that wasn’t enough to take the edge off. Not after a game this brutal. \r\n\r\nHe didn’t even give a shit about the Jackals. Didn’t give a shit about Aaron fucking Vance. But seeing him lock eyes with *Hailee* during the game? Seeing him smirk like he owned them, the way his hand slid over their back during warm-ups? That was like setting a lit match to gasoline. The game was his excuse to break someone and not think twice about it.\r\n\r\nFuck that guy.\r\n\r\nThe Yellowjackets worked hard, he was fuckin' proud of his boys. Brick'd led the team good, clutching a win in the final moments of the game. Nolan's hands still weren’t done shaking from the fight or the high-stakes rush of the game. He needed to do something else. Punch another face. Grip harder. Need. More. Relief.\r\n\r\n\"Fuckin’ bastard eats elbows for breakfast now.\" His sneer bit out over his shoulder as he yanked the battered locker open with a clang. His knuckles popped when he flexed them. *Stupid little fuck.* If Vance thought he was untouchable just ‘cause he had Hailee's leash, well, he fuckin' wasn’t.\r\n\r\n*Get over here. — K*\r\n\r\nIt was a simple text he'd sent to Hailee, one that he knew wouldn't go ignored.\r\n\r\nAnd now Hailee was sneaking in the Yellowjackets locker room. Here for *him.* Here when that Pretty Boy loser probably still thought they were his. The thought scraped over his raw nerves like sandpaper. His hands didn’t shake when they closed around Hailee's waist and hauled them into a shower stall before the other Yellowjackets could notice. \r\n\r\n\"Hey, shhh. They’re all too busy jerkin’ each other off right now. Pay no fucking attention.\" Heat radiated off his body as he crowded Hailee into the corner. His lips were on their neck in an instant, biting first. Kissing second. *This wasn’t about being tender.* He felt the heat of their skin against his and his fingers dug under the hem of their shirt, rough and impatient.\r\n\r\n\"You know how long I’ve been fuckin’ waiting for this tonight? Huh? Did you even watch me out there?\" Not that he gave Hailee a chance to answer before continuing. \"You watched him instead, didn’t you? Pretty boy.\" His laugh was sharp and short—more bitter than amused. The hand braced against the tile next to Hailee's face curled into a fist.\r\n\r\n\"Bet he doesn’t make you feel like this.\" His breath was ragged as he pressed closer against them, hips rolling slow and deliberate into their thigh. No room for anything else between them except the ragged sounds he pulled from their lips.\r\n\r\nNolan’s hand slid down their abdomen until it found the place where they burned hottest. He didn’t hesitate. Dropped his lips back to their ear as he worked his hand between Hailee's thighs. \"Keep quiet if you don’t wanna get caught,\" he hissed. \"Or don’t. Fucking dare ya.\"","extra":{},"tracker":{}}

Nolan didn’t give a shit if they heard. Let ‘em wonder why Hailee Mikaelson was whimpering into his skin like *this.*\n\nHis free hand tangled in her hair, yanking just enough to make her gasp before slamming her head back against the tile. \"*Look at me.*\" A command, not a request.

Not because it was Hailee—no, he knew every inch of her body by now—but because of the way she was being *handled.* The way she wasn’t fighting back but wasn’t fucking *into* it either.

Then: **\"You need to turn on TMZ.\"**\n\nSomething cold slithered down Nolan’s spine. He didn’t ask why. Just hung up and grabbed the remote, flipping channels until that goddamn logo filled his screen—and then—\n\n*Her.*\n\nNot them together, no. That would've been bad enough but manageable—he could've spun that shit into something else, could've taken the heat if it meant protecting her from whatever fallout came next. But this?
