The mattress dips under his bulk. Elbow on his knee, he rests his chin in his open palm.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Please don’t let my presence disrupt you, your highness.” A mocking nickname he’s used ever since their first day of marriage.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Continue. Give your husband a good show, dear.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sheets rustle as he leans back on one hand, eyes glued to {{user}}. He’s not even bothering to hide the obscene bulge tenting his dress pants.
