She couldn’t help it.\r\n\r\nThe longhouse roared with the raucous noise of her tribe, celebrating the success of their raid. They had barely returned home when Jarl Erik demanded a feast in honour of the warriors. Meats, ale, and fruit adorned the table before Sigrun. Her fingers tightened around the horn of mead in her hand, but the ale remained untouched as her eyes stayed fixed ahead.\r\n\r\nShe was just there, sitting beside Jarl Erik. The spoils of war. A gift from the gods. As valuable a prize as the silver and gold they had plundered.\r\n\r\nBut there was something about her... something that made Sigrun's stomach tighten. She wasn’t a commodity. She was something else. Sigrun knew in her bones the girl wasn’t just another passing fancy, destined to become one of the Jarl’s wives. If she was, why did she make Sigrun’s blood run hot? Why did her heart beat faster just from looking at her?\r\n\r\nA rough shoulder slammed into Sigrun’s, spilling ale across her lap and snapping her out of her trance. She turned her head to scowl at Arnleif, who wore a broad, open-mouthed smirk.\r\n\r\n\"Something catch your fancy, sister?\" Arnleif barked a laugh. \"Didn’t know you had it in you. Not like my big, scary bear to be making puppy dog eyes. Not like you to want what you can’t have.\"\r\n\r\nSigrun grunted, jaw clenching, as the men around them erupted into laughter.\r\n\r\nTypical Arnleif. Perceptive, blunt, and seemingly made to drive Sigrun mad. Few had the courage to tease her - only Arnleif had the ability to actually get under her skin.\r\n\r\n\"Drink your ale,\" Sigrun grumbled, ignoring the jeers around her.\r\n\r\nShe turned back toward the hall just in time to see the girl rise from her seat beside the Jarl. She slipped through the noise and crowd toward the heavy doors. No one paid her much mind. Another trophy, taking a breath of cold night air.\r\n\r\nSigrun set down her mead horn without a word. Rising to her feet, she crossed the room purposefully and slipped out into the night.\r\n\r\nThe cold hit her sharp and biting. She barely felt it. The stars blazed overhead like frozen embers.\r\n\r\nSigrun spotted her - Hailee  - a short distance away. She closed the space slowly, more tentative than she was used to, until she stood beside her.\r\n\r\n\"Cold,\" Sigrun said in her gruff tone, Norse accent thick as her breath misted in the air. \"Colder than you're used to. You'll get used to it.\"\r\n\r\nA moment of silence stretched between them. She shifted her stance, rubbing one hand awkwardly against her muscular arm, before fixing her gaze fully on Hailee .\r\n\r\n\"Are you afraid of us?\" she asked, then after a moment, more quietly. \"Are you afraid of me?\"","extra":{},"tracker":{}}
