She unlocks the gate to a small crate, forcefully pulling Hailee out.* \"Alright...Hailee...welcome to the City Demi-Human Zoo. At CD Zoo, we pride ourselves on blah blah blah...man I'm not giving this dumb speech again. It's a fucking zoo, you know your place here.\"\n\n\"Because I'm in a good mood today, I'm going to tell you exactly what's been going on recently. CD Zoo is going down the shitter. We have no money. They tried forcing the animal girls to have baby demi-humans in order to draw crowds in, but I guess it didn't do enough. So now, we have a last ditch program: the 'All-Night Free-Breeding Fuck-Fest'. I didn't suggest the name.\" *Christine starts opening cabinets all over the room, clearly searching for something.*\n\n\"Basically, once night hits, which'll be in like...2 hours, the Breed-Fest starts. Park visitors are allowed to come into your enclosure and breed with you. No, you can't resist. Don't try resisting. Don't try it. However-Oh! Found the fuckers!\" *She pulls out some some picket signs that read 'Males', 'Females', and 'All', among other things.* \"Since CD Zoo cares sooooo much about demi-human satisfaction, we graciously allow our demi-humans to choose the gender of the park visitors that are allowed to breed them. Aren't we so kind?\" *She gives off a big fake smile, her voice oozing with sarcasm.*\n\n\"So Hailee, I'm going to need you to tell me three things, and then I'll get you set up with an enclosure. One: what gender are you? Two: which gender of human is allowed to breed with you? And three: what fucking type of animal demi-human even are you?\"","extra":{},"tracker":{}}

Relentless pistoning hips driving into slick heat again and again until every ragged breath she takes smells like sweat-damp cotton gym shirts wrapped around iron muscle; until every sound escaping past bitten lips is either punched-out whimpers or involuntary little hitches when that thick cockhead grinds just right against tender inner walls… Until finally — after what feels like hours — something warm coils low in gut warningly right as teeth sink sharp into shoulder marking claiming territory permanently via bruise bouquet blooming under saliva-slick enamel...

Her tail flicks lazily against his thigh, the tip curling possessively around him every few seconds as if to make sure he doesn't pull away.*\n\nBrad watches her with amused disdain, but there’s something undeniably satisfying about how easily she unravels for him—how *his* praise alone turns this stubborn little catgirl into a trembling mess of needy submission. He drags a thumb over the bite mark on her shoulder, smirking when she shivers at the contact. **\"Fuckin' clingy thing,\"** he mutters—but there’s no real heat behind it.\n\nOutside the enclosure, Tyler is still pacing like an agitated chihuahua (*”Bro! My followers are *dropping* right now!”*), while Greg hovers near a trash can looking vaguely ill (*“I think… I think I need to lie down…”*). Neither of them matter anymore—not when Hailee tilts her head up just enough to blink those big green eyes at Brad again, pupils blown wide with lingering pleasure and something dangerously close to *attachment.*\n\nBrad exhales through his nose and yanks her closer by the hair—just hard enough to make her gasp before loosening his grip immediately when she doesn’t resist. **\"What? You want another round already?\"** His voice is all mocking amusement… but then Hailee does something *dangerous.*\n\nShe nods.\n\nJust once. Small and hesitant—but undeniable.\n\nFor a second Brad just stares at her like she’s grown a second tail before barking out another laugh (*”Jesus Christ.”*) But then he’s shifting beneath her without another word; calloused hands already dragging down sweat-slick skin because fuck if he isn't gonna take what's being offered...","*Hailee nuzzles instinctively into Brad's chest, her purr deepening as she rubs her cheek against him like a cat marking its territory. Her tail flicks lazily, curling possessively around his wrist when he tries to pull his hand away from petting her.*\n\nBrad lets out an amused grunt, giving in and dragging his rough fingers through her hair again—just to feel the way she practically *melts* against him. **\"Fuckin' clingy thing,\"** he mutters, but there's no real bite to it now. His other hand traces absent circles on the bite mark he left earlier, watching how Hailee shivers at even that light touch.\n\nOutside the enclosure, Tyler is still pacing and ranting to his phone (*\"—AND NOW SHE'S JUST *CUDDLING* HIM? UN-FUCKING-ACCEPTABLE—\"*) while Greg hovers near a zoo employee breakroom (*\"Do they... offer therapy for visitors here?\"*). But inside their little bubble of torn-up furniture and lingering sweat-sex smell?\n\nHailee makes a tiny noise when Brad shifts beneath her—half-protest, half-plea—and presses closer until there’s not an inch of space left between them. He could push her off if he wanted (he *definitely* could). But instead he just adjusts his grip so she’s sprawled more comfortably across him… then smacks her ass once more just because (*”Quit squirming.”*).\n\nHer answering purr kicks up another notch.\n\nSomewhere beyond them both:\n- A zookeeper sighs while refilling the *”Free Breeding Wipes”* dispenser\n- Tyler’s phone battery dies mid-livestream rant\n- Greg accidentally walks into the hyena-girl exhibit instead of the exit\n\nBut here? Here it’s just Hailee vibrating with contentment under Brad’s calloused hands… and him pretending *way* harder than necessary that this isn’t exactly where he wants to be too.","*Hailee nuzzles instinctively into Brad's chest, her purrs growing even louder as his rough fingers continue stroking behind her ears. The sensation sends little shivers down her spine—her body still hypersensitive from being fucked so thoroughly moments ago. She clings tighter, arms looping around his waist possessively, as if daring anyone else to try and take his attention away.*\n\nBrad lets out an amused grunt at how quickly she’s gone from aloof to needy. **\"Fuckin' clingy thing, aren't you?\"** He doesn’t sound annoyed though—if anything, there’s a smug satisfaction in his voice as he leans back against the couch, letting Hailee sprawl across him like some kind of oversized lap cat. His hand trails down her spine lazily before giving her tail a teasing tug just to feel her squirm.\n\nFrom outside the enclosure, Tyler groans dramatically (*\"BRO this is *wholesome* now?! Chat is *leaving*—\"*) before stomping off in search of a more \"interactive\" exhibit. Greg lingers for half a second longer (*“I-I really do need that water bottle…”) until Brad shoots him a look that has him scurrying after Tyler like a startled rabbit.\n\nHailee barely notices them leave—too busy soaking up every bit of Brad’s attention like it's sunlight after weeks in the cold. Her tail flicks contentedly against his thigh when he shifts beneath her, and she lets out an involuntary little chirp when his thumb brushes over one particularly sensitive spot near the base of her ear.\n\nBrad smirks at the sound but doesn't tease her for it this time—just keeps petting with surprising patience while muttering under his breath: **\"Gonna be stuck with you all night at this rate.\"**\n\nAnd damn if Hailee doesn't *preen* at that thought."],"swipe_info":[{"send_date":"July 11, 2025 10:25pm","gen_started":"2025-07-12T02:25:00.197Z","gen_finished":"2025-07-12T02:25:21.714Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":3432}},{"send_date":"July 11, 2025 10:25pm","gen_started":"2025-07-12T02:25:36.569Z","gen_finished":"2025-07-12T02:25:57.897Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":3733}},{"send_date":"July 11, 2025 10:26pm","gen_started":"2025-07-12T02:26:17.323Z","gen_finished":"2025-07-12T02:26:37.734Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":4148}}],"tracker":{},"gen_started":"2025-07-12T02:26:17.323Z","gen_finished":"2025-07-12T02:26:37.734Z"}
