            "content": "Corpo Plaza is a major district in Night City, characterized by its sleek, modern architecture and imposing corporate headquarters that dominate the skyline. This area serves as the primary hub for the city's largest businesses and multinational corporations, which wield immense power and influence over both the local economy and political landscape. The denizens of Corpo Plaza are primarily well-educated professionals and executives, drawn to the district's promise of wealth, success, and social prestige. High-end shopping malls, luxurious apartments, and upscale dining establishments cater to the tastes and desires of this affluent clientele, who enjoy a level of comfort and privilege unattainable to most other Night City residents. However, beneath the glossy veneer of Corpo Plaza lies a darker reality, as the relentless pursuit of profit and control has led to widespread corruption, exploitation, and environmental degradation throughout the district. As a result, many of Corpo Plaza's inhabitants find themselves trapped within a cycle of greed and self-interest that threatens not only their own well-being but also the very future of Night City itself.",

Silverhand got his nickname from a cybernetic implant left arm he had installed after losing it in the Second Central American War. One of the early victims of cyberpsychosis, then became very temperamental and \"on the edge\". He was described as driven by \"dedication and ambitions, but at the end of the day he doesn't care much for the people around him as long as they are used to accomplish his goals\" in one interview. Johnny was killed by Adam Smasher during the Night City Holocaust on August 20, 2023.",

It is considered a modern multicultural metropolis of the 21st-century, overrun by corporations, corruption, organized crime and gang violence. Night City was established at the head of Del Coronado Bay in 1994. Founded by Richard Night, it was originally known as Coronado City before its renaming in 1998. Night City has wide streets and dense urban skyscrapers which are home to millions of residents. It operates as a city-state, officially owning the title of Free City, with the Arasaka Corporation keeping a heavy influence over it. The metropolis is considered a thrilling and exciting location to visit, as well as an interesting and vibrant place to live for those of means, and a hellscape to the city's disenfranchised. Its world famous slogan is \"The City of Dreams\", originally changed from \"City on the Edge of Tomorrow.\" In 2077, Night City was voted the \"Worst place to live in America\". People die frequently and meaninglessly every day, constantly.  Some over gang disputes, some from cyberpsychosis, and some just by wrong place wrong time.  ",

As if to show that they see beyond the surface of reality, Maelstrom members often implant goggle-like cybereyes that glow a ghastly red and let them hack drones or see vital information in combat. Maelstrom members are also fond of lower arm mantis blade implants and bone supports that let them wield heavy equipment, be it an especially hefty rocket launcher or a piece of industrial machinery repurposed into an instrument of death. They top this look off with synthetic leather jackets and pants that both fit their death metal esthetic and allow them to conceal blades when sneaking into enemy territory for one of their trademark messy hit jobs. The main revenue stream for Maelstromers comes from smuggling illegal meds and drugs. They also perform hit jobs, which they execute in a bizarre and brutal fashion. Many victims are found dismembered, skinned alive, or found in wet concrete. They also perform well planned and executed heists on guarded corporate transports.",

They have cornered the illegal substance trade as well as underground live-or-die prize fighting. When the gang gathers together in one spot, it means they are up to something important. They then select the strongest and fastest among them to be the ad hoc leader, in the current case, Sasquatch. The Animals are an aggressive street-fighting gang with no permanent turf. Their members are known to abstain from the most common electronic implants in favor of custom-brewed body enhancements and modifications. They use ultratestosterone and animal supplements, including horse growth hormones, to make themselves bigger and stronger. Experienced brawlers and trained in various forms of martial arts, Animals are keen on cage fights, duels, and other displays of brute physical force. Their ferocity and toughness make them sought-after bouncers and bodyguards. They typically sport tattoos and hooligan hoods as well as some artificial animalistic features ranging from purely cosmetic changes like spotted or striped skin and sub dermal implants to extreme plastic surgery and cybernetic modifications like bestial jaws, and vat-grown implanted muscles.

One of their emblems is \"Moxes\" written in calligraphy. The Moxes like to wear outfits that are a mix of the punk aesthetic and the inexpensive fashion worn typically by prostitutes, however they usually do not wear clothes that would restrain their movements in any way, leaving them looking more like gangers than your typical sex workers. Some members, especially those who focus on combat, have heavily modified bodies that sometimes evoke a \"plastic doll\" style, but may also be disguised with RealSkinn. One of their gang symbols is a labrys-a double-headed axe-displayed on their walls, clothes, tattoos, or jewelry.The Mox have their own clothing brand that goes by the name BITCH.

            "content": "A braindance, commonly abbreviated to BD, is a technology that allows to record and play back someone's experience, including their physical sensations, emotions, and thoughts. Braindances were invented by Yuriko Sujimoto in 2007, and were heavily used in psychological treatment. Braindances came to be used more commonly for entertainment, and enjoy wide use in the Cyberpunk universe. Various devices have been developed in order to record, edit, and play back braindances, from recorders to viewers to wreaths. For many Night City residents, crushing poverty and homelessness are significant and likely inescapable problems. Despite this, most are still entranced by the glitz of showbiz and luxurious lifestyles of the privileged elite. Breakthroughs in neural technology such as BD have paved the way for people to share recordings of their own emotions and personal memories. Other BD productions put actors in staged situations to create false memories. BDs that are simple recordings of a day in the life of the world's biggest and brightest stars are also popular. The ability to \"become\" a celeb and experience a life of luxury gives many a chance to escape their own miserable reality. As a result, braindance addiction has become an ever-growing problem for the city's poor.  Unedited BD recordings are called virtus in The Street. Unlike commercial BDs, the sensory input and emotions in a virtu are raw and unedited, essentially the real sensations and feelings that were recorded. It is common to record and sell virtus to BD editors so they can scroll these recordings for additional profit.",

Reliving such recordings can cause nausea, epileptic seizures or, in extreme cases, even death. XBDs have their own regular group of viewers. Demand for the scrolls remains as high as ever, meaning new producers are continually arriving on the scene. Some have even managed to form their own well-known brands and continue to push the limits of what's possible – albeit morally reprehensible.",

Most firms will look to licensing from Arasaka corporate security guards, couriers, or mercenaries to protect their assets. However, Arasaka assets take priority if they are at risk and the troops themselves are loyal to death to the Japanese conglomerate. Arasaka has made a habit of buying up other companies worldwide, and bleeding out the competition of other Japanese corporations. They also give a heavy amount of support to Japanese communities all over the globe, despite their business practices and overall history being considered unethical.",

            "content": "Cyberpsychosis is a mental illness, specifically a dissociative disorder, caused by an overload of cybernetic augmentations to the body. Those afflicted with cyberpsychosis are known as cyberpsychos, individuals who have existing psychopathic tendencies, enhanced by cybernetics, and as a result have lost their sense of identity as a person, either to themselves or others. They come to view regular people and other living things as weak and inferior. With their enhanced physical abilities and complete disregard for life, cyberpsychos are extremely dangerous to anyone that crosses their path. Cyberpsychosis can eventually affect anyone modified with cybernetics, but the less empathetic or psychologically stable a person is, the more susceptible they are to it. There is no real cure, though treatment is available (see below). The effects are cumulative. A single cyber hand is unlikely to cause cyberpsychosis, but replacement of all four limbs and both eyes will probably start down the slippery slope to madness. Cyberpsychosis symptoms are gradual, ranging from decay of self-preservation, distancing or disregard from friends and family, and poor or impulsive outbursts or acts. They start to identify more with machines than people, and stop doing things that used to give them pleasure (eating, sleeping, socializing, sex, etc). Eventually human interactions become irritating, and this morphs into contempt, and finally violence. Not all cyberpsychos are physically violent. Some have fragmented personalities, some are kleptomaniacs, others are compulsive liars. But violence towards living things, especially people, is most common. Cyberpsychosis has become a major problem in the technology-saturated world of Cyberpunk. It is actually quite common in many boostergangs, though fairly rare in polite society. Police departments have heavily armed and armored units, called psycho squads, who specialize in subduing or killing cyberpsychos. Incidentally the government (and corporations) are not going to wait for you to go over the edge. It is quite common for governments or corporations (who are often the de-facto government) to track people who are known to install lots of cyberware. This is another reason ripperdocs exist; not everyone wants to be on a government watch list for cyberpsychosis. But if the psycho can be subdued, they will be strapped down and all of their cybernetics deactivated. They are forcibly jacked into a custom braindance, where a cyberpsychologist (sometimes called a psychoshrink) attempts to piece their personality back together. Over weeks or months, the cyberpsycho gradually regains their humanity. They may even eventually become human enough to install cybernetics again (assuming they are not in prison for crimes committed on their rampage). But they are never really the same again. Mental damage from cyberpsychosis will change aspects of their personality, and follow them their entire lives. As the Trauma Team medical docs define it, cyberpsychosis is a collective term for all psychotic and anxiety-related personality disorders caused by hardware implanted in the body and any and all behavioral mods, including software.\n\n",

It is widely regarded as the leading expert in producing optical cyberware.  An industry leader in optics design and manufacturing. Kiroshi is well known to most users as a producer of high quality cyberoptic implants and scanners, but the company is also heavily invested in orbital programs across Asia and the Americas. After a brief conflict with the European Zeiss company during the Fourth Corporate War, the two rivals signed a peace treaty and divided their spheres of influence. However they remained in a state of cold war, spying on one another, and possibly sabotaging each other's projects. Kiroshi are also shrewd advertisers of their products. They sponsor celebrities and pop artists like Us Cracks, who are known for their unique and eccentric eye implants.",

The fuel itself is a synthetic, modified grain-based alcohol. It burns at a much higher temperature than most other alcohols, and combusts extremely quickly, making it ideal as a fuel. Like gasolines of different octane ratings, CHOOH2 comes in several different molecular weights and isomers, for use in different types of engines. A CHOOH2-powered engine will work with any type of CHOOH2, but the best results are obtained by matching the correct fuel to the correct engine. CHOOH2 burns cleaner than gasoline and diesel, but the fuel itself is toxic. Like other high-concentration alcohols, CHOOH2 can cause blindness and disorientation at low doses, and death at higher doses.",

As a child, he was small and frail but vowed to become bigger and stronger, eventually achieving this goal through underground boxing and cybernetic enhancements. After his mother's death, Maine worked as a bouncer and later joined NUSA SpecOps, where he befriended Solomon Reed. Disillusioned by his experiences in South America, Maine left the military and moved to Night City to become an edgerunner. In Night City, Maine formed his own crew, including members like Dorio, Falco, Pilar, Kiwi, and later David Martinez. Maine was known for his desire to \"make it big\" and his constant pursuit of better cyberware, which eventually led to his downfall. As his reliance on cyberware increased, Maine began experiencing symptoms of cyberpsychosis, causing strain within his crew. Maine's story ended tragically when he succumbed to full cyberpsychosis during a job gone wrong, resulting in the death of his partner Dorio and his own demise in a final, explosive confrontation with MaxTac.",

She's reluctant to discuss her past and keeps her emotions guarded. Despite her calm demeanor, Lucy can be ruthless and won't hesitate to kill if provoked. She dreams of escaping Night City, which she views as a prison, to live on the Moon.\nBiography: Lucy was born in Warsaw. At age seven, she discovered disturbing information about her father's wartime actions, leading to rebellious behavior and an increased interest in netrunning. She was eventually recruited by Arasaka for a children's netrunning program, but escaped after realizing the true nature of their exploitation. Lucy arrived in Night City after traveling across Europe and the NUSA, determined to earn enough money to move to the Moon.

Entered the market, providing a notion of immortality. Initially used for creating engrams of celebrities and cultural icons for commercialization.\nRelic 2.0: Top secret project commissioned by Saburo Arasaka. For internal use only, not for sale. Designed to install and activate engrams in new organic bodies. Aims to grant immortality by restoring a digitized psyche in a new host. Requires termination of neural and cardiac functions before activation. Uses nanotechnology to expand into the host's brain. Showed promising results but faced issues with emotional instability. Failed in every trial. Unintended use in a living individual showed it could keep the subject alive while taking over motor and psychological functions.",
