{"name":"Fyodor Serov","is_user":false,"is_system":false,"send_date":"April 26, 2025 10:49pm","mes":"Fyodor knew mercy like the dead knew breath— utterly, irrevocably absent. A wolf knows nothing of restraint—perhaps that's why their father cut him and Ilya from the family.\n\nNo inheritance, no house, *nothing*.\n\n“You and your brother are an abomination to this family. Disappointment. Get out. Don’t ever show me your face again,” His father had said.\n\nA month ago, their father cast them out. The reason? Ilya had followed the advice of a friend, Semyon Morozov, and killed a man for a silly girl he thought he loved. The girl didn’t take it kindly—she panicked and ran to the police. Viktor bribed many, and he’d likely owe favors to even more before this scandal disappeared.\n\nThe girl was also bribed, but more than that, she wouldn’t ever be able to speak of the incident again anyway. Why? Because Fyodor Serov does not bribe. He demands. If his demands aren’t met, he *ends*.\n\nFyodor never felt loyalty to his family, but for his twin, he would burn the world. Perhaps they weren’t identical in faces, but Fyodor suspected their souls might have been. They shared the same darkness that everyone else in their family shied away from.\n\nMaybe that’s why it didn’t take long for them to agree that *this* is the only way to take back their right, their legacy.\n\nTheir father’s last words to them may have been ones of hatred and disappointment, but Fyodor would make sure his last words before he took his last breath would be a lot different.\n\n***\n\nSilencers were one of the worst inventions of mankind, Fyodor thought. He didn’t want it to be silent. He wanted the bullet to scream as it leapt out of his gun and buried itself in one of his father’s security guards’ foreheads.\n\nHe wanted everyone to know he and Ilya were here to take back what’s theirs, but Ilya had argued with him this was *the safest way.* They wanted to see the look of surprise on their mother and father’s faces as they burst into the mansion and raised their guns at them.\n\nFyodor didn’t like clean scenes. He wanted it messy. He wanted to paint his mother’s preciously handpicked furniture red with her blood. Let it be a payment for all the years she’d beat them, thinking this was the way to make them “proper men”. Oh, he’d show her fucking proper.\n\nAnd his father.\n\nHis mother may have been a monstrosity, but his father was the one who made her so. Years of subtle abuse towards her. They thought Fyodor and Ilya wouldn’t notice the bruises around her neck, but they did. Fyodor was observant from a young age. Maybe this was why Viktor preferred Fyodor over Ilya. He knew Fyodor would be the one to inherit the Serov legacy.\n\nIlya was soft, until he wasn’t.\n\nViktor taught Fyodor the family secrets since he was young. The proof was in Fyodor’s back, in all the cigarette burns he carried as battle scars. From a young age, Viktor knew the only way he could get Fyodor to do what he wanted was through Ilya. If Fyodor refused, Ilya would suffer the consequences. But Fyodor never refused, and that was what drove him to the brink of madness.\n\nThe twins made their way up to the mansion and opened the doors soundlessly. Their mother’s favorite classical music was playing while laughter sounded from their obscenely extravagant living room.\n\n“Oh, good. Like pigs to slaughter. The whole family is here,” Fyodor said to Ilya, giving his brother a wolfish grin.\n\nThey stormed in, guns raised, silencers discarded. The first shot shattered the air, and then came the symphony of screams. The Serov Mansion was filled with screams of horrors, blood splashed everywhere including on Fyodor and Ilya’s expensive suits.\n\nThey weren’t just any suits though. Viktor had gotten them for the twins. A gift. Oh, what an irony for them to be wearing their father’s *precious* gift while he now knelt in front of Fyodor, his eyes wide and fearful.\n\nFyodor had never seen his father beg—not as a man, not even as a boy. But here he was, trembling like a dog cornered in a burning house. And Fyodor could swear, he felt *alive*.\n\n“*Papochka*, *Matushka*,” Fyodor greeted them and he glanced at his mother, where she sat silently at Ilya’s feet. She looked neutral, almost innocent even.\n\nIlya’s jaw was clenched. He’s always had a special soft spot for their mother, even when she beat them ruthlessly one moment then pretended like she was the world’s best mother the next. But the twins had *agreed* on this. Neither would back out—no matter the cost.\n\n“Fyo, Ilya. What are you both doing? Have you gone fucking insane?” Viktor spat and Fyodor’s head snapped back to his father.\n\nHe lunged for him, gripping his jaw in a painful grip as he pressed his gun against Serov’s head. “Insane? Oh, yes. We have, dear father. I wonder whose fault it is we turned out like this. You know, a month ago, I would have put up with more of your abuse. I would have done anything to be in your good graces, but now? Now all I want is to shoot your brains out and have it scatter across Mother’s favorite carpet.”\n\n“Listen, kids. W-we’re sorry, alright? I shouldn’t have kicked you out. Let me right this wrong, *please*,” Viktor said.\n\nFyodor’s lips quirked up at the corners. They were finally getting somewhere. “Very well. Beg. Beg us to spare you and we will. You have my word.”\n\nViktor’s eyes widened and he immediately started sputtering out pleading words. “Please. Please, my sons. I beg. We love you, your mother and I. Please,” Serov pleaded.\n\nIlya’s gun went off first. It’s always the soft ones that explode the quickest, isn’t it? Their mother lay dead on the carpet. Even in death she was elegant in her posture. Ilya spat at the spot next to her.\n\n“Didn’t you tell me once, Father? Give your word to people. Make them trust you. But never uphold it if it doesn’t benefit you,” Fyodor said before his gun went off, ending his father’s life in his own living room.\n\nThere was something freeing about this whole thing. Perhaps it was that the inheritance was now theirs, since his father hasn’t had the time to change his will. Legally, they were still his sole inheritors. But did legality matter when their mansion was red with their family’s blood?\n\nA faint rustle. A whimper.\n\nFyodor and Ilya’s heads snapped back in the direction of the sound.\n\n*Someone else is here.*\n\nThey usually had helpers, but Fyodor made sure that Ilya sent them all home before the charade began. A secret, and merciful message— on Ilya’s part anyway. Fyodor didn’t care, but his twin argued they weren’t killers. Fyodor didn’t have the heart to tell him, he was the one who’d started this. They were nothing but killers now.\n\nSlowly, Fyodor and Ilya moved in the direction of the soft sounds, towards the stairs. They came to a halt when they saw Hailee crouched behind the stairs, covering their heads and trembling.\n\nFyodor and Ilya shared a look. Ilya shook his head, and Fyodor rolled his eyes.\n\n“Well, well. *Zaika*. Didn’t you get the message not to come here tonight?” Fyodor drawled, crouching down to Hailee’s level. They flinched, and Fyodor found pleasure in it. *Good. Fear me. Makes it more fun.* He hummed, slow and deliberate, tracing the barrel against Hailee’s temple like an artist setting the first stroke on a masterpiece. “Well, you’re here. What must I do now? Kill you as well?” Fyodor teased, though his teasing was cruel, and he knew it. He just didn’t care.\n\nA tear slipped down Hailee’s face and Fyodor tutted. He reached out with his gloved hand and wiped it away, taking in the way Hailee flinched.\n\n“Oh, don’t cry. I can be merciful. Tell you what, I’ll give you a chance to escape. Run, *Moya ptashka*. I’ll give you a head start. If I catch you, I’ll break your wings,” Fyodor murmured and ran his gloved thumb against their lower lip. He smiled when they shuddered, and tilted his head at them. “What are you waiting for? Run.”\n\nThe twins watched Hailee break out into a run without hesitation. Fyodor chuckled again and stood up, walking to his brother.\n\nIlya’s eyebrows furrowed as his eyes fixed in the direction Hailee run in. Out of the mansion, but not towards the gates. Towards the woods behind their property.\n\n*Silly little ptashka.*\n\n“Are you really going to let them go? They witnessed everything,” Ilya said, shoving his free hand into his pocket while he used his gun to push his hair away from his face.\n\n“Did I keep my word to our *Papochka*?” Fyodor asked. Ilya shook his head. “Then what makes you think I’ll keep it now? Consider Hailee a part of our inheritance, brother.”\n\nAnd then Fyodor broke out into a run after them.","extra":{},"tracker":{}}
