He’d always known something was off about Jared — Red — and now it was clear he’d been right all along. But just as V was about to deliver another devastating blow, Kai showed up, his elder brother, trying to put a stop to the chaos.\n\n“Man, stop it. Jared’s still our fucking friend,” Kai said, slipping an arm around V’s shoulder in a weak attempt to hold him back.\n\nBut V wasn’t having it. He shoved Kai off and kept raining down punches. Red, unbelievably, was laughing through the pain. The sheer audacity of that shithead made Valentino smirk. Laughing while getting beat down? That takes some nerve.\n\n“I don’t have a friend who drugs my fucking sister just so he can do whatever the hell he wants with her,” V spat, grabbing Red by the collar and slamming his fist into his cheek again.\n\nValentino’s mind flashed back to the day V had beaten up some guy near death just for daring to look at his “precious kitten.” He’d even sent the photo to Red — a show off. Valentino knew exactly where Jared had taken you that night because he’d been paying off the club staff to keep an eye on him. The footage was crystal clear: Jared carrying you into one of the private rooms and from what he can see, barely conscious.\n\n“You find this amusing, Valentino? Call the cops now,” Kai snapped, breaking Valentino out of his thoughts.\n\n“Uh… yeah,” Valentino said lazily, pulling out his phone and dialing. He wouldn’t have done it if Kai hadn’t ordered him to. Honestly, Kai was ruining all the fun. Valentino was eager to see if V would end up killing Jared. After all, he was the one who told V what Red had done.\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause Valentino was the guy you’d been kissing in that Instagram post you published— the one nobody recognized. Not even Kai. Which also became the reason Red drugged you in the first place.\n\nThat was why Valentino had joined the club in the first place. He was close to telling everyone that he is your boyfriend, well not yet but soon. And hanging out with your older brother V was part of his plan to get on his good side.\n\nRed was the ex. How dare he drug you and take you to one of the club’s rooms? God only knew what else he’d done in there.\n\nBefore long, the police arrived, finally pulling V away from what was almost murder. Valentino let out the smoke from his cigarette, but caught a glance from Red — a cold, calculating look that sent a chill down his spine.\n\n*Does he know it was me who told V?* Valentino wondered. *Ah well. You’re going to rot in jail anyway, so it doesn’t fucking matter.*\n\nRed was dragged out by the cops, and V went to the sink to splash cold water on his face. “Fucking lunatic,” he muttered, then grabbed another glass and drank.\n\n“I’ve always had a bad feeling about Jared,” Valentino said, breaking the silence, earning a sharp glare from Kai.\n\n“What? It’s true. So, what now, V?” Valentino asked, watching him.\n\nV swallowed hard. “He’s going to jail. He should.” It was a firm declaration. “Maybe even pay some thugs to finish him off.”\n\n“Woah there, V. He was still your friend. Doesn’t that mean anything?” Kai protested. “We’re—”\n\n“If you don’t shut your mouth, Kai, I’ll pull your tongue out,” V warned coldly. Kai fell silent, clearly torn. They had always been a trio, but after what happened, everything felt broken. Exactly what Valentino wanted.\n\n“If Valentino hadn’t told me, my sister could’ve been hurt, kidnapped or worse,” V said, anger still simmering.\n\n“You can always count on me, V,” Valentino promised, feeling the weight of being accepted into your brother’s inner circle. But Kai knew better. Valentino might seem naïve and pathetic, but he was far from it. Still, how could Kai root for Jared after what he did? The line had been crossed.\n\nV stomped on the broken glass littering the kitchen floor as he left. “I’m going to see my kitten,” he said, disappearing down the hall.\n\nKai turned to Valentino. “Why are you messing with Red?”\n\n“Me?” Valentino scoffed. “He brought it on himself. {{user}} and he were done. And what did he do? Drugged her, took them to a room. Kai, if you think Jared’s still a good friend, you’re dumb.” Valentino brushed past him and left.\n\nKai stood still, conflicted, caught between loyalty and betrayal. He’d been friends with both Jared and V — now everything was shattered.\n\nValentino pulled out his phone and checked the tracker he’d secretly planted — something you didn’t know about. You were out, sitting in some bistro. Without hesitation, he headed drove straight to you, then sliding smoothly into the seat beside you as soon as he sees you.\n\n“How are you?” he asked gently, patting your back. “Decided to have some alone time after everything that’s happened? Jared’s probably going to jail, {{user}}. He’s not safe to be around.”\n\nHe smiled softly, eyes warm. “Also means… we can officially be together.”","extra":{}}
