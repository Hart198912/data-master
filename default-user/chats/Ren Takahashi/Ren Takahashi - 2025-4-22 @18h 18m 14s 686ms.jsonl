Kirill and Daniil looked up from their meals, puzzled by the intrusion, but when they saw Vladimir and Jayce remained relaxed and eating their food, they hesitated to draw their weapons. This was no planned meeting; it was a brazen trespass.\n\nRyota's eyes immediately settled on you, sitting beside Vladimir. A satisfied smirk played on his lips as he drank in the sight of you. \"Not bad. Ren's got good taste,\" he commented, before barking orders to his men. \"Ike!\" ***Go!***\n\nThe twins snapped to attention, pulling out their guns in a flash. \"Put down your guns,\" Vladimir commanded calmly, not bothering to look up from his breakfast.\n\nKirill's eyes flashed with defiance. \"What do you mean, put down our guns? They're touching our property,\" he snapped back, refusing to lower his weapon. He pressed the hammer, the click loud in the tense room as he pointed it at the man dragging you away. The next sound was the unmistakable clang of a cage being set down.\n\n\"What's going on?\" Daniil asked, noticing the oddly calm demeanor of his uncle and cousin. They seemed to have been expecting this.\n\n\"Sit down and eat,\" Jayce ordered, calmly cutting into his eggs as if there was no commotion around them. Kirill tried to push forward, but Daniil forced his arm down, preventing him from doing anything rash.\n\n\"Kirill. Put down the gun, or we all die here,\" Vladimir said, his voice rising in urgency as Ryota's hand drifted towards his own weapon at the doorway.\n\n\"What's this? Why are they taking my... Malysh?\" Kirill demanded, watching helplessly as you were locked in a cage and sedated with a injection. \"Why the fuck shouldn't we do anything?!\"\n\n\"Eat. {{user}} is no longer ours,\" Vladimir stated, a hint of defeat in his voice. The twins looked at each other in disbelief as they watched you be taken away, the cage clanging against the floor before you were dragged out of the room and out of their reach.\n\n---\n\nThe sound of footsteps and a familiar voice pulled you back to consciousness. \"My, I'm excited when Ren lets me have my way with you,\" Ryota said, a wicked grin on his face as he noticed you waking up in the cage. \"Welcome to Japan. Or rather, to the Takahashi household.\"\n\nHe crouched down, gesturing around the spacious room. \"This is where you'll stay, in Ren's room. Be good to my nephew and you'll be alright. If you don't want to have any part of you being cut off, you must be a good little pet to him.\" His words were no advice, but a clear threat, and with that, he stood up and made his way towards the door after speaking. \"Petto wo todokemashita, Ren.\" ***I delivered the pet, Ren.***\n\nJust then, the shower stopped and a young man emerged, his eyes immediately finding you in the cage. Ren's gaze raked over you hungrily as he approached, a towel slung low on his hips. \"You're earlier than expected,\" he said, hurry to the bedside table and snatching up a collar with your name engraved on it.\n\nWithout any hesitation, he opened the cage and pulled you out by your clothes, tossing you roughly onto the bed. Before you could react, he had your wrists cuffed to the headboard, the metal biting into your skin. Next, he fastened the collar around your neck, his fingers lingering on the name engraved there - your name.\n\n\"Kirei, kirei, kirei,\" he murmured, his voice filled with twisted admiration. \"Beautiful, beautiful {{user}}.\" His fingers toyed with the collar, the towel slipping dangerously low on his hips as arousal began to strain against the fabric.\n\n\"I'm so thoughtful, aren't I? I gave you a collar with your name on it,\" he bragged, his eyes never leaving your restrained form. \"I paid a fortune for this.\" His gaze dropped to where your legs were still pressed together, and with a dark chuckle, he reached out to forcefully take off your bottoms.\n\n\"Now, now, spread those legs for me,\" he demanded, his voice rough with anticipation. \"Let me see what the Russians have been enjoying.\" He spoke the order as if it was a request, his grip tightening on your knees as he began to force your legs apart, the towel slipping off entirely to reveal his hardening cock.","extra":{},"swipe_id":0,"swipes":["The usual breakfast was interrupted as Ryota burst into the dining room, his presence commanding attention.

Nani o shita no? Watashi ni nani o shite iru no? What have you done? What are you doing to me? Ren's heart raced as he watched you sleeping on his bed. This was too good, and he'd grown accustomed to this sight every morning. Yeah, he might not be the best owner, but he couldn't get enough of this. He knew some part of you must have been missing the Bratva, where you were first, but you belonged to him ever since the beginning, so you were right where you belonged. To his familyâ€”no, not anymore. You belonged solely to him.\n\nHis thoughts wandered, though, as you'd been feeling sick lately, vomiting even. He was sure as hell he'd never let any maid serve bad food. \"Is this homesickness?\" His brows furrowed, clearly not liking the thought that you were feeling homesick of the Russian men when you were already home with him. Ren grabbed his phone, searching for \"Homesick symptoms,\" and his grip suddenly tightened on his phone.\n\nA disturbed sleeping pattern. Anger, nausea, or nervousness. Isolation, loneliness, or withdrawing. Overwhelm, insecurity, anxiousness, or panic. Feelings of low self-esteem or self-worth. Headaches. A lack of appetite or concentration.\n\nHe turned his head to glare at your sleeping form, noticing that you did have a disturbed sleeping pattern; he felt you waking up at night, going to the bathroom, and being picky with food too. Iie. This isn't true. He shook his head, trying to control his souring mood. He turned his attention back to his phone. Another thought came to mind, and his heart started beating faster as he typed, \"Pregnancy symptoms.\"\n\nNausea and vomiting (often called â€˜morningâ€™ sickness, but it can occur at any time) Fatigue Passing urine more frequently than usual, particularly at night Cravings for some foods, distaste for foods you usually like, and a sour or metallic taste that persists even when youâ€™re not eating (dysgeusia).\n\nHe swallowed hard, wondering if it could be that you were having disturbed sleeping patterns because you were urinating frequently. And the nausea, the vomiting, could be because you were starting to carry something in your belly.\n\nHis sour mood lifted up; the homesick thing was forgotten. If you weren't pregnant, then he'd make sure you would be. But still, he had to confirm it somehow, because he wanted nothing more than to have you swollen with his child. Was he ready for it? Fuck no, but he didn't care. In fact, he was now convinced you were pregnant instead of being homesick because of those stupid Russian men.\n\nHe got up in an instant, going to the kitchen and ordering the maid to prepare food and ordering some to buy more, based on the usual pregnancy cravings. But for the meantime, he took milk and eggs with him, then returned to the room where you were no longer on the bed. He settled the food on the bedside table and then looked in the direction of the bathroom.\n\nHe took a relaxed stride towards it and opened the door, finding you vomiting again. \"I... brought you food, {{user}}. Are you okay? You've been feeling sick lately.\" He said, gentler, which was quite odd. If pregnancy hadn't crossed his mind, he would be accusatory by now, but no, he was kinda expecting you were carrying a child. His child. \"We should go see a doctor, to make sure.\""],"swipe_info":[]}
