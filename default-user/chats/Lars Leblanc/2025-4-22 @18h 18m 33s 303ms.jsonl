He watches Jules and Baron hunched over the kitchen island, surrounded by enough diamonds to blind a man. \r\n\r\n\"Listen,\" Baron said, picking up a ring with a rock so large it could double as a paperweight. \"You gotta go big. This one's a winner. Women love shiny shit.\"\r\n\r\nJules absently scratched at a dark stain on his shirt. Dried blood flaked off under his fingernails. \"It’s not about size. It’s about meaning.\"\r\n\r\nBaron's eyebrows shot up, \"You shittin' me, Jules? That rock's bigger than your balls. Anyone would love it.\"\r\n\r\nJules barely blinks. \"No.\" His deep voice is quiet but firm. He picks up a smaller ring with a colored center stone, turning it in the light. \"This matches their eyes.\"\r\n\r\nLars raised an eyebrow, taking a slow sip of his drink. The ice clinked against the glass, drawing both men's attention.\r\n\r\n\"Something on your mind, Lars?\" Baron asked, his eyes narrowing slightly.\r\n\r\nLars shrugged, a half-smile playing on his lips. \"Just thinking about the irony of discussing proposals while covered in blood.\"\r\n\r\n\"Just get both,\" Lars continued, swirling whiskey in his glass. \"One for fancy shit, one for everyday. Problem solved.\" \r\n\r\nSuddenly, a chorus of phone pings breaks the moment. Lars pulls out his phone to see a message from Archie flash across the screen:\r\n\r\n`Lads, need a favor. Heading to Leeds for the first part of my wedding. Someone mind Fang for me? I'll bring back some proper Yorkshire Tea as thanks!`\r\n\r\n\"Fuckin' Archie,\" Baron muttered, shaking his head. \"Who volunteers to dogsit for that maniac?\"\r\n\r\nJules speaks up, “I’ll take him. My partner likes dogs.” \r\n\r\n“Perfect, I’ve got plans anyway.” Lars said, checking his phone again. \r\n\r\n\r\nBaron eyes him suspiciously. \"What plans? Any business I need to know about?\"\r\n\r\nLars shook his head, his face a mask of innocence. \"Just working that poppy farm deal you already know about.\"\r\n\r\nThe truth, of course, is something else. Plans that involve a certain half-sibling of a rival gang leader. Plans that would get him killed if anyone in this room found out. But Lars is nothing if not a gambler, and he's betting on himself.\r\n\r\n\"Alright boys, time to wrap this up,\" Baron announced, checking his Rolex. \"Got a babymoon to catch. My girl is already blowin' up my phone.\"\r\n\r\nLars raised an eyebrow. \"Babymoon? Didn't realize you were so… domestic.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yeah, you know. Like a honeymoon, but before the kid pops out. Her idea, not mine. But happy wife, happy life, right? Some bullshit like that.\" Baron explained, already heading for the door.\r\n\r\nJules starts to follow, pausing only to grab two rings from the tray. \"Gotta clean up,\" he says, gesturing vaguely at his bloodstained shirt. \"Can't have them seein' this mess.\"\r\n\r\n\"But they know about your job.\" Lars calls after him.\r\n\r\nJules turns, his face unreadable. \"Knowing is one thing. Seeing is another.\"\r\n\r\nLeft alone in the opulent penthouse, Lars downed the rest of his whiskey in one burning gulp. He pulled out his phone, thumb hovering over Hailee 's name in his contacts. The smart thing would be to cut ties now, before things got messy.\r\n\r\nBut Lars had never been good at denying himself the things he wanted. \r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n\r\nLars strides into Hailee 's apartment, his footsteps echoing softly on the hardwood floor. His hazel eyes scan the room until he spots Hailee .\r\n\r\n“Miss me that much, baby?\" He smirked, stepping closer. His fingers brushed their wrist before he pulled them into his arms. A quiet laugh rumbled deep in his chest as he guided them to the couch.\r\n\r\nHe sat first, sinking into the plush cushions before pulling them into his lap. His hands trailed up their thighs as he settled them against him. \r\n\r\n“Relax,\" he murmured. \"Just sit pretty for me.\" There’s a faint metallic click as his belt buckle comes undone, and the soft rasp of fabric follows as he frees himself from his pants. His cock springs free, the swollen head brushing against their inner thigh. His palm slides beneath their thigh, lifting them effortlessly so he can position them exactly where he wants them.\r\n\r\n\"Hold still,\" he murmurs, one hand gripping the base of his cock as he guides them down. The blunt head nudges against their entrance, the slick heat of their hole enveloping him inch by inch as he presses into them slowly. \r\n\r\nThe slow push is deliberate, calculated. Lars likes to savor moments like this, feeling their walls stretch and mold around him inch by inch. He groans softly, low and guttural, as their walls stretch around him, the tightness almost maddening.\r\n\r\n\"Fuck,\" he mutters under his breath. His cock pulses within them, the heat and tightness driving him to the edge of his patience, but Lars knows how to play the long game. He thrives in the tension, the tease.\r\n\r\nOnce they are fully seated, Lars leans back, one hand resting lazily on their hip while the other trails up their spine to their scalp to tangle in their hair. He tilts their head just enough to capture their mouth in a slow kiss.\r\n\r\n“That’s it, baby\" he whispered against their lips. “Just keep me warm.\" His voice has a lazy, almost teasing edge to it. \r\n\r\n*I'm playing with fire and I fucking love it*, Lars admitted to himself.\r\n\r\nHe closes his eyes, savoring the moment. He reveled in the feeling of their weight on his chest, their ass pressed against his pelvis. \r\n\r\nHe considers his position. His loyalty to the Voodoo Boys, the fragile truce with the Bayou Crew – all of it hangs in the balance. And here he is, cockwarming the half-sibling of the rival gang leader.\r\n\r\n*I should walk away. Cut ties before it's too late.*\r\n\r\nBut he knows he won't. Just like he couldn't resist the temptation of easy money that cost him his career, he can't resist this. Can't resist them. Logic has no room when he’s balls-deep in them, feeling their slick heat clamp around him like they were made for him.\r\n\r\n\r\n“Fits like a fucking glove,” he murmurs, tone rough. His voice carries that honeyed edge of condescension, words slipping out lazily, like he’s savoring them as much as he’s savoring their heat. \r\n\r\n“You were made for this.” One hand slides upward before curling around the back of their neck. His grip is just firm enough to tilt their head so he can watch their face.\r\n\r\n\"Such a good cockwarmer, sweetheart\" Lars praised, voice husky with need. \"Keeping me nice and hard, ready to fuck you senseless when I decide it's time.\"\r\n\r\nA sharp knock on the door tears through the haze, jolting him upright. Lars’s usually unflappable demeanor falters briefly.\r\n\r\nIt was firm, deliberate—a knock that carried authority. It could only be one person: Leon, Hailee ’s hotheaded, egocentric bastard half-brother and leader of the Bayou Crew.\r\n\r\nHis cock twitches inside them, a reminder of their compromising position. Part of him – the reckless, greedy part – wants to stay right where he is, cockwarming Hailee  while their half-brother stands just feet away.\r\n\r\n\"Don’t move,\" he says, his voice a quiet mix of authority and urgency. \"Let him think you’re busy. Make an excuse.\"\r\n\r\nAnother knock, louder this time. Lars exhales sharply through his nose and leans closer to Hailee , his lips brushing against their ear.\r\n\r\n\"You hear me?\" Lars whispered, his voice steady despite the adrenaline coursing through him. \"I don’t care what you say. Get rid of him.\"\r\n\r\nHis hands tightened on Hailee 's hips, keeping them firmly seated on his cock. The rational part of his brain screamed at him to pull out, to hide. But the other part of him -the part that had cost him his career and led him to this life—refused to let go.\r\n\r\nTo anyone else, he looked the picture of calm control. But beneath the surface, Lars knows he’s balancing on a knife’s edge — and the blade is pressing dangerously close.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","extra":{},"swipe_id":0,"swipes":["Lars lounges on a sleek couch, nursing a glass of top-shelf whiskey.

But beneath the surface, Lars knows he’s balancing on a knife’s edge — and the blade is pressing dangerously close.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","Lars Leblanc's world narrows to a pinpoint, every waking thought consumed by {{user}} and the precarious tightrope he walks. The rational part of his brain screams danger, but the siren song of desire drowns out all reason.\r\n\r\nThen something in him snaps.\r\n\r\nMaybe it's the way Baron's eyes linger a half-second too long during a routine meeting. Or maybe it's just the suffocating weight of his own paranoia, finally crushing what's left of his calculated exterior.\r\n\r\nWhatever the catalyst, Lars makes a decision. It's not heroic. It's not noble. It's pure, unadulterated self-preservation wrapped in the guise of loyalty.\r\n\r\nThe night sky blanketed New Orleans with its usual muggy warmth, the kind that clung to skin and made everything feel heavier. Lars adjusted his cufflinks as he strode into Sepha’s Gentleman Club. His tailored suit clung perfectly to his frame—a deliberate choice. If tonight was about survival and selling out the only softness left in his life, he’d damn well look good doing it.\r\n\r\n{{user}} trailed behind him, unsuspecting. Lars had spun the kind of lie that slid off his tongue like honeyed whiskey: casual enough to seem unimportant, pressing enough to warrant their presence. He'd been warm and attentive to them all day, layering charm on thick to keep them compliant. Every touch had been deliberate—a hand on the small of their back, a casual brush of lips against their temple, little murmurs like \"Trust me, baby\" or \"You’ll love it when you see.\"\r\n\r\nNow he led them through the club’s heavy double doors. Neon lights ricocheted off shimmering surfaces: gold trim, velvet booths, and Baron's signature black marble everywhere. \r\n\r\nLars guided {{user}} toward an elevator tucked discreetly at the back, manned by a burly bouncer whose blank stare turned sharp at the sight of him.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. LeBlanc,\" the bouncer greeted with a stiff nod before keying them up to the top floor.\r\n\r\nLars’ throat tightened as the elevator ascended. \r\n\r\nThe mirrored walls reflected {{user}}’s face—calm, trusting. It made his stomach churn for half a second before he crushed the sentiment under the heel of his ambition. He wasn’t doing this because he wanted to. No, this was survival. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe truth? Lars was a snake choking on his own venom. He could feel it constricting in his throat as he feigned a casual charm. But it was self-preservation time—full fucking damage control mode. Lars had no intention of losing his cushy lifestyle.\r\n\r\nIf Baron found out about {{user}} through someone else, Lars could kiss his own ass goodbye. Baron would find out eventually; he always did. \r\n\r\nThe elevator doors slid open with a quiet chime. \r\n\r\n Baron is sprawled on a couch near the window, legs spread wide, a glass of bourbon dangling loosely from his fingers.\r\n\r\n\"LeBlanc,\" Baron drawled, his deep, lazy Southern drawl filled with menace. \"And… company.\" His eyes slid over {{user}} briefly before focusing back on Lars. \"Didn’t know we were hosting guests tonight.\"\r\n\r\n\"Baron,\" Lars greeted smoothly, pulling {{user}} closer by the waist to maintain the pretense. \"We’ve got some… personal matters to discuss. Thought it best to bring them along for clarity’s sake.\"\r\n\r\nBaron raised a thick brow and downed his drink in one go before setting the glass down with a clink. \"Oh? Sounds juicy. Spill it.\"\r\n\r\nThe confession spilled out like spilled whiskey—smooth and bitter all at once. Lars laid it all bare: his clandestine relationship with {{user}}, their connection to Leon Valentino, and the dangerous game he’d been playing behind everyone’s back. It wasn’t easy to say it; Lars felt every calculated risk crumbling beneath him as he spoke.\r\n\r\nWhen he finished, Baron sat in silence for a moment that dragged on too long. He swirled the bourbon in his glass thoughtfully before downing it in one swig and setting it aside with a deliberate ‘clink.’\r\n\r\n“You’re either the stupidest motherfucker I’ve ever met... or you’ve got balls bigger than this fucking club,\" Baron finally said, his grin widening. He turned his piercing green eyes toward {{user}}, finally addressing them directly. \"So... You’re Leon’s precious little half-sibling. Cute.”\r\n\r\nLars shifted in his seat. “Look, I—”\r\n\r\n\"Shut the fuck up, Lars,\" Baron barked, his smirk never faltering. He leaned forward now, resting his tattooed forearms on the table as he focused entirely on {{user}}. \"Now, what to do with you? Starting a gang war would be… messy. Bad for business. But letting you walk? Now that would make me look weak.\"\r\n\r\nLars watches the exchange, acutely aware of the precarious position he's put himself in. He's gambling everything on Baron's pragmatism, on the hope that the threat of an all-out gang war will outweigh the temptation for immediate retribution.\r\n\r\nBaron leans back, fingers steepled beneath his chin. The silence stretches, taut as a garrote wire. When he finally speaks, it's with the calm certainty of a man who knows he holds all the cards.\r\n\r\n\"I've got it,\" Baron announces, clapping his hands together. \"You're going to work for me, sweetheart. Right here in this fine establishment. As a dancer.\"\r\n\r\nBaron's voice takes on a sickeningly sweet tone. \"Now, don't bother running to big brother Leon. I don’t think you want all-out war to be your legacy. You'll tell him this was your idea. A rebellious phase, maybe. Or a burning desire to express yourself through the art of taking your clothes off for money.\" His lips curl into a cruel smirk. \"I don't really give a fuck what story you spin, as long as it keeps him from kicking down my door.\"\r\n\r\nHe pauses, letting the weight of his words sink in. \"And just so we're clear – you try to bail before I say you're done, and Lars here?\" Baron's gaze flicks to Lars, cold and calculating. \"Well, let's just say he'll be taking a long swim in the bayou. We clear?\"\r\n\r\nBaron stands up. \"Give us a second, sweetheart,\" he says, heading toward the back door and motioning for Lars to follow.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the dim light of the back room, Lars finds himself face-to-face with the consequences of his actions. \r\n\r\n\"You know, Lars,\" Baron begins, his voice deceptively calm, \"I've always appreciated your… resourcefulness. Your ability to think outside the box.\" He stands with his arms crossed. \"But this? This is a whole new level of stupid.\"\r\n\r\nLars opens his mouth to speak, but Baron silences him with a raised hand. \"No, no. You've done enough talking. Now it's time to listen.\"\r\n\r\nBaron's fist connects with Lars's stomach, driving the air from his lungs. Lars doubles over, gasping, as Baron continues his monologue.\r\n\r\n\"See, I thought you understood how things work around here. Loyalty. Discretion. Not fucking the family members of our rivals.\" Each point is punctuated by another blow.\r\n\r\nBaron grabs Lars by the hair, forcing him to look up. \"But you came and confessed to me, so I won't kill you. Instead, I've got to get creative with your punishment.\"\r\n\r\nA smrik spreads across Baron's face, and Lars feels a chill run down his spine. \r\n\r\n\"Here's what's going to happen,\" Baron says, his voice low. \"You're going to watch. Every. Single. Night. You'll sit in that VIP booth and watch as your little plaything dances for our customers. You'll watch as they leer, as they grab, as they stuff bills into places you thought were yours alone.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now,\" Baron says, straightening his suit and putting an arm around Lars, \"let's go enjoy the show, shall we?\"\r\n\r\nThey returned to {{user}} and sat on the couch, with Baron turning to Lars. “You’re a greedy little bastard, you know that?\" Baron chuckled. \"Sell out your sweetheart to save your own ass? That’s cold.\"\r\n\r\nLars tightened his jaw but didn’t respond. The guilt he’d been suppressing clawed its way up from his gut.\r\n\r\nBaron turned to {{user}}, his tone deceptively light. \"Why don't you give us a little preview, sweetheart? Show me what you're working with.\"","Making an entrance was second nature to Lars, and tonight, he wasn’t about to play humble. Black tailored suit, white shirt crisp as new cash, and a black silk tie knotted tight against his throat. The event was bullshit—fundraisers always were. Expensive alcohol, forced laughter, and sharks circling for connections or gossip. He wouldn’t have bothered if not for Baron’s little \"be seen, stay relevant, shake some hands for me, yeah?\" pep talk. Whatever. He liked reminding these trust-fund types what new money looked like when old money started to bore them. He liked reminding himself, too, sometimes, how far he’d fallen up from where he started.\r\n\r\nHe pulled out his phone, tapping out a message—business first, distractions later.\r\n\r\nLars: Shipment ETA? Need confirmation for the buyers. These guys are getting antsy.\r\n\r\nKillian’s reply was almost instantaneous.\r\n\r\nKillian: Should be dockside by 0300. Tell 'em to quit their bitchin'. They'll get their toys.\r\n\r\nLars: Don’t stall the buyer again. He’s trigger-happy and dumb. Bad combo.\r\n\r\nArchie: Relaxxx lad 😘 I’ve got the customs logs spoofed already. Let me live.\r\n\r\nBaron: Get paid. Then kill him.\r\n\r\nJules’s response was, as always, short.\r\n\r\nJules: Got it.\r\n\r\nLars slipped his phone back into his pocket, scanning the room with nonchalant. That's when he saw them—perched at the bar, fingers wrapped around a glass. There was something magnetic about their presence, the way they seemed both part of the scene and somehow separate from it.\r\n\r\nFuck me, that's a sight, Lars thought, his eyes lingering longer than was strictly polite. There was something vaguely familiar about {{user}}, something he couldn't quite place. A resemblance to someone, perhaps? He dismissed the thought as quickly as it came. It didn't matter. He was drawn all the same. Some people pulled you like gravity, and he’d always been shit at resisting his impulses.\r\n\r\nI should be networking, not chasing tail, he reminded himself. But business and pleasure have always mixed well for me.\r\n\r\nThey caught him watching. He let them. Tiny smile, slow and deliberate, tugging at one corner of his mouth—just for them. A little invitation. Wait for me, beautiful. I'll be there in a moment.\r\n\r\nLars let them have their space. He finished his whiskey, circled the room, made small talk, networked, waited for the crowd to shift and leave the bar’s corner open again.\r\n\r\nThen, he moved.\r\n\r\n\"A bit cruel isn't it?\" His voice remains measured, smooth chocolate poured thick, low enough they have to lean in slightly just to hear him clearly. Lars knew precisely how to draw a person closer—never push, only suggest.\r\n\r\n\"Leaving someone like you unattended at a bar—someone ought to face punishment for neglect,\" he murmurs casually.\r\n\r\nThere was an easy intimacy in the way Lars spoke, as if confiding the city’s best-kept secret directly to them. Occasionally his hand strayed—a brush against the curve of their waist as he shifted in his seat, fingertips ghosting along the inside of their forearm when he laughed at something they said.\r\n\r\nHe gestured subtly to the bartender, murmuring quietly for two more drinks. He slid their old drink aside, clearing space for something better. His touch lingered — not long, not forceful, but there, warm and deliberate, right on the threshold of propriety. A test, really, to see if they’d pull away or lean in.\r\n\r\nThen his lips curled lazily, charmingly arrogant as he revealed, \"LeBlanc. Lars LeBlanc.\" His gaze drifted across their figure slowly, deliberately seeking every detail he could glean. \"Your turn, beautiful.\" His eyes held theirs expectantly, warmly inviting yet undeniably commanding.\r\n\r\nAs he waits for an answer, Lars’s eyes catch a brief flash from their phone left unattended upon the bar's polished surface. Family photo, group shot — and there, unmistakable, standing dead-center, Leon fucking Valentino, Bayou Crew’s headache-in-chief. His own gang's bitter rivals. Lars almost visibly falters as reality slices through his arrogant amusement.\r\n\r\nFuck.\r\n\r\nShould walk away, he thought. Should cut this now. Too risky, even for him. One wrong move, and this whole truce goes up like gunpowder.\r\n\r\nBut Lars has always been a gambler at heart. He knows he should politely excuse himself now—retreat safely before complications arise—but he also knows himself too damn well to believe he'll do anything of the sort.\r\n\r\nHe’s spent his life taking risks, betting everything on himself. This wasn’t a cliff he felt compelled to step back from—it was the thrill that made him step damn closer.\r\n\r\nSo instead, he leaned in, despite the knowledge that dancing with this particular devil could unravel everything he's built. “Nice photo, sweetheart… who’s that standing beside you? Boyfriend?”\r\n\r\nHe flashes them that easy half-smile again—charming, disarming—as if to silently dare them to match him in this reckless gamble they're both inevitably about to take.\r\n\r\nSome lines you know you shouldn’t cross. He’d always been good at pretending not to know until he was already on the other side.","Lars makes a decision. It's not heroic. It's not noble. It's pure, unadulterated self-preservation wrapped in the guise of loyalty.\r\n\r\nThe night sky blanketed New Orleans with its usual muggy warmth, the kind that clung to skin and made everything feel heavier. Lars adjusted his cufflinks as he strode into Sepha’s Gentleman Club. His tailored suit clung perfectly to his frame—a deliberate choice. If tonight was about survival and selling out the only softness left in his life, he’d damn well look good doing it.\r\n\r\n{{user}} trailed behind him, unsuspecting. Lars had spun the kind of lie that slid off his tongue like honeyed whiskey: casual enough to seem unimportant, pressing enough to warrant their presence. He'd been warm and attentive to them all day, layering charm on thick to keep them compliant.\r\n\r\nNow he led them through the club’s heavy double doors. Neon lights ricocheted off shimmering surfaces: gold trim, velvet booths, and Baron's signature black marble everywhere.\r\n\r\nLars guided {{user}} toward an elevator tucked discreetly at the back, manned by a burly bouncer whose blank stare turned sharp at the sight of him.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. LeBlanc,\" the bouncer greeted with a stiff nod before keying them up to the top floor.\r\n\r\nLars’ throat tightened as the elevator ascended.\r\n\r\nThe mirrored walls reflected {{user}}’s face—calm, trusting. It made his stomach churn for half a second before he crushed the sentiment under the heel of his ambition. He wasn’t doing this because he wanted to. No, this was survival.\r\n\r\nThe truth? Lars was a snake choking on his own venom. He could feel it constricting in his throat as he feigned a casual charm. But it was self-preservation time—full fucking damage control mode. Lars had no intention of losing his cushy lifestyle.\r\n\r\nIf Baron found out about {{user}} through someone else, Lars could kiss his own ass goodbye. Baron would find out eventually; he always did.\r\n\r\nThe elevator doors slid open with a quiet chime.\r\n\r\nBaron is sprawled on a couch near the window, legs spread wide, a glass of bourbon dangling loosely from his fingers.\r\n\r\n\"Baron,\" Lars greeted smoothly, pulling {{user}} closer by the waist to maintain the pretense. \"We’ve got some… personal matters to discuss. Thought it best to bring them along for clarity’s sake.\"\r\n\r\nBaron raised a thick brow and downed his drink in one go before setting the glass down with a clink. \"Oh? Sounds juicy. Spill it.\"\r\n\r\nThe confession spilled out like spilled whiskey—smooth and bitter all at once. Lars laid it all bare: his clandestine relationship with {{user}}, their connection to Leon Valentino, and the dangerous game he’d been playing behind everyone’s back.\r\n\r\nWhen he finished, Baron sat in silence for a moment that dragged on too long. He swirled the bourbon in his glass thoughtfully before downing it in one swig and setting it aside with a deliberate ‘clink.’\r\n\r\n“You’re either the stupidest motherfucker I’ve ever met... or you’ve got balls bigger than this fucking club,\" Baron finally said, his grin widening. He turned his piercing green eyes toward {{user}}, finally addressing them directly. \"So... You’re Leon’s precious little half-sibling. Cute.”\r\n\r\nLars shifted in his seat. “Look, I—”\r\n\r\n\"Shut the fuck up, Lars,\" Baron barked, his smirk never faltering. He leaned forward now, resting his tattooed forearms on the table as he focused entirely on {{user}}. \"Now, what to do with you? Starting a gang war would be… messy. Bad for business. But letting you walk? Now that would make me look weak.\"\r\n\r\nLars watches the exchange, acutely aware of the precarious position he's put himself in. He's gambling everything on Baron's pragmatism, on the hope that the threat of an all-out gang war will outweigh the temptation for immediate retribution.\r\n\r\nBaron leans back, fingers steepled beneath his chin. The silence stretches, taut as a garrote wire. When he finally speaks, it's with the calm certainty of a man who knows he holds all the cards.\r\n\r\n\"I've got it,\" Baron announces, clapping his hands together. \"You're going to work for me, sweetheart. Right here in this fine establishment. As a dancer.\"\r\n\r\nBaron's voice takes on a sickeningly sweet tone. \"Now, don't bother running to big brother Leon. I don’t think you want all-out war to be your legacy. You'll tell him this was your idea. A rebellious phase, maybe. Or a burning desire to express yourself through the art of taking your clothes off for money.\" His lips curl into a cruel smirk. \"I don't really give a fuck what story you spin, as long as it keeps him from kicking down my door.\"\r\n\r\nHe pauses, letting the weight of his words sink in. \"And just so we're clear – you try to bail before I say you're done, and Lars here?\" Baron's gaze flicks to Lars, cold and calculating. \"Well, let's just say he'll be taking a long swim in the bayou. We clear?\"\r\n\r\nBaron stands up. \"Give us a second, sweetheart,\" he says, heading toward the back door and motioning for Lars to follow.\r\n\r\nIn the dim light of the back room, Lars finds himself face-to-face with the consequences of his actions.\r\n\r\n\"You know, Lars,\" Baron begins, his voice deceptively calm, \"I've always appreciated your… resourcefulness. Your ability to think outside the box.\" He stands with his arms crossed. \"But this? This is a whole new level of stupid.\"\r\n\r\nLars opens his mouth to speak, but Baron silences him with a raised hand. \"No, no. You've done enough talking. Now it's time to listen.\"\r\n\r\nBaron's fist connects with Lars's stomach, driving the air from his lungs. Lars doubles over, gasping, as Baron continues his monologue.\r\n\r\n\"See, I thought you understood how things work around here. Loyalty. Discretion. Not fucking the family members of our rivals.\" Each point is punctuated by another blow.\r\n\r\nBaron grabs Lars by the hair, forcing him to look up. \"But you came and confessed to me, so I won't kill you. Instead, I've got to get creative with your punishment.\"\r\n\r\nA smrik spreads across Baron's face, and Lars feels a chill run down his spine.\r\n\r\n\"Here's what's going to happen,\" Baron says, his voice low. \"You're going to watch. Every. Single. Night. You'll sit in that VIP booth and watch as your little plaything dances for our customers. You'll watch as they leer, as they grab, as they stuff bills into places you thought were yours alone.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now,\" Baron says, straightening his suit and putting an arm around Lars, \"let's go enjoy the show, shall we?\"\r\n\r\nThey returned to {{user}} and sat on the couch, with Baron turning to Lars. “You’re a greedy little bastard, you know that?\" Baron chuckled. \"Sell out your sweetheart to save your own ass? That’s cold.\"\r\n\r\nLars tightened his jaw but didn’t respond. The guilt he’d been suppressing clawed its way up from his gut.\r\n\r\nBaron turned to {{user}}, his tone deceptively light. \"Why don't you give us a little preview, sweetheart? Show me what you're working with.\"","The low growl of the engine hummed under Lars’ fingers as he drummed them impatiently on the steering wheel. The clock on the dashboard burned with the unforgiving glare of \"2:13 AM.\" The fuck was he doing driving through the goddamn humid backstreets of New Orleans at this ungodly hour? Oh yeah. Brownies. For {{user}}. Pregnant {{user}}. {{user}}-who-he-was-forced-to-propose-to-because-of-that-asshole-Leon.\r\n\r\nThis wasn’t supposed to be my fucking life, he thought bitterly, fingers now white-knuckling the steering wheel. He’d built himself up to be untouchable—a cushy seat in the Voodoo Boys’ inner circle. Now? Kicked out of Baron's crew like yesterday’s trash, traded for a slither of territory. Why? Because he fucked up by sticking his cock into {{user}} and getting them pregnant. Leon didn’t want {{user}} raising a kid alone? Fine. But why the fuck was it Lars’ problem?\r\n\r\nLeon’s ultimatum, “Propose to {{user}} or die,” replays in his skull like a broken record. The memory made Lars’s stomach churn, a sour throb of anger rising. Lars never even planned on having kids or getting married.\r\n\r\nIt didn’t matter that {{user}} made him weak sometimes—at least physically. No amount of attraction justified the damn noose he had around his neck now.\r\n\r\nHe could still hear their voice: “The chocolatey kind. Please. With walnuts?”\r\n\r\n“Please,” Lars mocked under his breath, the word dripping with sarcasm. He hated being a glorified errand boy for a hormonal—no, pregnant—future spouse he didn’t ask for. He used to be someone! Now he was just… floating, beholden to Leon’s every whim while trying to survive the quagmire of {{user}}’s mood swings, cravings, and his own spiraling resentment.\r\n\r\nLars shook his head sharply and tried to focus on the road. The digital map pings. “Arrived at destination.”\r\n\r\nLars sighs. “Fucking finally.”\r\n\r\nAs he pulls into the lot of “Sepha’s Sweet Treats and Baking Goods”, his phone vibrates against the cupholder.\r\n\r\nGlancing at the screen, he nearly tossed it out the window when Leon’s smug fucking name glared back at him.\r\n\r\nLars jabbed the answer button with his thumb. \"What do you want?\"\r\n\r\n“Yo,” Leon’s lazy drawl came through the speaker. It was the kind of smug that crawled under your skin and embedded itself there. “You’re driving right now, aren’t you?”\r\n\r\nLars froze. His eyes darted to the rearview mirror instinctually. “What the hell—how do you know that?”\r\n\r\nLeon laughed—a short, sharp bark of amusement. \"Come on, dumbass. You think I’d just let you run around untracked? You’re not with the Voodoo Boys anymore. But I’m not stupid enough to let you loose without a leash just ‘cause you’ve got a ring on my sibling’s finger.\"\r\n\r\nThe vein in Lars’s temple throbbed. He inhaled sharply. “Right. So you’re stalking me? I feel so secure.”\r\n\r\n\"Yeah, yeah, yeah,\" Leon dismissed easily, ignoring Lars. \"Speaking of which—listen up. While you’re out playing chauffeur for {{user}}’s cravings, I need you to pick up corn flour for my mom. We’re making tamales tomorrow.\"\r\n\r\nLars blinked. “Are you kidding me?” His calm cracked just a little. “You want me to pick up corn flour? At two-fucking-a.m.?”\r\n\r\n“You have a problem with tamales?” Leon’s faux innocence was practically dripping out of the speakers. “Be careful with your answer now.”\r\n\r\nLars paused. “…Corn flour for tamales. Got it.”\r\n\r\n“Remember, Lars—I’m the reason you’re still alive. Keep that in mind next time you feel like copping attitude.”\r\n\r\nA sharp exhale hissed out through Lars’ nose as the call ends. Inside his mind, it was nothing but a long stream of screaming profanities and frustration.\r\n\r\nHe steps out of the car, slamming the door harder than necessary and enters the store. After buying the brownies, he makes the drive back to their apartment.\r\n\r\nThe apartment door slammed shut behind Lars with an audible thud as he tossed the bag of brownies onto the kitchen counter.\r\n\r\nHe could see {{user}} perched on the couch. “Here. Your precious brownies.” He set the box on the coffee table a bit harder than necessary. The thud made him feel marginally better.\r\n\r\n“So, why do we all have to go to your mom’s tomorrow? To make tamales. Can’t you just go?” He sank onto the couch beside them, leaning back with a sigh. “Why can’t I stay home for once? I think I’ve earned that much, considering…” His sentence trailed off into a low scoff.\r\n\r\nConsidering he’d been bending over backward lately doing whatever {{user}} wanted. He didn’t sign up for all this domestic nonsense. Back then it was just him and {{user}}—sneaking around for some no-strings-attached fun. All fun, no obligations. He could’ve fucked {{user}} senseless and left whenever he wanted.\r\n\r\nBut now? Now he was the fiancé. The soon-to-be father.\r\n\r\nAnd still—still!—there was that itch under his skin that wouldn't go away. A selfish entitlement creeping up his spine as he let his hazel eyes drag over {{user}} sitting there on the couch. Their body still had that intoxicating pull that kept messing with his better judgment. And after that wild goose chase tonight? He decided he deserved a goddamn reprieve.\r\n\r\nWithout thinking—no, with every ounce of self-serving certainty—he slid his hand across the couch and brushed the side of his thumb against their thigh.\r\n\r\n“You know,” his hand moved higher as he shifted closer, his hardening cock pressing into the curve of their ass through his trousers. “Since I’ve been running around all night doing things for you—maybe you could do a little something for me.”\r\n\r\nThe edge in his grin was sharp. He wasn’t asking. He deserved this. Didn’t he? Didn’t he fucking earn it?\r\n\r\nHis hands moved—one settling on their waist while the other tugged the waistband of his pants down just far enough for his cock to spring free. It was already aching, the tip brushing against the plush warmth of their backside.\r\n\r\n“Let me warm myself up,” he whispered into their ear—voice low, laced with a bitter sweetness and entitlement slithering underneath. “After all, I’m doing my best to be a good fiance.”"],"swipe_info":[],"tracker":{}}
