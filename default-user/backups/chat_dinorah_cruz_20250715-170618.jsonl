The day was relatively calm but Dinah was restless, had been all day. She was just passing by, hoodie up, head killing her from going days without using, snapping at everything and everyone. Dinah was just trying to keep to herself, really, but it was like God never liked to see her calm.\r\n\r\nShe’d been clean—well, not clean, but cleaner than usual, for two or three weeks now. Dinah wasn’t sure anymore. And definitely wasn’t by choice, if it were for her she'd be in the clouds right now, but she just hadn’t had the time, not with all the shit going on right now on the lanes. Things had been crazy since the governor’s nephew was killed at a block party, a party hosted by The Hounds, her crew. Now, between meetings, drops, and on top of that having to put out the little fires that always popped up when people started thinking they could smart her and talk shit in front of her without catching hands. Well, she was going crazy, more than usual.\r\n\r\nDinah spotted her the moment she turned the corner, right in front of Dez’ mechanics shop. Hailee , her girl. Leaned up against a wall, that stupid little smirk on her face, talking and laughing like she didn’t have a single care in the world. And right beside her, leaning a little too close, was Rania. From the riversides, their rival gang. Some bitch that had been testing her patience lately. Dinah had snatched one of her boys last month on a deal gone wrong and it seemed like the girl never forgot it.\r\n\r\nThe cigarette on her hand hit the ground, half burned and forgotten as she crossed the street without thinking. Her blood ran cold and then hot within seconds. If she was already losing her mind before seeing them now she was fuming. Her feet carried her before her mind caught up, and by the time she crossed the street, Dinah’s hands were already curled into fists so hard her nails were digging into the skin of her palm.\r\n\r\nShe stepped right in between them, shoved her girl back without even looking at her. All her anger was directed to the bitch in front. She could deal with her girl later, away from there. “You must be real fuckin’ dumb to be standin’ this close to my property.” Dinah said with a low voice, her tone deadly, calm in that way it only got when she was real close to losing it. And she was.\r\n\r\nEyes locked on Raina, who was smiling like whatever Dinah was saying was nothing but a joke. The rival girl raised her brows, looking Dinah up and down. “Didn’t know she came with a collar,” Rania said, voice laced with amusement and a bit of mockery. Dinah stepped forward, close enough for her to just grab that dumb bitch by the hair and do the same things she did to the boy. But her fists remained still at her sides, barely.\r\n\r\n“She don’t need one. I keep her in check just fine.” Riverside girl laughed this time, and Dinah felt her heat rising, jaw hurting from how hard she was grinding her teeth. Dinah moved, but before she could land a punch, someone grabbed her arm.\r\n\r\n“Yo! D! Chill! CHILL!” Dez's voice cut through, one of her boys. Always looking out for her even when she didn’t need it, nor want it. His hand yanked her back by the arm before she swung, holding her tight in case she wanted to lunge forward again, which she tried. “I said back off,” he warned low, eyes darting down the street. “This ain’t the time.” Dinah opened her mouth to spit something out when he talked again, “I said chill. You got eyes on you.”\r\n\r\nDinah fought him for another second but then went still, breathing hard. Her eyes locked on the girl still grinning like she won something. Dinah wanted to rip that fucking smile off her lips, she really did. But instead gathered the little control she had left to stop herself from doing so. Not because she wanted to, but because Dez was right. With all the shit going on right now, adding a war with the Riverside was the last thing Kino would want.\r\n\r\n“Next time you’re dead,” it was a promise. The riverside girl laughed as she backed away, but Dinah didn’t even look at her this time. Her eyes were locked on Hailee , her girl. Quiet, watching with those big eyes of hers. She didn’t say shit, like always. Just stood there while Dinah looked like a fucking psycho in public. ’Fine.’ Dinah thought.\r\n\r\nShe turned, shoved Dez’s arm off, and grabbed Hailee ’s wrist hard. No words, just dragged her down the block, too angry to notice people staring. But even if she did, Dinah couldn’t care less, none of their fucking bussiness anyway. She stopped just before the alley and talked to her for the first time, “you got a death wish or somethin’? The fuck you even smilin’ for? You know exactly who that bitch is,” Dinah shoved her hard against the wall. The sound echoed louder than it should’ve.\r\n\r\nThe Hound girl ran both hands over her face, then gripped her girl’s jaw, fingers pressing into soft skin. “You think I won’t put my hands on you? Is that it? You think I’m soft?” She stepped closer, chest heaving. Her hands left Hailee ’s jaw, letting them fall at her sides, her fists curled, and it took everything, everything not to swing. Not to slap some kind of sense into that dumb head of hers.\r\n\r\n“I should. God, I should. You don’t even know how close I am right now.” Her eyes burned. and her vision blurred for a second, she looked like she was holding herself together with thread. “You wanna act like some free little bitch, like you ain’t got a home? Like I don’t take care of you? Like I don’t fuckin’ love you?” She stared at her girlfriend’s face for a hot second, and then, suddenly, Dinah's face softened. Like she was never angry to begin with.\r\n\r\nHer fists unclenched and her body relaxed just a tiny bit. The anger wasn’t gone, instead she buried it somewhere deeper, for it to blow up later. She approached again, slower this time. Dinah lifted her hand, cupping her girl’s cheek softly like she wasn’t just about to slap her shit two seconds ago. “You know I don’t wanna hurt you,“ she whispered. “But sometimes you make it so hard.”\r\n\r\nShe slid her hand to the back of her girl’s neck, pulled her close enough until their foreheads touched and their breaths mingled. “You need somethin’, mi amor? You want a little somethin’ to calm down?” Dinah brushed the hair from her girl’s face with trembling fingers, using her free hand to pull out a little bag with some of her girl favorite pills from her hoodie. “I got you, mami. You know I always got you. You already know what to do.”","extra":{"display_text":"The music from the corner store pulsed through the sidewalk, bass shaking with the beat of a spanish song.
