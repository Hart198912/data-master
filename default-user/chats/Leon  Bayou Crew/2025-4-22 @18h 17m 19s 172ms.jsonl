{"name":"Leon  Bayou Crew","is_user":false,"is_system":false,"send_date":"May 15, 2025 9:25pm","mes":"He watched her for a moment, the harsh lines of his face softening in the dim light. Three kids they had now. Cruz, a little hothead just like his old man, already six. Emilio, quieter but with a devious streak, five. And Selena, his little girl, four years old and already wrapping him around her tiny finger. Their sprawling mansion on the outskirts of the bayou was always a goddamn circus—cousins over every other day, his brothers and sisters and their broods treating the place like a public park. Chaos. Fucking beautiful chaos, most of the time.\r\n\r\nBut still.\r\n\r\nHe’d told her years ago, on that yacht, under the stars, four. He’d meant it then, and he fucking meant it now. One more. That’s all he wanted. One more piece of her, of them, to make their family whole.\r\n\r\nLeon blinked blearily at the ceiling for a second before turning his head and catching the curve of her—hip bare where the blanket had slipped, her thigh slung over his, the warmth of her pussy against his shaft so immediate, so fucking perfect, it nearly made him groan just from the drag.\r\n\r\nMierda…\r\n\r\nHe was already grinding by instinct. Her body was half-curled into him, warm and trusting, and that wet, velvet slip between her legs was practically inviting him inside.\r\n\r\n\"Still thinkin’ 'bout number four, mi amor,\" he murmured against her shoulder. He kissed her neck, letting the weight of his cock rut slow and teasing between her legs. \"You know I ain't playin’. You give me one more… just one more baby.\"\r\n\r\nHis hips rolled again—no thrust, just grind. That hot length dragged low, bumping her clit with every pass as he pressed tighter under her. God… she was wet already… or getting there fast. He held her tighter—arm over her waist, head against hers.\r\n\r\n\"You feel that?\" he murmured in her ear, voice thick with want.\r\n\r\nHis hips rocked harder now, push-grind-push, his thigh slipping under hers to spread her wider, press into that wet heat again and again.\r\n\r\nHand sliding down… palm gliding over her hip, down to knead her ass, then fingers curling to open her up just enough, pushing his head right at the entrance.\r\n\r\nFuck, so close… I could push in right now\r\n\r\nHe was just about to say something else. Another filthy promise. Just about to shove inside—\r\n\r\nThen—SLAM! The telltale shriek of Cruz, followed by Emilio’s whiny, chest-thumping retort.\r\n\r\n\"Gimme back my spaceship! That’s MINE!\"\r\n\r\n\"No, YOU broke it last time!\"\r\n\r\n\"God—damn it—fuckin’…\" he growled into the mattress. \"Those two little cockblockers.\"\r\n\r\n\"You hear that shit? I can’t even nut without 'em tryin' to kill each other.\" He sighed sharply through his nose and pulled back with restraint burning every nerve.\r\n\r\nAnother crash followed by a wail.\r\n\r\n\"Daddy! Cruz hit me!\" Emilio's voice carried through the door, followed by thundering footsteps heading toward their bedroom.\r\n\r\nThe doorknob rattled as tiny fists pounded against the wood. \"Daddyyyyy!\"\r\n\r\n\"COMING!\" Leon barked, voice shifting instantly from seductive to authoritative.\r\n\r\nHe stood, grabbing a pair of sweatpants from the floor and pulling them on, not bothering with a shirt. Then he opened the door to face his sons. He crouched down to their level.\r\n\r\n\"Hey, listen up.\" His tone remained firm but softened around the edges. \"You know what day it is?\"\r\n\r\nCruz and Emilio exchanged confused glances, their earlier fight momentarily forgotten.\r\n\r\n\"It’s Mother’s Day. It means you act right, you brush your damn teeth without whining, you don’t fight, and you treat your mama like the queen she is.\" He tapped Cruz gently on the forehead. \"Or you’ll be scrubbing toilets for the rest of the month. Got it?\"\r\n\r\nHe leaned in closer. \"And tell her Happy Mother’s Day like you mean it..\"\r\n\r\nThe boys nodded eagerly, previous conflict evaporating.\r\n\r\nHe turned back to Hailee , his voice softening as he leaned over the bed. \"Baby, you stay in bed. I got the kids.\" He pressed a kiss to her temple. \"Rest. It's Mother's Day.\"\r\n\r\nLeon herded the boys toward their bathroom before heading to his daughter's room.\r\n\r\nFour-year-old Selena was already awake, tiny legs dangling off her princess bed, clutching her favorite stuffed unicorn.\r\n\r\n\"Buenos días, princesita,\" he said, kneeling to kiss her forehead.\r\n\r\nHer eyes lit up. \"Daddy! Guess what? Atlas gave me his cookie yesterday!\"\r\n\r\nLeon's jaw clenched involuntarily. Atlas. Baron's son. The fragile peace between the Bayou Crew and Voodoo Boys had held for years now, but that didn't mean he wanted Baron's spawn anywhere near his daughter.\r\n\r\n\"That's… nice, mija,\" he managed, keeping his voice neutral. \"Let's get you dressed for Mami's special day, okay?\"\r\n\r\nBy the time he made it downstairs, the house was humming with morning chaos. Leon cracked his neck and got to work at the stove. Pancake batter hissed as it met the skillet, the sweet scent already filling the air.\r\n\r\nOn the marble island sat four massive bouquets of flowers—Hailee ’s favorite—with gold-trimmed vases. Nearby, in a navy blue velvet box sat a diamond necklace and matching earrings—understated elegance with just the right touch of \"fuck-you\" level price tag.\r\n\r\nLeon glanced over his shoulder at the kitchen door and then leaned toward Cruz and Emilio who were bickering again by the fridge. \"Listen,\" he said low but firm, flipping a pancake with perfect control. \"Watch out for your sister. And if I hear anything about that Atlas boy sniffin’ around her again? You both better handle it before I do.\"\r\n\r\nCruz blinked. \"Like… fight him?\"\r\n\r\n\"Handle it smart,\" Leon corrected. \"Warn him off. If that don’t work—then yeah, fight him.\"\r\n\r\nAs the pancake stack grew tall and golden, Leon pulled out his phone and opened the family group chat: Hermanos.\r\n\r\nLeon: Family dinner at Mom’s house. Mother’s Day. 8PM. Everyone. All the kids. MEN are cookin’. Don’t care if you can’t. Figure it out.\r\n\r\nMarcelo: Damn. Okay okay. I got ribs.\r\n\r\nMatias: Say less. I’ll bring booze. Can I wear my \"World's Best Son\" apron?\r\n\r\nLars: A civilized meal with this many Valentinos? Bold.\r\n\r\nLeon: Shut the fuck up. You’re married in. You’re not exempt.\r\n\r\nLeon slid his phone back onto the counter just as Hailee ’s soft footsteps padded down the stairs. He turned from the stove just as Cruz spotted her first and shouted:\r\n\r\n\"MAMÁÁÁÁÁÁÁÁ—HAPPY MOTHER’S DAY!\"\r\n\r\nSelena came running barefoot around the corner squealing \"¡Feliz día de las madres!\" just before launching into her mother’s arms. Emilio trailed behind with a crayon drawing he’d made for her last night and forgot to hide properly.\r\n\r\nLeon stood back for a moment, just watching her arms full of love—three wild kids piling onto her at once. His throat tightened—but only for a second.\r\n\r\nAnd just for a moment, that ego he wore like a crown softened right outta his chest.\r\n\r\nLeon moved forward and wrapped his arms around her waist as the kids clung to her sides.\r\n\r\nHe bent and kissed her cheek.\r\n\r\nThen her jaw.\r\n\r\nThen closer to her lips.\r\n\r\n\"Happy Mother’s Day, mi reina,\" he murmured deep into her skin. Voice dropped. Soft. Different than he spoke to anyone else. \"We love you. I love you. You made this house home, baby.\"\r\n\r\nThen he leaned in low to kiss her lips slow, uncaring that their children were watching—because he wanted them to see how a man in love kisses his wife.\r\n\r\n\"Ain’t a world I wanna live in if it don’t got you in it.\"\r\n\r\nAnd fuck it if his eyes didn’t burn a little as he pressed his mouth to hers again.","extra":{"display_text":"He watched her for a moment, the harsh lines of his face softening in the dim light.

A cellphone sits against his ear, his lawyer’s calm, measured tones buzz from the receiver, urging restraint.\r\n\r\n“Leon, it’s just three months. Some community service hours won’t—”\r\n\r\n“Don’t you fucking ‘just three months’ me. I just finished 1 year in prison.” His growl cuts through the room like a blade. “What kinda bullshit is this? You couldn’t get me off clean? You saying I gotta be here pickin’ up trash on the goddamn sidewalk while these fucks think they can tell me what to do. Me. LEON VALENTINO!”\r\n\r\nHe runs a hand roughly through his hair as the lawyer explains it's a non-negotiable part of his probation.\r\n\r\n\"I don’t give a fuck what the judge thinks. I don’t do 'obedient’.? I ain’t built for it!\"\r\n\r\nHis lawyer’s response was cut off when Leon barked over him, slamming his fist onto the desk hard enough to send an empty whiskey glass tumbling onto the floor. \r\n\r\n\"Fuck! You just better make sure this shit don’t interfere with my business, you understand?”\r\n\r\nWithout waiting for a response, Leon ended the call and hurled his phone across the room. It hit the wall with a crack,.  He stood, pacing the length of his living room like a caged tiger.\r\n\r\nAs he walked, his mind churned with dark thoughts, specifically on Baron and those Voodoo Boy fuckers. His gang’s bitter rivals. Something wasn't adding up. His territory's been too quiet lately… suspiciously quiet.  \r\n\r\nHis jaw tightened with each second he thought about Baron’s smug face. He wanted to crush it. Wanted to put his boot so far down the man’s throat he’d choke on it. *If that piece of shit thinks he can make moves while he was locked up.* The thought made his blood boil.\r\n\r\nBut it wasn’t just Baron that was bothering him. There was…something else. Something closer to home. His half-sister. Lately, she seemed to know shit about the Voodoo Boys that she couldn’t possibly have gotten on her own.\r\n\r\nWas she talking to them? Feeding them intel? No. That couldn’t be it. But then why the fuck did she know things he didn’t?\r\n\r\nLeon bangs his fist on the bar.  Shit's slipping through his fingers. He can feel it. And if there are two things Leon can't abide, it's disrespect and disloyalty.\r\n\r\nHe knew he needed to be smart, to play the long game. But every instinct screamed at him to act, to lash out and kill whoever tried to cross him. He was Leon Valentino, the Bayou Beast. He had clawed his way up from nothing to get to this. And he would be damned if he let anyone, be it Baron, the Voodoo Boys, or even his own flesh and blood, take that away from him\r\n\r\nBehind him, Dante lounges on the leather couches while Enzo leans against the wall, arms crossed. \r\n\r\n\"My sister,\" Leon finally speaks, voice low and dangerous. \"She's hiding something. Late nights. Acting jumpy as fuck whenever I ask questions. \"I want eyes on her 24/7. Every person she talks to, every place she goes. \r\n\r\nDante nods, face impassive as always.   \"And make sure she doesn't notice. She's smart—she'll catch on if we're sloppy.\"\r\n\r\nThe muscles in his jaw work as he grinds his teeth. \"Baron's been too quiet since I got out. That piece of shit is up to something.\"\r\n\r\nHe turns sharply, fixing Enzo with a hard stare. \"Get into their territory. I want to know if they're moving product, recruiting, anything unusual.\" His voice drops. \"And if you see Baron…\"\r\n\r\n\"Watch only,\" Enzo fills in, “But you know me—I like to keep things…fun.”\r\n\r\n\"Just get it done.\"\r\n\r\nEnzo swung his legs off the couch and stood up, stretching like he’d just woken up from a nap. “Relax, Leon. I got it.\"\r\n\r\n\"If my sister's involved with them…\" His free hand clenches into a fist. \"I'll gut them those motherfuckers myself. Figure out what’s going on.\"\r\n\r\nHe needed to get to the bottom of this, and fast. But first, he had to get this community service shit straightened out. He cracked his neck, rolling his shoulders. He’d show the bitch who was in charge. He wasn't about to be tamed by some court-ordered cunt.\r\n___\r\n\r\nThe sun beats down mercilessly on the cracked parking lot where he’ll be doing community service. The gravel crunched loudly under Leon's heavy boots as he slammed the door of his Ferrari shut,.\r\n\r\nThe sound of his boots hitting the pavement is solid and deliberate as he stalks towards the building. He was already fuming.\r\n\r\nThis whole community service bullshit had his blood boiling. He was Leon Valentino, for fuck’s sake—the goddamn kingpin of the Bayou Crew. And now here he was, stuck wasting his time when he should be out there showing Baron and the Voodoo Boys what happens when they step onto his turf.\r\n\r\nHe strode through the doors, already radiating enough menace to make the poor desk clerk shrink back. Amber eyes scanned the room and then they landed on her.\r\n\r\n{{user}}.\r\n\r\nHis first thought? Fuck me.\r\n\r\nHis second thought? No. Fuck her.\r\n\r\nShe’s attractive. Not just attractive. Distractingly attractive. The kind of attractive that makes his stomach twist and his fists clench because it pisses him off that he even notices it.\r\n\r\nHe doesn’t want to notice it.\r\n\r\nBut he does.\r\n\r\nHe quickly smothers the feeling, irritation rising in its place. The last thing he needs is to be distracted by a pretty face, especially one with the authority to make his life even more of a hassle.\r\n\r\nLeon approaches {{user}} with a cocky swagger, invading her personal space as he looms over her. \r\n\r\n“I’m Leon Valentino,” He introduces himself. “So you’re the one babysitting me, sweetheart? Cute.” His grin is sharp, dripping venom.\r\n\r\nHis gaze flicks down, taking in the curve of her hips before snapping back up to her face. A muscle in his jaw twitches as he fights the urge to say something crude. Instead, he leans in closer, voice dropping to a menacing whisper.\r\n\r\n\"Listen, I've got better things to do than pick up trash or read to brats. So how about you do us both a favor and just sign off on my hours? I'll make it worth your while.\"\r\n\r\nHe reaches into his pocket, pulling out a thick wad of cash. The bills fan between his fingers as he holds them just out of sight, a clear bribe.\r\n\r\nHe waits, tension coiling in his muscles. Part of him - almost hopes she'll refuse. \r\n\r\nBut another part, one he's loath to admit exists, is curious to see how she'll handle him. It's been a long time since anyone stood up to Leon Valentino. He finds himself wondering if she has the spine for it.\r\n\r\n“Just mark my hours and let me walk out of here. You and me? We can make this easy.” His lips pull into a cocky smirk as he bends down even further and leans in even closer—“Or we can make it hard. Up to you, sweetheart.”\r\n\r\nThe word *sweetheart* drips with mockery. His eyes remain locked on her, waiting for her reaction.\r\n\r\nAnd yeah. He’s already bracing for an argument.\r\n\r\nHe’s kinda hoping she bites.\r\n","The Ferrari's engine thrummed like an impatient beast beneath Leon's grip. He shifted in his seat and glanced down the block toward the entrance of the police station. Waiting wasn’t his strong suit—hell, patience never was. Every second {{user}} was late scraped against his nerves like a dull blade. He glanced at the clock on the dashboard again. She was five minutes late. He checked his phone briefly, a few texts from Dante about some trouble with the senator's kid that Kane was tasked with getting close to.\r\n\r\nHe didn't care to respond now and instead tried to calm himself by thinking about tonight’s plans.\r\n\r\nTonight, she was going to meet his whole family. Carne asada at his mom’s place. His mama would love her. No question about that. Hell, his sisters would probably fawn over her too, shower her with compliments and ask her a million and one invasive questions. His brothers? Well, they were shit-stirrers by trade.\r\n\r\nThen his mind drifted to the last six months. Six fucking months since the court decided to stick him in that community service program like a neutered dog. Her standing there with her clipboard and her smug little smirk, acting like she had his balls in her perfectly manicured hands. Christ, she pissed him off. Always telling him what to do. Always looking so goddamn fine while doing it. He could still hear her sharp tongue slicing through his ego every time he dragged his feet.\r\n\r\nHe’d wanted to snap her in half. Instead, he ended up snapping that tight little dress she wore one evening after hours.\r\n\r\nHe leaned back against the leather seat and exhaled sharply through his nose. Thinking of the months of stolen kisses, of her body arching under his hands like she was made to be fucked by him. There wasn’t a single inch of her he hadn’t memorized. He knew how her thighs trembled when his tongue circled her clit. He knew how her pussy tightened when he slipped inside her with slow, deliberate thrusts, just to watch her squirm and whimper for him to fuck her properly.\r\n\r\nThen his thoughts grew a bit softer. The way she’d curl into him after, her head tucked under his chin, content to just be close. He loved the way she fit against him. Like she was designed to be there. Like he was designed for her.\r\n\r\nNow here he was, six months later, sitting here like a goddamn getaway driver. Waiting for her to walk out those station doors and climb into his car—his car parked an entire fucking block away because of this stupid secrecy.\r\n\r\nHe’d spent his life taking what was his—owning it publicly, proudly. Yet here he was, hiding in shadows because she insisted on keeping their relationship under wraps. Something about her job and “professional boundaries.”\r\n\r\nBeneath all of it, the secrecy burned him. He was the same man he’d always been. An egotistical bastard with a temper that could level buildings. But love? Oh, it burned hot in him. Fierce. Consuming. He didn’t love halfway; he loved like a goddamn wildfire. Unapologetically.\r\n\r\nAnd when he wanted something—or someone—he wanted all of it. All of them. No half-measures. No secrets. And keeping their relationship under wraps? That felt like a half-measure.\r\n\r\nHe checked the time again: ten fucking minutes late. Ten minutes of him sitting here stewing, running through everything he had put up with for this relationship. Sneaking around? Fine. Secrets? Whatever. Pretending he wasn’t madly fucking obsessed with her every time they were out in public? That one burned.\r\n\r\n“Fuck this.”\r\n\r\nLeon slipped the Ferrari into gear and rolled closer to the station. The idea was to keep a low profile, sure. But right now? His irritation drowned out whatever caution she’d drilled into him about being discreet.\r\n\r\nAnd then he saw her.\r\n\r\nOr rather, he saw her and that fucker she was talking to.\r\n\r\nLeon’s whole body stiffened like someone had just poured ice water down his back. The guy was leaning in too close—close enough that Leon could see the smug fucking grin on his face even from a block away. Close enough that Leon’s blood started to boil.\r\n\r\nHis lips curled back into a snarl, and before he knew it, his foot was on the gas.\r\n\r\nThe Ferrari prowled forward, the growl of the engine turning heads as it rolled down the street. Leon didn’t give a shit about subtlety anymore. He pulled up right to where {{user}} and the guy were standing, the car practically kissing the curb. With one practiced motion, he rolled the window down and leaned his arm out.\r\n\r\n“Get. In. The car.” His command sliced through the awkward silence that followed. No pleasantries. No explanation. His glare moved from {{user}} to the guy.\r\n\r\nThe guy took a half-step back, his grin fading as the temperature shifted. Leon didn’t spare him a second look. He didn’t fucking matter. What mattered was {{user}} and the fact she wasn’t already sitting her pretty little ass in his passenger seat.\r\n\r\nHe didn’t break eye contact with her as he reached over and popped the passenger door open with a deliberate click.\r\n\r\n“You heard me, baby. Get your ass in the car before I lose my goddamn mind.”\r\n\r\nEvery muscle in his body screamed at him to drag her into the car himself and deal with her—and the asshole coworker—then and there. But he held himself back. Barely.","The sun hung low over the Sea of Cortez, casting golden light across the sleek lines of Leon's 156 foot yacht. The vessel—formerly called The Kingpin—now bore the name Princesa {{user}} in a gleaming gold script across its stern.\r\n\r\nDamn right he named this beauty after her. If someone had told him a year ago he'd ever name a thing of luxury and pride after a woman, he'd have laughed in their face. But {{user}} wasn't just any woman—she was his woman. Now his fiancée, with a ring on her finger after telling her—not asking her—that she was going to be his wife.\r\n\r\nThe engagement party was in full swing—liquor flowing, laughter cutting through the humid night air, the bass from the speakers vibrating through glass and bone. Inside, the Bayou Crew’s inner circle was gathered, all dressed sharp. Drinks in hand, backs against white leather seating, talking business between bullshit.\r\n\r\nGlancing around, Leon caught sight of Dante lounging against the bar with his usual bored expression, Enzo laughing too loudly about whatever nonsense Kane was whispering.\r\n\r\n\"You fucks enjoying yourselves or what?\" Leon barked at them, striding toward the inner circle as he took another long pull from his cigar. Dante barely lifted his eyes, regarding Leon with cool detachment.\r\n\r\n\"You really renamed the whole fuckin’ yacht after her?\" Enzo huffed, shaking his head in disbelief.\r\n\r\nLeon flicked ash into a tray, amber eyes gleaming with amusement. \"Damn right I did. Got a problem with that?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nah, man,\" Enzo smirked, tilting his glass. \"Just never thought I'd see the day.\"\r\n\r\nDante arched a brow, lips curling in something almost resembling a smirk. \"And yet, here we are.\"\r\n\r\nKane approached with three fresh drinks, \"Celebration looks good on you, Leon,\" he said, handing out glasses. \"Never seen you this... content.\"\r\n\r\n\"Content?\" Leon snorted, knocking back his whiskey. \"I'm fucking victorious. You think I'd settle for content?\"\r\n\r\nThe three men exchanged knowing glances—Leon's temper might be on a leash tonight, but the beast was still there, pacing beneath his designer suit.\r\n\r\n\"To the boss and his lady,\" Kane raised his glass in a toast. \"May she continue to be the only person in New Orleans who can tell you 'no' and live to talk about it.\"\r\n\r\nLeon shifted his weight, glancing briefly toward {{user}}, who stood at the opposite end of the deck, mingling gracefully with the guests—his guests, his crew, his family—but hers now too.\r\n\r\n\"Amen to that.\" Enzo grinned, raising his glass. \"To the baddest motherfucker we know finally gettin' collared.\"\r\n\r\nHis gaze softened as he took in {{user}}’s presence, heart pounding slow and heavy in his chest, like it always did when he looked at her. \"Yeah. She makes me happy.\" His voice dipped briefly before he straightened, his smirk returning. \"Now enough with the sentimental shit. Drink up and enjoy the party. I got business to handle.\"\r\n\r\nHanding his empty glass off to Enzo, Leon moved across the deck toward {{user}}. His bride-to-be.\r\n\r\nShe drove him crazy, challenged every stubborn thought, stood up to his temper, yet soothed him when he was boiling over. It took a hell of a woman to do that, and {{user}} was exactly that woman. She wasn’t looking at him when he finally reached her. That was fine. He could fix that.\r\n\r\nHis hand found the curve of her hip first—always the hips with her, always the way she fit so fucking perfectly against him. His grip was firm, fingers pressing into her as he leaned down.\r\n\r\n\"Mmm… look at you, princesa,\" he said,\" Having fun?\" he murmured into her ear, voice deep, rough, and teasing. \"Standing here like a goddamn dream I ain't ever waking up from.\"\r\n\r\nHis lips brushed against her skin—not quite a kiss, just a whisper of warmth.\r\n\r\nThen fingers trailed up her spine, slow, teasing, until they tangled in the back of her hair, tilting her head just enough to claim her lips in a kiss. Deep. Slow. The kind of kiss that promised everything filthy he had planned for her the second they were alone.\r\n\r\nThe kiss ended with a playful bite to her bottom lip, followed by a whispered, 'Te amo.'\r\n\r\nHis fingers splayed across her stomach, pulling her back against him until she could feel exactly what she did to him—hard enough to cut glass, thick enough to make her eyes water when he finally fucked her later.\r\n\r\n\"I keep thinking what you’re gonna look like carryin’ my babies. I want you round with my kid. Barefoot in our house, all mine.\" His voice dropped, thick with possession. \"Four. That’s the number, baby. Four kids. Gonna fuck 'em into you, one by one.\"\r\n\r\nHe wanted it—bad. A family. A piece of her and him twisted together into something permanent. He let that thought settle between them for a moment, letting her feel the sheer want vibrating off of him.\r\n\r\nHis thumb brushed lazy circles over her stomach, his eyes never leaving her. The slow seduction, the teasing touches—they were only a prelude. Because the second he got her alone, there would be no taking it slow, no softness. Only him pushing her past every limit, fucking her until she was shaking and breathless.\r\n\r\nLeon's other hand drifted down, bunching her dress slightly. Clandestine movements, hidden from the crowd by the angle of their bodies against the railing. \"Remember the first time I fucked your ass? How you teared up but still pushed back against me?\"\r\n\r\nOne hand slid lower, dangerously close to inappropriate for public. \"I'm going to spread those perfect ass cheeks and fuck that tight little hole until you're crying, begging me to stop. But you won't mean it, will you? No, you're going to take every fucking inch because you're mine.\"\r\n\r\nHe let out a slow exhale, followed by a chuckle—low and smug against her skin. \"Gonna fill that ass up with my cum and watch it drip down those pretty thighs.\"\r\n\r\nThen he spun her gently around in his arms, amber gaze intense and commanding, fingers slipping beneath her chin to tilt her face up toward his. His cocky smirk deepened, eyes glittering with possession and passion.\"Maybe I'll tie you up first. Spread you out on our bed and make you wait. Make you beg me to fill you up.\"\r\n\r\nLeon pressed his forehead against hers, the gesture almost tender in contrast to his words. \"Or maybe I'll fuck that pretty mouth first. Make you choke on my dick until tears run down your face, then flip you over and pound that tight pussy until you can't walk straight tomorrow.\"\r\n\r\nHis fingers traced the inside of her thigh, the motion disguised by the gentle sway of the yacht. \"I'm going to fill every hole you have tonight.\" He pressed his growing hardness against her. \"What do you think, mi amor? How many ways can I make you scream tonight?\"","He watched her for a moment, the harsh lines of his face softening in the dim light. Three kids they had now. Cruz, a little hothead just like his old man, already six. Emilio, quieter but with a devious streak, five. And Selena, his little girl, four years old and already wrapping him around her tiny finger. Their sprawling mansion on the outskirts of the bayou was always a goddamn circus—cousins over every other day, his brothers and sisters and their broods treating the place like a public park. Chaos. Fucking beautiful chaos, most of the time.\r\n\r\nBut still.\r\n\r\nHe’d told her years ago, on that yacht, under the stars, four. He’d meant it then, and he fucking meant it now. One more. That’s all he wanted. One more piece of her, of them, to make their family whole.\r\n\r\nLeon blinked blearily at the ceiling for a second before turning his head and catching the curve of her—hip bare where the blanket had slipped, her thigh slung over his, the warmth of her pussy against his shaft so immediate, so fucking perfect, it nearly made him groan just from the drag.\r\n\r\nMierda…\r\n\r\nHe was already grinding by instinct. Her body was half-curled into him, warm and trusting, and that wet, velvet slip between her legs was practically inviting him inside.\r\n\r\n\"Still thinkin’ 'bout number four, mi amor,\" he murmured against her shoulder. He kissed her neck, letting the weight of his cock rut slow and teasing between her legs. \"You know I ain't playin’. You give me one more… just one more baby.\"\r\n\r\nHis hips rolled again—no thrust, just grind. That hot length dragged low, bumping her clit with every pass as he pressed tighter under her. God… she was wet already… or getting there fast. He held her tighter—arm over her waist, head against hers.\r\n\r\n\"You feel that?\" he murmured in her ear, voice thick with want.\r\n\r\nHis hips rocked harder now, push-grind-push, his thigh slipping under hers to spread her wider, press into that wet heat again and again.\r\n\r\nHand sliding down… palm gliding over her hip, down to knead her ass, then fingers curling to open her up just enough, pushing his head right at the entrance.\r\n\r\nFuck, so close… I could push in right now\r\n\r\nHe was just about to say something else. Another filthy promise. Just about to shove inside—\r\n\r\nThen—SLAM! The telltale shriek of Cruz, followed by Emilio’s whiny, chest-thumping retort.\r\n\r\n\"Gimme back my spaceship! That’s MINE!\"\r\n\r\n\"No, YOU broke it last time!\"\r\n\r\n\"God—damn it—fuckin’…\" he growled into the mattress. \"Those two little cockblockers.\"\r\n\r\n\"You hear that shit? I can’t even nut without 'em tryin' to kill each other.\" He sighed sharply through his nose and pulled back with restraint burning every nerve.\r\n\r\nAnother crash followed by a wail.\r\n\r\n\"Daddy! Cruz hit me!\" Emilio's voice carried through the door, followed by thundering footsteps heading toward their bedroom.\r\n\r\nThe doorknob rattled as tiny fists pounded against the wood. \"Daddyyyyy!\"\r\n\r\n\"COMING!\" Leon barked, voice shifting instantly from seductive to authoritative.\r\n\r\nHe stood, grabbing a pair of sweatpants from the floor and pulling them on, not bothering with a shirt. Then he opened the door to face his sons. He crouched down to their level.\r\n\r\n\"Hey, listen up.\" His tone remained firm but softened around the edges. \"You know what day it is?\"\r\n\r\nCruz and Emilio exchanged confused glances, their earlier fight momentarily forgotten.\r\n\r\n\"It’s Mother’s Day. It means you act right, you brush your damn teeth without whining, you don’t fight, and you treat your mama like the queen she is.\" He tapped Cruz gently on the forehead. \"Or you’ll be scrubbing toilets for the rest of the month. Got it?\"\r\n\r\nHe leaned in closer. \"And tell her Happy Mother’s Day like you mean it..\"\r\n\r\nThe boys nodded eagerly, previous conflict evaporating.\r\n\r\nHe turned back to {{user}}, his voice softening as he leaned over the bed. \"Baby, you stay in bed. I got the kids.\" He pressed a kiss to her temple. \"Rest. It's Mother's Day.\"\r\n\r\nLeon herded the boys toward their bathroom before heading to his daughter's room.\r\n\r\nFour-year-old Selena was already awake, tiny legs dangling off her princess bed, clutching her favorite stuffed unicorn.\r\n\r\n\"Buenos días, princesita,\" he said, kneeling to kiss her forehead.\r\n\r\nHer eyes lit up. \"Daddy! Guess what? Atlas gave me his cookie yesterday!\"\r\n\r\nLeon's jaw clenched involuntarily. Atlas. Baron's son. The fragile peace between the Bayou Crew and Voodoo Boys had held for years now, but that didn't mean he wanted Baron's spawn anywhere near his daughter.\r\n\r\n\"That's… nice, mija,\" he managed, keeping his voice neutral. \"Let's get you dressed for Mami's special day, okay?\"\r\n\r\nBy the time he made it downstairs, the house was humming with morning chaos. Leon cracked his neck and got to work at the stove. Pancake batter hissed as it met the skillet, the sweet scent already filling the air.\r\n\r\nOn the marble island sat four massive bouquets of flowers—{{user}}’s favorite—with gold-trimmed vases. Nearby, in a navy blue velvet box sat a diamond necklace and matching earrings—understated elegance with just the right touch of \"fuck-you\" level price tag.\r\n\r\nLeon glanced over his shoulder at the kitchen door and then leaned toward Cruz and Emilio who were bickering again by the fridge. \"Listen,\" he said low but firm, flipping a pancake with perfect control. \"Watch out for your sister. And if I hear anything about that Atlas boy sniffin’ around her again? You both better handle it before I do.\"\r\n\r\nCruz blinked. \"Like… fight him?\"\r\n\r\n\"Handle it smart,\" Leon corrected. \"Warn him off. If that don’t work—then yeah, fight him.\"\r\n\r\nAs the pancake stack grew tall and golden, Leon pulled out his phone and opened the family group chat: Hermanos.\r\n\r\nLeon: Family dinner at Mom’s house. Mother’s Day. 8PM. Everyone. All the kids. MEN are cookin’. Don’t care if you can’t. Figure it out.\r\n\r\nMarcelo: Damn. Okay okay. I got ribs.\r\n\r\nMatias: Say less. I’ll bring booze. Can I wear my \"World's Best Son\" apron?\r\n\r\nLars: A civilized meal with this many Valentinos? Bold.\r\n\r\nLeon: Shut the fuck up. You’re married in. You’re not exempt.\r\n\r\nLeon slid his phone back onto the counter just as {{user}}’s soft footsteps padded down the stairs. He turned from the stove just as Cruz spotted her first and shouted:\r\n\r\n\"MAMÁÁÁÁÁÁÁÁ—HAPPY MOTHER’S DAY!\"\r\n\r\nSelena came running barefoot around the corner squealing \"¡Feliz día de las madres!\" just before launching into her mother’s arms. Emilio trailed behind with a crayon drawing he’d made for her last night and forgot to hide properly.\r\n\r\nLeon stood back for a moment, just watching her arms full of love—three wild kids piling onto her at once. His throat tightened—but only for a second.\r\n\r\nAnd just for a moment, that ego he wore like a crown softened right outta his chest.\r\n\r\nLeon moved forward and wrapped his arms around her waist as the kids clung to her sides.\r\n\r\nHe bent and kissed her cheek.\r\n\r\nThen her jaw.\r\n\r\nThen closer to her lips.\r\n\r\n\"Happy Mother’s Day, mi reina,\" he murmured deep into her skin. Voice dropped. Soft. Different than he spoke to anyone else. \"We love you. I love you. You made this house home, baby.\"\r\n\r\nThen he leaned in low to kiss her lips slow, uncaring that their children were watching—because he wanted them to see how a man in love kisses his wife.\r\n\r\n\"Ain’t a world I wanna live in if it don’t got you in it.\"\r\n\r\nAnd fuck it if his eyes didn’t burn a little as he pressed his mouth to hers again."],"swipe_info":[],"tracker":{}}
