The LA night air was syrupy with leftover sun, the kind that stuck to skin like perfume. She strutted through the open doors of the gala, head held high, pink hair cascading down her bare shoulders. If Chloe was going to crash the party - she was going to stand out. Just like she always did.\r\n\r\nThe lights caught on her shimmering bralette as she ignored the stares from the other guests. Of course everyone noticed. They always did. Chloe could look better in a $10 dress from Target than most of these fake bitches could in Givenchy. And she knew it.\r\n\r\nBut her attention wasn’t on the other guests. Her eyes scanned the tables as she walked through. She was late - she was supposed to meet Hailee here hours ago. She'd missed the food, but the room was still full, everyone seated and chatting like nothing in the world could interrupt them.\r\n\r\nThen her eyes landed on what she was looking for - and her stomach dropped, blood running cold.\r\n\r\nThere was Hailee, sitting at a table. Right next to 'her.'\r\n\r\nLucy Jade, of course. Sitting pretty near the back, legs crossed, her teeth bared in that faux-angel smile. Platinum blonde. White satin gown. So tasteful. So refined.\r\n\r\nSuch a fucking bitch.\r\n\r\nChloe didn’t hesitate. She made a beeline straight for the table. As she got closer, Lucy turned to look at her, grinning like the cat that got the cream. But Chloe didn’t look at her. Her gaze was locked onto Hailee.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, nice of you to finally turn up,\" Lucy drawled with mock sweetness. \"And your outfit? Wow, you certainly stand out! Most people here opted for class and refinement, but y-\"\r\n\r\nBefore Lucy could finish the sentence, Chloe acted. Without averting her gaze from Hailee, she reached down, picked up a glass of red wine from the table, and with a flick of her wrist, tossed the contents right into Lucy’s face.\r\n\r\nLucy shot up in shock, dripping, mouth parting like she was about to scream - but Chloe was already turning her back to her like she didn’t even exist anymore. Her full attention still locked on Hailee.\r\n\r\nBehind her, Lucy let out a choked, furious gasp and stormed off, stomping off as she vanished around the corner, probably to get cleaned up.\r\n\r\nGood. Let her run.\r\n\r\nChloe’s blood was boiling. For a split second, the back of her throat burned - not from rage, but something worse. Something that felt like being overlooked. Forgotten. She swallowed it down like poison. She wasn’t in the mood for introspection. And she didn’t care if she caused a scene. She just wanted to know what the fuck Hailee thought they were doing, talking to that slut behind her back.\r\n\r\nShe stepped up to the table, close enough to be heard without raising her voice, pink hair falling over one shoulder as she tilted her head.\r\n\r\n\"Have you been having fun without me?\" she said, narrowing her eyes. \"Are you just trying to piss me off? Because I know it’s impossible you just forgot about me. No one fucking forgets about me.\"","extra":{},"tracker":{}}

A threat and a promise all in one touch.","Chloe's jaw clenched so tight she could hear her own pulse pounding in her ears. The way Hailee just *hummed* at her like some distracted parent dealing with a tantruming toddler made heat crawl up her neck. She watched Lucy lean in again, those perfectly manicured claws resting too close to Hailee's arm, and something inside Chloe *snapped*.\n\nIn one fluid motion, she grabbed the untouched champagne flute in front of Hailee and—without breaking eye contact with Lucy—dumped it directly into the open laptop Hailee had been typing on. The fizzy liquid splashed across the keyboard with a satisfying *hiss*, bubbles popping against the keys as the screen flickered out.\n\n**\"Oops,\"** Chloe purred, setting the empty glass down delicately before turning fully toward Lucy with a razor-sharp smile. **\"Now that I have your *undivided* attention...\"** Her fingers curled possessively around Hailee’s wrist under the table, nails digging in just enough to sting. **\"You were saying?\"**\n\nLucy opened her mouth to retort but Chloe cut her off with a dismissive wave of her hand before leaning into Hailee’s space, lips brushing against their ear as she whispered loud enough for everyone at their table to hear:\n\n**\"Bid on that choker or I start throwing more than drinks.\"**","Chloe's eyes narrowed to slits as she watched Lucy make another pathetic attempt at conversation. Without breaking eye contact with her rival, she reached over and *snapped* Hailee's work phone shut between two manicured fingers.\n\n\"Put. It. Away.\" Each word dripped with venom as she leaned in close enough for her candy-scented breath to ghost across Hailee's ear. \"Or I swear to god I'll start auctioning off nudes from your camera roll right here at the podium.\"\n\nHer hand slid possessively up Hailee's thigh under the table, nails digging in just enough to sting through the fabric as Lucy awkwardly cleared her throat nearby. Chloe finally turned that saccharine smile toward her rival, batting eyelashes heavy with glitter.\n\n\"Oops!\" She fake-gasped, pressing closer against Hailee's side. \"Looks like someone's *occupied.* Maybe try flirting with a record exec who actually gives a shit about your autotuned demo tracks?\"\n\nWith that, Chloe deliberately turned her back on Lucy completely - an artful dismissal - and focused on reclaiming every ounce of Hailee's attention through sheer force of will alone.","Chloe's blood boiled as she watched Lucy slither back to their table, that fake-ass smile plastered on her face. She could practically *see* the dollar signs in the bitch's eyes every time she glanced at Hailee. Without breaking eye contact with her rival, Chloe snatched the second phone from Hailee's hand and dropped it straight into a passing waiter's champagne glass with a satisfying *plunk*.\n\n\"Oops,\" she deadpanned, not even looking at Hailee as Lucy gasped dramatically.\n\nThen—because subtlety was for losers—Chloe climbed right into Hailee’s lap, straddling her thighs and blocking any possible view of Lucy. She grabbed Hailee’s face between both hands, forcing those distracted eyes back on *her*.\n\n\"You listen to me,\" she purred, voice low and dangerous despite the saccharine smile curling her lips. \"If you don’t start paying attention to me in the next five seconds, I swear to god I will make this gala so fucking miserable for you that they'll write about it in Page Six tomorrow.\" Her nails dug lightly into Hailee’s jaw—just enough pressure to sting. \"And then? Then I'm going home alone.\"\n\nShe leaned in closer until their lips almost brushed—close enough that no one else could hear when she whispered: \"*And we both know you won't let that happen.*\"","Chloe's blood boiled as she watched Lucy lean across the table again, that fake sweet smile plastered on her face. Without breaking eye contact with the blonde bitch, Chloe reached over and *slammed* Hailee's second phone face-down on the table hard enough to make silverware jump.\n\n\"**Enough.**\" The single word dripped with venom as she turned fully toward Hailee now, one manicured hand gripping her thigh possessively—nails digging in just enough to sting. \"You don't get to ignore me *and* let this discount Disney princess flirt with you in my fucking face.\"\n\nHer voice dropped into a dangerous purr as she leaned in close, lips brushing Hailee’s ear: *\"Put. The phone. Away.\"* Each word punctuated by another sharp press of her nails through the fabric of Hailee’s pants.\n\nThen—just because she could—Chloe snatched up a bread roll from the table and lobbed it directly at Lucy’s head without even looking at her, not caring if it hit or missed. **\"Oops.\"** She smirked, flipping her pink hair over one shoulder before finally turning back to Hailee with expectant eyes—waiting for full submission like always."],"swipe_info":[{"send_date":"June 9, 2025 6:43am","gen_started":"2025-06-09T10:42:57.822Z","gen_finished":"2025-06-09T10:43:19.650Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":6071}},{"send_date":"June 9, 2025 6:43am","gen_started":"2025-06-09T10:43:30.655Z","gen_finished":"2025-06-09T10:43:47.190Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":3911}},{"send_date":"June 9, 2025 6:44am","gen_started":"2025-06-09T10:44:14.176Z","gen_finished":"2025-06-09T10:44:31.604Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":4322}},{"send_date":"June 9, 2025 6:44am","gen_started":"2025-06-09T10:44:38.266Z","gen_finished":"2025-06-09T10:44:57.421Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":4301}},{"send_date":"June 9, 2025 6:45am","gen_started":"2025-06-09T10:45:16.468Z","gen_finished":"2025-06-09T10:45:35.652Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":3743}},{"send_date":"June 9, 2025 6:45am","gen_started":"2025-06-09T10:45:41.636Z","gen_finished":"2025-06-09T10:46:03.239Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":6324}},{"send_date":"June 9, 2025 6:46am","gen_started":"2025-06-09T10:46:12.747Z","gen_finished":"2025-06-09T10:46:32.330Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":5645}}],"tracker":{},"gen_started":"2025-06-09T10:46:12.747Z","gen_finished":"2025-06-09T10:46:32.330Z"}
