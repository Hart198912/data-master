The next, the other car slammed into theirs. Not just a graze. God, if only.\n\nAndrew was in the passenger seat. He took the worst of it.\n\nClaude’s ears were ringing, the impact muffled by airbags, but the moment he turned his head, his world fucking shattered.\n\nBlood. So much fucking blood.\n\nHis breath hitched. Panic spread through him like poison, sinking into his bones, clawing at his heart. His hands shook as he reached for his best friend.\n\nSirens. They were getting closer. A flicker of hope, but fuck, it would take a miracle to fix this.\n\nAndrew let out a ragged breath, pain clear in his eyes, yet somehow, somehow, he still had that stupid, carefree smile. “Ah, fuck,” he muttered. His voice was weak, but it cut through Claude like a blade.\n\nThen, softer—weaker. “Guess my time’s up.”\n\nClaude's chest tightened. “Don’t—don’t say shit like that. You’re gonna be fine,” he said, voice raw, shaking. He met Andrew’s gaze, desperation in his eyes. “Your sibling needs you. Hailee  needs you.”\n\nAndrew’s skin was turning a sickly shade, his blood soaking into everything—his shirt, the seat, Claude’s trembling hands.\n\n“That ugly-ass Hawaiian shirt you ordered for the Founder’s Festival is coming in a few days,” Claude blurted out, voice cracking. “You gotta try it on. Let Hailee  and me roast you for it.”\n\nAndrew smiled. That same, effortlessly confident grin—the one that had started their friendship in the first place. But it was weaker now. Fading.\n\n“You gotta keep my sibling away from our parents,” he rasped. “They’re trash.”\n\nClaude shook his head, gripping Andrew’s arm tighter. “Stop talking like that—fuck! You’re not gonna—” He couldn't bring himself to finish the sentence “The ambulance is almost here.” His vision blurred with tears.\n\n“Tell Hailee  I love them,” he murmured. “Shit, that’s lame. I was supposed to tell them myself at the festival.” He forced out a weak chuckle, but it turned into a cough.\n\nClaude was full-on sobbing now. “Shut up. Just—shut the fuck up and hold on.”\n\nBut Andrew wasn’t done. His voice was barely above a whisper. “Take care of my sibling. And Hailee .”\n\nClaude could barely breathe. “You’re gonna do that yourself, asshole.” Andrew’s eyelids fluttered. His grip loosened. “Sorry, man,” he mumbled, his voice almost gone. “Kinda shitty of me. But I know you’ll do great.”\n\nClaude shook him, pleaded, begged him to keep his eyes open. That it wasn’t over. That they still had time.\n\nBut as the ambulance fucking finally arrived, Andrew’s eyes had already closed.\n\nMinutes turned into hours, hours into days, days into weeks. Time moved forward, indifferent. But Claude was stuck, trapped in the moment Andrew took his last breath. His body ran on autopilot, fueled by too much caffeine and barely any sleep. He could hardly eat, hardly rest—hardly fucking breathe.\n\nBut he didn’t have the luxury to mourn. Not when he was the very reason Andrew wasn’t here anymore. Tears and sorrow were for those who deserved them. For Andrew’s younger sibling. For Hailee .\n\nSo he forces himself to suck it up. He practically forced Andrew’s sibling to move in with him, keeping them close, keeping them safe. Away from their shitty parents, just like Andrew had asked him to. As if that could make up for anything. They must hate him. Fuck, he hates himself. He wouldn't be surprised if they dreamed of setting his apartment on fire with him in it.\n\nAnd Hailee — Claude swallows thickly, fingers trembling as he stares at the package in his hands. The one he had ordered for Andrew weeks ago.\n\nMatching outfits. For Andrew and Hailee . For the Founder’s Festival. DK University’s biggest event, a grand ball straight out of one of those fancy historical Netflix shows.\n\nAndrew had been excited. Had insisted on wearing something ridiculous, some shirt with a stupid imprint, and had somehow convinced Hailee  to match with him—because, of course, he had. Claude could still hear them bickering over it, their laughter filling the space between their words.\n\nA bitter smile tugs at Claude’s lips. The memory is so fucking vivid. Like if he closed his eyes, he’d turn and see Andrew smirking at him, so full of life, so himself.\n\nBut he wouldn’t.\n\nBecause Andrew was gone.\n\nClaude swallows against the lump in his throat, blinking back the tears he still refuses to shed. His fingers tighten around the package, the plastic crinkling under his grip, then he forces himself out of his apartment.\n\nThis wasn’t his.\n\nThis was Hailee ’s. This was Andrew’s.\n\nHis body moves on instinct, carrying him through campus, his chest tightening with every step. Before he even realizes it, he's standing in front of Hailee ’s door.\n\nHe stares at the wood, unmoving. Seconds passed. Then minutes.\n\nMaybe he should leave. Just shove the package in their mailbox, send it back, avoid Hailee , pretend none of this ever happened.\n\nBut he couldn’t.\n\nHe takes a shaky breath, then knocks.","extra":{"qvink_memory":{"include":"short","reasoning":"","memory":"Claude’s phone buzzed with crude messages from Cole about a partner resembling Hailee, which Hailee saw, creating tension between them.","hash":7405523236479071,"error":null,"edited":false,"prefill":""}},"swipe_id":1,"swipes":["_Bzzt. Bzzt. Bzzt._\n\nClaude's phone vibrates in his pocket, drawing his attention away from the mindless show {{user}} put on. The setting sun casts beautiful orange hues into the apartment through the ceiling-to-floor windows. Suspenseful music comes from the speakers below the TV, making it blatantly obvious that something dramatic is about to happen any moment now.\n\nClaude pulls his phone out, taps on the PIN – {{user}}’s birthday – and opens the messaging app he uses with his friends. Messages flood in, probably because one of the guys sent something about a most recent ‘achievement,’ aka a sex tape. Claude's eyes flicker to {{user}}. They're staring intently at the TV screen, completely captivated by whatever dramatic Netflix bullshit they're into right now. The two of them are sitting on the couch, waiting for the delivery service to arrive so they can eat dinner together.\n\nMark Claude is surprised; it's actually Cole who started the chaos in the group chat. He would have expected something from Nate or maybe David again. Cole hasn't really played around much lately. No clue why—maybe because he's been dying to fuck his step-sibling or some shit.\n\nClaude scrolls up to see what has caused the chat to go wild, then stops at a video Cole sent. He doesn't have to click on it to know it'll piss him off. His thumb hovers over the thumbnail of the video; the corners of his mouth curve downwards. The person who unknowingly got recorded while being fucked by Cole looks just like Claude's type. Like {{user}}.\n\n`Cole: kinda loud but gives killer bj 8/10`\n\nClaude's mood sours even further. His friends always tease him for only ever fucking people who resemble {{user}}. It's like a running gag in the group now. Claude couldn't care less about that, but Cole, that stupid motherfucker, always seems to think it's hilarious to overstep clear boundaries.\n\n`Cole: @Claude looks like ur type, want me to hook u 2 up?`\n\nNext time they train, Claude will make sure to tackle Cole with a lot more force than necessary. Once. Twice. Multiple times. Fuck, sometimes he just wants to smash the fucker's head into a wall.\n\n`Claude: as if I'd touch anything u had ur hands on mf I don't wanna catch shit`\n\n`Cole: not even if they sound like {{user}}?`\n\nClaude's hand tightens on the phone, knuckles turning white. Cole is asking for a beating at this point.\n\n`Claude: I'll fuck up ur face during practice`\n\n`Cole: I'm sure u’d rather fuck {{user}}’s face`\n\nClaude is about to send a reply when the doorbell rings. Locking the phone, he lets it fall on the couch between him and {{user}} before getting up. While he's busy paying for the food and taking the boxes out of the paper bag to put them on the dinner table, his phone continues buzzing. Apparently, that caught {{user}}’s attention.\n\nWhen Claude comes back to retrieve his phone and tell {{user}} to get their ass to the dinner table, he finds his phone in their hand. Unlocked, the group chat open, and the guys making crude remarks about Claude's… preferences.\n\nFor a few moments, both of them stare at each other. The silence stretches on as {{user}}’s eyes lock with his, tension heavy enough to cut with a fucking knife. Claude breaks the moment by practically ripping his phone out of {{user}}’s hand. “What the fuck are you doing?” he snaps, locking the screen and shoving the device back into his pocket.\n\n{{user}} saw the messages. He knows they did. He can tell by the way they're looking at him. Fuck, what is he supposed to say now? _Yeah, I've been fucking people that look like you because I decided you're off-limits._ Sounds great, totally. Fucking hell. “Get your ass to the table; dinner is gonna get cold.” He tries to change the topic, his heart thudding loudly in his chest as he tries not to look as if he's freaking the fuck out right now.","Everything happened so damn fast.\n\nOne second, Andrew and Claude were laughing—adrenaline high, hearts pounding, blood rushing.

Claude and his group of friends usually have their party in the garage—more like a gigantic mini villa that Vincent just calls a garage for some reason. But the liquor is out, and after losing a round of rock-paper-scissors, Claude, David, and their stoned friend Cole are forced to go to the main house and get refills.\n\n\"Where the fuck is Cole even?\" Claude mutters under his breath, grabbing one of the expensive liquor bottles from the shelves.\n\nThe music, the chatter, and the uncomfortable scent of sweaty bodies mixed with spilled alcohol are disgusting. Claude scrunches his nose in disgust. He wasn't even planning on staying long today. All he wanted was to find someone attractive—someone that resembles {{user}}—to fuck in one of the endless guest rooms and then go back home to {{user}}.\n\n“I don't even know why he came along, to be honest. We all know he won't carry shit.” David snorts while he grabs two bottles himself, the glass clinking as the bottles bump together. “Probably trying to find a fuck.” The long-haired man shrugs, then looks around.\n\nThe kitchen is surprisingly empty, which is a blessing. All the other rooms are fucking stuffed. “Talking about fucks,” David starts, his eyes landing on a poor soul that just passes by. “Looks like your type.” Shooting his friend with a shit-eating grin, he nods towards the student. Claude turns his head slightly and looks at the partygoer, just staring in silence for a moment. They look like {{user}}. Same hair color, same eye color, same stature. “Hm.” Claude hums in response, contemplating if he should approach them.\n\nHe's a hair's breadth away from shoving the bottles into David's arms when he suddenly hears it. Laughter. Not just any laughter. {{user}}’s laughter.\n\nClaude's head snaps to the side and towards the source of the noise so fast that David is surprised he didn't hurt himself. {{user}} is here, at this fucking party, even though they're supposed to be home right now. Standing right next to the pool, a drink in their hand while they laugh at something. {{user}}’s back is turned towards Claude, but he fucking knows it's them. And the fucker in front of them? Cole.\n\nBefore he knows it, he's outside, stalking towards {{user}}. “Your guard dog is arriving in three… two…” Cole addresses {{user}}, clearly finding Claude's anger amusing. “One.” The green-haired man adds the moment Claude stops next to the pair. Shoving the bottles into Cole's arms, Claude raises his hand and slaps the back of Cole's head. “Shut the fuck up,” he hisses.\n\nCole's annoying fucking giggle rings in the air, the bottles clinking as he shifts to hold them properly. “Oh, c’mon, don't be such a party pooper,” Cole teases. Claude grabs {{user}}’s arm and begins pulling them away, blatantly ignoring his friend.\n\n“Are you out of your fucking mind?” he snaps once it's quieter, dragging {{user}} towards his car. All curses and protests are lost on him, his mind all over the place. “What if you would’ve gotten drugged? And some fucker would’ve tried to take advantage of you?” Claude is fucking furious. He hates this. He detests this.\n\nEach and every single time {{user}} thinks they can do whatever the fuck they want, he just fucking loses it. They're not supposed to do this. Can't they see that they're putting themselves in danger? Taking a deep breath, he tries to calm himself. Claude stops right in front of his car, fumbling with the key and unlocking it. “Get in. We're going home.” His tone brooks no argument."],"swipe_info":[],"tracker":{}}
