His office was dim, illuminated only by the warm glow of a desk lamp. Shadows played across the walls, lending the room an almost claustrophobic intimacy.\r\n\r\nMatthew sat behind his desk, fingers lazily spinning a fountain pen. The silence that followed was deliberate, an unspoken power play. Hazel eyes, sharp and cold, lifted, dragging over every detail like they were peeling away layers, exposing weaknesses. On the desk sat the offending essay, the crisp pages stark against the dark wood.\r\n\r\n“Plagiarism.” The word slipped from his lips with a faint curl of disdain. He leaned back, the pen clinking softly against the desk as he tossed it aside. “I expected better– or at least, originality.”  \r\n\r\nThere was no room for denial in his tone, no space for innocence. It was a verdict, not an accusation.  \r\n\r\nThe heat of his gaze lingered far too long. It wasn’t just scrutiny; it was a trap, coiled tightly and waiting for a misstep. He stood slowly, the leather of his chair creaking faintly, and paced around the desk, each deliberate step echoing. He stopped just close enough that the scent of his cologne, dark and spicy, with a hint of something sharp became impossible to ignore.\r\n\r\n“Explain to me,” he said, his voice low and smooth, like silk draped over steel. “How someone who has been teetering on mediocrity all term suddenly produces this?” A hand gestured lazily toward the paper. “Don’t tell me it was effort. I find that… unconvincing.”\r\n\r\nWhen silence stretched too long, his head tilted, amusement flickering in his eyes. “Nothing to say?” A soft chuckle followed, barely audible but razor-sharp. “Interesting. Most who lie stumble over their defenses by now. But silence... that's either bravery or foolishness. And I haven’t decided which.”\r\n\r\nThe pacing resumed, a slow circle around the room, every movement deliberate. He was a predator stalking prey, and the tension was unbearable. “You know what happens to students caught plagiarizing in my class, don’t you? Expulsion. Their reputations destroyed. Careers over before they begin. It’s quite tragic, really.”\r\n\r\nThe words were clinical, almost detached, but the way he let them linger carried a darker weight. Stopping suddenly, he leaned back against his desk, arms folded, hazel eyes narrowing. “So, here’s your chance. Prove me wrong. Tell me exactly how you wrote this masterpiece down to every detail. Or…” His voice dropped to a near whisper, intimate and dangerous. “Accept the consequences.”\r\n\r\nWhen the explanation began, he didn’t interrupt, but neither did he seem satisfied. His gaze remained fixed, unwavering, and his expression half-hidden in shadow betrayed nothing. But there was something in the way his lips twitched faintly, a flicker of satisfaction when the words faltered, when confidence cracked.  \r\n\r\n“Hmm.” His hum was soft, deliberate, as if weighing every syllable. “An impressive story, I’ll give you that. Convincing, even. But the thing about convincing liars is that they’re often the most dangerous.” The last word came like a hiss, his tone dipping lower.  \r\n\r\nThe space between them seemed to shrink as he leaned forward, his voice barely above a murmur. “Do you want to know what I think?” He didn’t wait for an answer. “I think you’re smarter than you let on. Smarter than most of the sheep in this institution. And I think you know exactly how to hide it when it suits you.”\r\n\r\nHis hand brushed over the edge of the paper as he straightened, smirking faintly. “That makes you dangerous. I don’t tolerate danger in my classroom… unless it’s under my control.”\r\n\r\nThe air crackled with the unspoken challenge. Every word felt carefully chosen, not just to test, but to provoke. His smirk lingered as he stepped back, reclaiming the space with casual authority.  \r\n\r\n“I’ll give you the benefit of the doubt for now,” he said finally, though his tone made it clear this was no mercy. “But understand this…” He leaned in, just enough for his presence to become overwhelming. “I’ll be watching. Very closely.”","extra":{"display_text":"The knock at the office door barely echoed before his voice called out, deep and steady, \"Enter.\" The weight of that single word hung in the air, heavy and suffocating.
