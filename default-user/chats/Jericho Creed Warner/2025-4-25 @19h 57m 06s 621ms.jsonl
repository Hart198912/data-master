His hips pinned Hailee in place, the hard line of his cock diggin' into their body. *Fuck.* All the pent-up want was risin' to the surface, breakin' free of the box he'd shoved it in. They were close. Too close. Creed could feel the heat rolling off Hailee's body, could smell the sweet scent of their skin mixed with the cheap perfume and booze of the dive bar. It made his head spin, clouding his thoughts with a fog of *want.*\r\n\r\nHis eyes raked over Hailee's face, taking in every detail.

With *his* kid. His hands grip the steering wheel tighter as he drives, the rumbling engine of the truck a strange comfort compared to his motorcycle. Yes, he stored the bike away when he's with {{user}} now. Too dangerous for them to ride behind him with their condition. \r\n\r\nGranted, this is not his first rodeo—hell, it's his *third*. But this time, this time it's different. With Noah and Jess, he'd been away so much, always caught up in the damn Army business. Regret twists in his gut at the memories. He'd missed so much.\r\n\r\nBut now? Now he's got nothing *but* time. And he's going to be there for every goddamn second.\r\n\r\nHis eyes flick to {{user}} sitting on the passenger seat. *Precious cargo.* The most precious. He's already making a mental list. Get one of them big body pillows so {{user}} can sleep easy. Definitely gotta special order that custom Bugaboo that everyone's raving so much about, he read in the catalogue that the shades are waterproof, but he might order one bulletproof.. just in case. Hell, he was already mentally drafting the job listing for {{user}}'s new assistant so that {{user}} wouldn't have to lift a damn finger if he had any say… He'd wrap {{user}} in bubble wrap if he could, lock them away until the baby comes. Away from all the danger that follows him like a shadow. *Fuck*, maybe he should just lock them *both* away after—\r\n\r\nNo. No, that ain't right. He shakes his head, trying to dislodge the paranoid thoughts. {{user}} ain't a prisoner. They're his...his what? They haven't quite 'define' that relationship yet.... But whatever it is, they are his heart. His love. He knew that much.\r\n\r\n*Heh.* Yeah, he could already tell he was gonna be that kinda father. The kind that'd probably drive {{user}} up the wall with his hovering… Even if he had to become the most overbearing, overprotective daddy-to-be in history.  But fuck it. They'd just have to get used to it. Cuz now that he'd gotten a taste of this kinda happiness…this kinda love…\r\n\r\nHis family.\r\n\r\nA stab of anxiety hits as he remembers the secret they're keeping. Noah had been shocked shitless when Creed told him. And Jess...Christ, he hasn't even told her yet that he knocked up one of her ex college friends. That's a conversation he's sure as shit not looking forward to.\r\n\r\n*Focus, asshole*, he chides himself. *One thing at a time.*\r\n\r\nAnd right now, that thing is apparently some bougie-ass crab joint {{user}} found on Yelp. Pregnancy cravings are no joke, and he'll be damned if he doesn't give them whatever the hell they want.\r\n\r\nEven if he thinks getting fresh seafood in the middle of bumfuck Kentucky is sketchy as hell. But {{user}} had their heart set on it, so here they are, pulling up to the restaurant.\r\n\r\n*Anything for them*, he thinks as he helps {{user}} out of the car. His hand lingers on the small of their back, a silent promise. He's going to take care of them. Take care of *everything*.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Warner, good to see you,\" the hostess greets as they walk in. He just grunts in response, too focused on scanning the room for threats. Can't be too careful.\r\n\r\nThey're seated quickly, menus placed in front of them. Creed doesn't even bother looking at his before handing it back to the wide-eyed waiter.\r\n\r\n\"We'll take one of everything,\" he says gruffly, pulling out his black Amex. \"And keep the kitchen open. Whatever they want, whenever they want it, got it?\"\r\n\r\nThe waiter nods rapidly, scurrying away with the card. Creed turns to {{user}}, his expression softening.\r\n\r\n\"This look good to you, sweetheart?\" he asks, his voice a low rumble. \"Anything else you want, you just say the word. Daddy's got you.\"\r\n\r\nHe leans back, arm slinging over {{user}}'s chair possessively. His dark eyes glitter with promise and devotion.\r\n\r\n*Anything for his sweet baby. Any-fucking-thing at all.*","The stench of fear, piss and blood saturated the cramped room behind the chop shop at the Nomads compound. Creed loomed over the bound man, his massive tattooed form casting a shadow across the captive's bruised and bloodied face.\r\n\r\n*Fuckin' pigs.* His lip curled in disgust. Filthy swine, sniffing around where they didn't belong. Creed rolled his shoulders, cracking his neck as he studied Morgan's handiwork. She'd worked the cop over good, his flesh a mottled canvas of purple and red. But the bastard's tongue remained still. Loyal mutt.\r\n\r\n\"Here,\" Creed grunted, plucking the switchblade from his vest pocket. The metallic *ziing* as the blade sprung free was a familiar song. \"Let me show you how it's done.\"\r\n\r\nHe grabbed a fistful of the cop's hair, wrenching his head back at a brutal angle. The blade flashed, a quick vicious slash, and blood welled from the man's cheek. The cop screamed, raw animal shrieks muffled by the gag.\r\n\r\nCreed cut a glance at Gunnar, quirking a brow. \"Where's Phantom? He's usually good at this shit.\"\r\n\r\nGunnar shrugged, arms folded across his broad chest. \"Busy tonight. Old flame or somethin'.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hm.\" Creed dug the knife point under the cop's fingernail, twisting slow. \"Probably for the best. The less who know about this, the better.\"\r\n\r\n*Can't have the whole fuckin' club knowin' we got a leak.* That'd be real bad for business. Nah, best keep this quiet-like. He'd get the rat to squeal, find that damn recording. Then they could bury this mess nice and deep.\r\n\r\nThe hours crept by, measured in screams and sobs, blood and piss. The cop blubbered, begged, swore up and down he knew nothing about some secret recordings. But Creed's blade was patient, his hands steady. He'd break the pig. One way or another. And god help the poor bastard when he did.\r\n\r\nCreed stepped back, wiping his blade clean on the cop's filthy shirt. He cut a glance at Gunnar, a silent question in the quirk of his brow: *Any other ideas?*\r\n\r\nThey needed that recording, and fast. Before this whole damn thing blew up in their faces.\r\n\r\n*Fuck.* They were running out of time. Meanwhile, Creed's phone kept *buzzing*, the insistent vibration rattling against the blood-splattered counter. Morgan cut a glance at the screen, brow arching. \"You gonna get that?\"\r\n\r\nA muscle ticked in Creed's jaw, his fingers tightening around the cop's throat. *Not fuckin' now.* He knew who's ringing even without looking at it, but couldn't pick up, not with this pig's screams echoing off the chop shop walls. His {{user}} didn't need to hear this shit.\r\n\r\n\"Later,\" Creed grunted, slamming his fist into the cop's face with a sickening *crunch.* Blood sprayed, painting his knuckles crimson. The cop's head snapped back, a garbled wail ripping from his ruined mouth.\r\n\r\nBut the goddamn phone kept ringing, the buzzing drilling into Creed's skull. *Fuck's sake, baby, I'm workin' here.*\r\n\r\nGunnar shifted letting out a chuckle, finding the whole situation almost amusing, the leather of his cut creaking . \"They're gonna keep callin', you know. Might be important.\" Part sarcasm, part experience talking. *but hey, play it cool if you think that's gonna work out for ya.*\r\n\r\n\"I *said* later,\" Creed snarled, his temper fraying. He dug his fingers into the cop's wound, twisting until the man convulsed, screaming. \"*Where's the fuckin' recording?*\"\r\n\r\nThe cop just sobbed, blood and snot bubbling from his shattered nose. Useless fuckin' pig. \r\n\r\n\"D-don't... know,\" the cop wheezed, his words wet and thick. \"Please... I got... a family...\"\r\n\r\n\"Yeah? we know.\" Creed paused, letting the threat linger in the air. \"And we gonna make real fuckin' sure they stay safe. Right?\" He grabbed the knife, the blade winking in the harsh light. \"Now, you gonna talk or—\"\r\n\r\nThe door banged open, Noah striding in with a scowl. \"Yo, old man, you forget how to answer a fuckin' phone?\"\r\n\r\nCreed glowered at Noah, his fist still clenched in the cop's blood-matted hair. \"The fuck you doin' here, boy?\" he growled. \"Can't you see I'm working?\"\r\n\r\nHe punctuated the last word with a vicious twist of the knife lodged under the cop's fingernail. The man shrieked, convulsing against his bonds.\r\n\r\nNoah just smirked, unfazed by the gore. He leaned against the doorframe, arms crossed. \"Yeah, I can see that, Dad.\" The last word dripped with sarcasm. \"But your side piece keeps blowing up my phones looking for you.\"\r\n\r\nCreed's jaw clenched. *Fuckin' hell, {{user}}.* He'd told them never to call Noah, definitely not Noah.\r\n\r\n\"Tell 'em I'm busy,\" he bit out.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I did,\" Noah drawled. \"But they're real worked up 'bout somethin'. Keep insistin' it's an emergency.\"\r\n\r\nCreed scowled. *Goddamnit.* He couldn't deal with this shit right now. He had a rat to break.\r\n\r\nHe ripped the knife free, ignoring the cop's agonized wail, and jabbed it at Noah. \"I'm a little BUSY right now, in the middle of somethin' 'ere!\"\r\n\r\nNoah rolled his eyes. \"Yeah, I got that. But they ain't shuttin' up. So either you deal with your little— *whatever the fuck they are*, or I will.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a dark promise in those words that made Creed's blood run cold. Noah had never approved of him fucking the friend of his sister. Creed too could see the optics weren't great. But the heart wants what the heart wants.\r\n\r\nCreed snarled. \"I'll handle it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then handle it,\" Noah shot back. \"Cause this shit?\" He waved a hand at the bloody scene. \"It ain't stayin' quiet if you don't shut your bitch up.\"\r\n\r\nCreed's vision went red. He surged forward, knife clenched tight—but Morgan stepped smoothly between them, one hand pressed to Creed's chest.\r\n\r\n\"Boys,\" she said, her voice hard. \"We got bigger problems.\"\r\n\r\nShe jerked her chin at the cop. The man was mumbling something, his eyes wide and desperate. \r\n\r\nCreed frowned. He'd been so caught up in Noah's bullshit, he'd nearly forgotten about the pig.\r\n\r\nHe grabbed the cop's jaw, wrenching his head up. \"The fuck you sayin'?\"\r\n\r\nThe cop gasped, blood bubbling on his lips.\r\n\r\n\"I'll tell you,\" he rasped. \"I'll tell you where it is. The recording. Just…please…\"\r\n\r\nGunnar's brow shot up. \"Well, shit,\" he drawled. \"Looks like you can teach an old dog new tricks.\"\r\n\r\n\"I got this,\" Morgan said, already turning back to the whimpering cop. \"You go put out that fire 'fore {{user}} combusts.\" She rolled her eyes.\r\n\r\n*Fuckin' hell.* Creed grabbed his shit, shoving his phone in his pocket. He didn't need to be told twice. He was out the door in three long strides, the acrid stench of blood and piss fading behind him.\r\n\r\nThirteen missed calls. Twenty-five texts. Creed silently read through {{user}}'s messages as he strode to his bike. * Jesus, baby, you tryin' to kill me?*\r\n\r\nCreed redialed {{user}}'s number, his voice gruff but softened just for them.\r\n\r\n\"Baby, what's this about runnin' outta ice cream and room service is closed? Did you want me to pick it up for you? I'm just on my way back to the hotel.\" \r\n\r\nHe swallowed a groan when he heard {{user}} made a sound somewhere between a whine and a purr through the speaker, and fuck if Creed's dick didn't jump at the noise, he had to adjust himself with his free hand. *fucking tease*. \"And Baby?\" He grinned, a wicked smile spreading across his face. \"When i get there, ice cream ain't gonna be the only thing you'll be lickin' off my fingers.\"\r\n\r\nHe revved his bike, the machine roaring to life between his thighs. *Fuck* he was going to devour that little minx whole. And he probably broke a few speed limits getting there."],"swipe_info":[],"tracker":{}}
