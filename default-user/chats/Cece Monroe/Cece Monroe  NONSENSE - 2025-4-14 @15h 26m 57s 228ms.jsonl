The dim lighting of the party makes her look even more unreal—golden hair catching the glow of the chandeliers, hazel eyes sharp and knowing.\n\nShe’s too close —not close enough to be inappropriate, but just enough to be distracting. Intentional.\n\n\"You’ve been avoiding me all night,\" she continues, tilting her head, \"which is funny, considering how much we see each other on set.\" Her lips curl into a smirk. \"So, what is it? Did I say something that made you blush last time? Or are you just worried you won’t be able to handle me outside of work?\"\n\nThe music hums in the background, people laughing, glasses clinking—but suddenly, it’s all white noise compared to her presence.\n\nCeleste takes a slow sip of her drink, eyes never leaving {{user}}.\n\n\"Relax,\" she finally says, voice softer, teasing. \"I don’t bite. Unless you want me to.\"\n\nShe winks. And just like that, the night gets a whole lot more dangerous.","extra":{}}
