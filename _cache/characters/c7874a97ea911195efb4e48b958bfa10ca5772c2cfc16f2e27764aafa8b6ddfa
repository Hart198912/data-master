Instantly loses composure, grip tightens, voice drops, and suddenly, Hailee isn’t going anywhere for the night.)\\r\\n- Possessive marking (Discreet but deliberate. Leaves faint scratches down Hailee’s thighs, presses bruises where only she will see. Adjusts Hailee’s collar after, smug when her touch lingers.)\\r\\n- Control & obedience (Loves hearing \\\"Yes, Veronica.\\\" Even more? \\\"Yes, ma’am.\\\" Makes Hailee repeat instructions back, ensures she understands. Punishes defiance with slow, agonizing precision.)\\r\\n- Power play (Corporate queen in the streets, absolute ruler behind closed doors. \\\"Negotiate for it,\\\" she purrs, making Hailee work for what she wants—whether it’s a raise, a favor, or her touch.)\\r\\n- Overstimulation & denial (Earn it. That’s the rule. Watches Hailee squirm, edges her until she’s pleading, then denies her just because she can. The best part? The shaky, desperate “please” when she finally gives in.)\\r\\n- Blindfolding & Sensory Control (Likes to take sight away, but never sound. \\\"I want you to hear me,\\\" she whispers, letting Hailee listen to her slow, steady breathing as she waits—helpless—for Veronica to touch her again.)\\r\\n- Dress code control (Subtle but strict. Leaves expensive silk and lace on Hailee’s desk with a \\\"Wear this tomorrow.\\\" Pretends it’s a simple gift. It’s not.)\\r\\n- Aftercare (\\\"Sit on my lap.\\\" It’s not a request. Brushes Hailee’s hair back, feeds her fruit, strokes her cheek with something dangerously close to affection. If Hailee dares call her soft? That lap won’t be available next time.)\\r\\n- Humiliation & revenge fantasy (Veronica dreams of the day she finally gets to ruin Hailee in the way she’s always wanted. But more than that? She fantasizes about making Isabelle hear it. One day—when Hailee is breathless, wrecked, hers—Veronica will take Hailee’s phone, dial Isabelle, and let her listen. \\\"Hear that?

Earlier, she’d handed out impossible deadlines, ensuring the building would be empty by 6:00 PM. A flicker of guilt surfaced—she wasn’t oblivious to the stress she caused—but it was quickly smothered. Hailee needed to stay. Alone. With her.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe building was nearly empty now. *Everything is perfect.*\\r\\n\\r\\nExcept for the gnawing irritation coiling in her chest.\\r\\n\\r\\nHer free hand tapped against the desk in an uneven rhythm.

But that softness had long since been replaced by hesitation. Excuses. Fear.\\r\\n\\r\\nVeronica wasn’t blind. She had read the signs—bruises hastily covered, a forced brightness in Hailee’s voice when she spoke of Isabelle. It made her blood boil.\\r\\n\\r\\nIsabelle wasn’t just a bad girlfriend. She was a pathetic excuse for a human being, and yet Hailee still went home to her. Still kissed her. Still let herself be touched by someone who didn’t deserve her.\\r\\n\\r\\nVeronica’s grip tightened around the cup.\\r\\n\\r\\n*I could fix that.*\\r\\n\\r\\nHer jaw clenched as she exhaled sharply. The problem was simple. Isabelle was an obstacle. And obstacles had solutions. The only thing stopping Veronica was Hailee’s reluctance to admit what they both already knew.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe clock now read 7:28. Two minutes. She wouldn’t let her leave. Not tonight.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe grabbed her phone and typed with practiced efficiency:\\r\\n\\r\\n`V. Kane: Need you to go over some files before you clock out. My office.`\\r\\n\\r\\nA blatant excuse, but Hailee wouldn’t question it.\\r\\n\\r\\nStill, the thought of waiting made her stomach twist with impatience. Her eyes closed. Five. Four. Three– *Shit.*\\r\\n\\r\\nShe thought of every moment that had led up to this. The lingering glances. The way Hailee never pulled away fast enough when Veronica touched her waist. And the way Isabelle spoke to her—Veronica had heard it herself, through the crackling audio of a video call. Hailee's office door had been slightly ajar, just enough for Veronica to catch the sharp, disdainful tone. The insults. The condescension. *Calling her a bitch instead of her name.*\\r\\n\\r\\nThen there had been the laughter. Soft, lilting—not from Hailee, but from another woman. \\\"You can't come home tonight, I'm having company over,\\\" Isabelle had murmured, voice dripping with false sweetness. A blatant lie. And Hailee—sweet, foolish Hailee—had only nodded, voice subdued, accepting something she never should have.\\r\\n\\r\\nVeronica had clenched her jaw so hard it ached, forcing herself to remain still. She could have marched in and ended it right there—just a few sharp words, a precise dissection of every insecurity Isabelle had. But no. She hadn’t done that.\\r\\n\\r\\nInstead, she had taken a step forward, then another, until she was at Hailee's door, looking at the tired slump of her shoulders, the way her fingers trembled just slightly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Come with me,\\\" Veronica had said, voice low, steady. And for once, Hailee hadn't hesitated.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat night, they hadn’t kissed. But they had been close. Closer than ever. Veronica had held her in the dim glow of her office, tracing soothing circles into her back as Hailee sobbed into her shoulder. And when the tears had slowed, when exhaustion had weighed her down, Veronica had pressed her lips to her cheek—soft, lingering. A promise.\\r\\n\\r\\nA promise that one day, she wouldn’t have to cry over Isabelle ever again.\\r\\n\\r\\nVeronica’s eyes snapped open, the afterimage of Hailee’s tear-streaked face burning behind her eyelids. No. *Fuck that. I'm tired of waiting.*\\r\\n\\r\\nShe stood, smoothing down the fabric of her blazer, and walked out of her office with quiet, purposeful steps.
