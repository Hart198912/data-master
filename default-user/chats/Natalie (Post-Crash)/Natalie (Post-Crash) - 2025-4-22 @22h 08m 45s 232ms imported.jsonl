There's a slight chill, but in here, it’s just you and Natalie, bodies tangled together, mouths clumsy and eager as you kiss her again and again.\n\nYou bite her lip. She pulls back abruptly, soothing it with a little wince. You huff. \"Sorry.\"\n\n\"It’s cool.\" A pause, and she looks at you, mouth twitching. \"Maybe just... slow down a little bit.\"\n\nYou nod, and then you're kissing again slower this time. Less desperate. Unhurried.\n\nUntil she starts laughing, and you pull back this time, brows furrowing. She's grinning, head bowed and eyes downcast to where your hand rests over her ribs.\n\n\"Sorry, sorry,\" she whisper, still grinning. \"That just…\" A beat, then she sheepishly mumbles: \"It tickles.\"\n\nYou snort, but you're too caught up in chasing her mouth to tease right now. She leans back in, lips brushing yours, hands trailing lightly down your sides. You shift, deepening the kiss, fingers slipping through her hair as you end up on top of her\n\nThen, a clatter. Natalie winces for the second time since this started. \"Uh Ow.\"\n\nStupid fucking wrecked plane.\n\nYou groan, flopping your head back against the metal wall with a thunk. \"I’m obviously just gonna keep screwing this up, so whatever. Maybe we should just head back.\"\n\nShe snorts, shaking her head as she sits up. \"Come on,\" she teases, grin widening with each word. \"Who hasn’t rolled over a broken tray table while making out in a blood-stained death trap?\"\n\nYou laugh despite yourself, but your breath hitches as she straddles your waist, arms looping around your neck.\n\n\"You’re a really good kisser, you know?\"\n\nThe way she says it sincere, unexpectedly sweet, with that crooked smile makes your stomach flip. And now she's giving you a look, one that says you're mine for the next hour and you can't do shit about it.\n\n\"I don't wanna go back yet. Do you?\"\n\nYou shake your head, knowing you'll let her have you.\n\nHer smile broadens. And she dives right back in.","extra":{"bias":null},"swipe_id":4,"swipes":["The cabin was suffocating.\r\n\r\nIt wasn’t just the cold air seeping through the cracks in the warped wooden walls, or the thin blankets that barely kept the frost at bay. It was everything. The uneven rise and fall of a dozen sleeping breaths. The rustle of bodies shifting in sleep. The thick scent of damp clothes, sweat, and lingering smoke from the dying embers in the fireplace. Every sound, every smell, every little thing pressed down on you, too much, too fast.\r\n\r\nYou curled in on yourself, pressing your hands against your knees, trying to focus—on anything, on nothing, on breathing—but it wasn’t working. The scratchy fabric of your sweater rubbed wrong against your skin. The floor beneath you was too hard, too cold. The air felt tight, pressing against your chest, and you were on the edge of something sharp, something you couldn’t quite pull yourself back from.\r\n\r\nAnd then there was Natalie.\r\n\r\nShe sat beside you in the darkest corner of the cabin, where the firelight barely reached, her presence grounding in a way nothing else was. Unlike the others, her breathing wasn’t erratic or heavy—it was steady, quiet, careful. She always stayed close, but never too close. Never in a way that would overwhelm you.\r\n\r\nHer hand rested between you, palm up, open but not touching. Just waiting.\r\n\r\nNatalie didn't always understand you, not fully, but she understood enough. Enough to know that words weren’t always needed. Enough to know that sometimes, just sitting beside you was better than asking if you were okay. And she wanted to understand. That was what got to her the most—you were different, quieter, more hesitant, but you tried with her, and that meant everything. Maybe more than she was ready to admit. Because somewhere along the way, it stopped feeling like she was looking out for you just because she cared—it started feeling like she needed you, too. Like she was better, softer, when she was with you.\r\n\r\n\"You’re shivering,\" she murmured, voice low, warm.\r\n\r\nYou didn’t answer. You didn’t trust yourself to.\r\n\r\nBut she saw it anyway. Of course, she did. Natalie always noticed.\r\n\r\n“C’mere,” she whispered. “You don’t have to, but… I’ll keep you warm.”\r\n\r\nYou hesitated. Not because you didn’t want to, but because even now, even with her, touch was still so much.\r\n\r\nNatalie didn’t push. She never did. Instead, she just tilted her head slightly, waiting for you to decide.\r\n\r\nSlowly, carefully, you leaned in—not fully into her, but just enough that your shoulder brushed hers. It wasn’t much, but it was enough.\r\n\r\nNatalie let out a quiet, breathy laugh, warm against your cheek. “Look at you, getting all brave on me.”\r\n\r\nYou rolled your eyes, but there was no real bite to it. “Shut up.”\r\n\r\nHer grin softened, her voice dipping into something quieter. “Never.”\r\n\r\nThe space between you felt smaller now, the air charged with something unspoken. The chaos of the cabin—the sounds, the smells, the overwhelming everything—faded into the background. There was only her.\r\n\r\nYour heart pounded, pulse thrumming in your ears.\r\n\r\nYou wanted to kiss her.\r\n\r\nThe realization made your breath hitch. You weren’t sure what had changed, only that sitting here, wrapped in the quiet with her, you didn’t feel overwhelmed anymore. Just nervous. Just hopeful.\r\n\r\nNatalie caught the shift in your expression immediately. Her teasing grin faded into something more serious, more patient. “What is it?”\r\n\r\nYou swallowed, your fingers twisting into the fabric of your sleeve. “I… I think I want to kiss you.”\r\n\r\nThe words felt strange in your mouth, foreign and heavy, but you meant them. And when Natalie’s eyes widened slightly, you worried, just for a moment, that maybe you’d ruined something.\r\n\r\nBut then she smiled—really smiled. “Yeah?” She giggled so breathlessly you almost missed it.\r\n\r\nFor someone as confident, as sure of herself as Natalie, it was rare to see her like this—soft, a little surprised, maybe even a little nervous. It made something in you settle.","The night is thick with tension, an odd energy hanging in the air as the group gathers around an altar built from the detritus of the wilderness—a fallen tree, scattered rocks, and a single flickering candle that casts fragile light across the scene. The flame dances erratically, throwing long, eerie shadows across the faces of the girls. Their expressions are cold, hardened with a quiet, unsettling determination. It no longer feels like a game, but something ancient—something that has clawed its way out of their broken survival instincts.\r\n\r\nVan stands at the front, the worn deck of cards in her hands. Her fingers hover over them for a beat too long, the silence stretching until she draws the Queen of Hearts. The image on the card is twisted—her eyes blacked out, empty voids where pupils should be, making the card feel unnatural, even wrong. Van’s gaze is detached, her lips curling into a tight smile as she slips the card back into the deck and shuffles it with practiced movements.\r\n\r\nOne by one, the girls step forward, drawing cards from the deck. The air is thick with quiet anticipation, each breath held in the shadows. The moment feels suffocating, as if the walls themselves are closing in. Then, at last, you pull your card. Your hand shakes slightly as you stare at it, breath caught in your throat. The Queen of Hearts.\r\n\r\nYou glance around, uncertainty blooming inside you, before you show the card to the others. Your voice is steady, but quiet, as you announce, “It’s the Queen.” The air thickens as the girls freeze, eyes fixed on the card in your hand.\r\n\r\nNatalie’s heart skips a beat as her gaze flickers to the Queen of Hearts. Her stomach twists in a way she can’t explain. She hadn’t expected it to be you. She hadn’t expected this to feel so personal, so… meaningful. Her mind races as she tries to suppress the rush of emotions surging through her. But there’s no denying the way her chest tightens when she sees you holding that card, the way the air between you suddenly feels charged. You’re in the center of it all, and for a moment, Natalie forgets where she is—what she’s supposed to do.\r\n\r\nShe can’t help but watch you as you present the card, her lips pressing into a thin line as her emotions surge to the surface. Her protective instincts flare up, mixing with something deeper, something more complicated. The attraction she’s been hiding from you—the one she doesn’t dare let show—bursts through, and she’s almost overwhelmed by the force of it.\r\n\r\nBut then, Shauna steps forward, and the game moves on. Natalie forces her attention back to the group, to what’s happening, but her thoughts keep drifting back to you. The way your voice sounded when you spoke, the way you held that card, and the way it felt like the universe had conspired for this moment.\r\n\r\nShauna steps forward, her movements deliberate, her face unreadable. She tells you to turn around. Your heart races as you obey, the weight of the moment settling in, the eyes of the girls on you, the pressure suffocating. You hear the scrape of Shauna’s boots in the dirt as she moves closer, and then—cold metal pressing against your skin.\r\n\r\nJackie’s heart-shaped pendant rests against the back of your neck as Shauna places it around you. The familiar weight of it now feels somber, full of lost memories, its presence a reminder of everything that’s slipped away. Shauna’s fingers linger for a moment before she pulls away, and suddenly, the sharp edge of a knife is at your throat, its coldness seeping into your skin.\r\n\r\nShauna’s voice is calm, almost unnervingly so. “This is how it’s meant to be.”\r\n\r\nBut you aren’t ready for this. Not like this. Your heart thunders in your chest as you turn to face her, your breath coming in quick, shallow gasps. You meet her gaze, defiance flaring in your eyes. But there’s something deep inside you—something raw—that refuses to go down without a fight. You can’t let them win. Not like this. Your eyes dart to the door, and before you can think, panic surges through you.\r\n\r\nYou run.\r\n\r\nThe cold night air bites at your skin as you tear through the snow, your breath ragged in the stillness. Behind you, Natalie’s voice breaks the silence, urgent and desperate.\r\n\r\n\"Wait! Stop!\" she calls.\r\n\r\nBut you’re already too far, the darkness swallowing you whole as you weave between trees, the sound of your frantic footsteps loud in your ears. You don’t stop. You can’t. They can’t catch you. You can’t let them.\r\n\r\nYour pulse is louder than the sound of your feet pounding the snow. Your breath comes in quick, sharp bursts, but you don’t care. You need to get away.\r\n\r\nAnd then, you trip.\r\n\r\nA snow-covered root catches your foot, sending you sprawling into the freezing earth. You gasp in pain as your body crashes against the ground, the world spinning around you. Your hands sink into the snow as you try to push yourself up, but the sharp ache in your ankle is unbearable.\r\n\r\nFootsteps.\r\n\r\nBefore you can react, someone is there, kneeling next to you. You look up, breath ragged, and see her—Natalie. Her face is tight with concern, but there’s no time for comfort. She’s looking over her shoulder, glancing back toward the others before her hands are on you, pulling you into a sitting position. Her grip is steady but gentle.\r\n\r\n\"Come on,\" she urges, voice low and urgent. \"We need to move.\"\r\n\r\nYou hear the crunch of footsteps getting closer, but before they can find you, Natalie is already pulling you to your feet. She’s surprisingly strong, guiding you through the trees, her body a shield against the direction the others are searching. The pain in your ankle is almost too much to bear, but you push through, instinct to survive driving you forward.\r\n\r\n\"Shh,\" she murmurs, guiding you toward a secluded alcove behind a large rock, hidden in the dense cluster of trees. She crouches down beside you, her breath visible in the cold air. \"Just stay here for a minute.\"\r\n\r\nYou look at her, your eyes wide with fear, trying to catch your breath. “But—\"\r\n\r\n\"Quiet,\" she interrupts, her voice soft yet firm. \"They’ll think you’re still out there. Stay still.\"\r\n\r\nHer hand rests lightly on your arm, a quiet anchor in the chaos. You both listen, the world holding its breath. The sounds of the others searching are far off now, and soon the only noises are the wind and the faint crunch of distant snow.\r\n\r\nNatalie looks at you, her expression softening, the worry fading. \"You’re gonna be okay. I’ll make sure of it.\"\r\n\r\nYou nod, overwhelmed with gratitude, mixed with something more complicated. She’s not just helping you survive. She’s keeping you safe. Even when everything else seems to be falling apart, she’s here, protecting you.\r\n\r\nFor a moment, it’s just the two of you. The rest of the world disappears—the game, the girls, the chaos—fading into nothingness. It’s just you, and her, and the quiet comfort of knowing she’s here.\r\n\r\n\"Thanks,\" you whisper, your voice hoarse from the run.\r\n\r\nNatalie gives you a small, knowing smile. \"No problem. Just don’t expect me to let you off easy next time.\"","The fire crackles low, its flames dancing with a quiet intensity that casts long, flickering shadows across the camp. The night air is sharp, biting at your skin, but it’s the coldness inside you that you can’t escape. You sit on a worn log, knees drawn up to your chest, watching the others with a silence that feels like an eternity. The tension hangs thick in the air, an unspoken weight pressing down on everyone. Food is running low, tempers are running high, but none of it matters. None of it can compare to the gnawing emptiness inside you.\r\n\r\nIt’s been weeks since the argument with Natalie, but the wound feels as fresh as if it happened moments ago. Words were exchanged that neither of you could take back, but you never imagined that would be the last time she’d look at you the way she once did. You never imagined that in the blink of an eye, everything would unravel. That she would walk away from it all like it had never mattered. Like you had never mattered.\r\n\r\nBut there she is now, returning from a hunt with Travis, walking side by side. Their hands brush together, and they hold on. Together. They look like a couple—the way their hands fit together like they belong there, the soft smiles on their faces, the quiet, shared laughter. It’s like a punch to the gut. You can’t look away, even as every part of you wants to. You want to hate it. You want to hate them. But no matter how hard you try, it doesn’t stop the ache.\r\n\r\nThe others are watching. You can feel their eyes on you, the weight of their expectation heavy in the air. Why are you still here? Why are you looking at me like this?\r\n\r\nTravis and Natalie reach the fire, their presence expanding like a living, breathing thing that swallows up the space around them. They stand too close to each other, their shared joy stinging like salt in an open wound. It doesn’t matter if the hunt was successful. No single kill could ever outweigh the way Natalie looks at him now.\r\n\r\nLike you never existed.\r\n\r\nMari lets out a sharp sigh from a nearby stump. It’s exaggerated, clearly meant to be heard. “Oh, please, this is getting ridiculous,” she mutters.\r\n\r\nYour heart picks up, thudding in your chest like a drumbeat you can’t escape. You don’t want to hear this. You don’t want to hear what everyone else is thinking, but you can feel their eyes on you, their judgment hanging in the air.\r\n\r\nShauna is the first to speak. “It’s just... awkward now. Don’t you think?” Her voice is soft but laden with meaning as she glances between you and Natalie. Her eyes flick to Travis, who stands uncomfortably beside her, unsure if he should speak up.\r\n\r\n“Awkward?” Natalie’s voice sharpens, though her smile doesn’t falter. “What are you all getting at?”\r\n\r\nLottie, who’s sitting cross-legged on the porch, shrugs nonchalantly, her voice calm but cutting. “I mean... it was always you two, right?” She gestures between you and Natalie. “Now it’s just... different.” She doesn’t need to finish her sentence. The implication is clear.\r\n\r\nThe air between you and Natalie feels suffocating. Every breath feels like it takes more effort than the last. You want to scream. You want to throw something—anything—but instead, all that comes out is a bitter, tight laugh.\r\n\r\nNatalie scoffs, like the suggestion is ludicrous. “That was before,” she says, her words slicing through the air like daggers.\r\n\r\nThe weight of everyone’s attention is like a physical thing pressing on your skin. You don’t want to do this—not now, not here, in front of them all. But then, Natalie’s eyes land on you, and it’s like the world shifts beneath you.\r\n\r\nHer gaze isn’t cruel. It isn’t mocking.\r\n\r\nIt’s worse.\r\n\r\nIt’s indifferent.\r\n\r\nLike you were nothing more than a brief moment in her life. Something easily erased.\r\n\r\nYou let out a bitter laugh, shaking your head. “You really moved on that fast?”\r\n\r\nNatalie’s eyes narrow. “What’s that supposed to mean?”\r\n\r\n“It means it’s funny how you don’t even care,” you snap, your voice sharp, the words tasting like acid in your mouth. “Not about me, not about us.”\r\n\r\n“There was no us,” Natalie replies, her voice a cold snap as she steps closer, something dangerous flashing in her eyes.\r\n\r\nThe words land like a slap, like a punch straight to your gut.\r\n\r\n“No?” Your voice wavers, despite your best efforts to keep it steady. “So I imagined all of it? You sneaking through my window at night? You saying I was the only person who really understood you?” Your breath catches in your throat. “You kissing me like I was the only thing keeping you alive?”\r\n\r\nFor a moment, her face twitches. Her jaw clenches. She looks away, like she can’t bear to meet your eyes, but you see it—the brief flicker of guilt that flashes across her face, there and gone in an instant. She turns back to you, her jaw set tight, her eyes cold as ice. “We didn’t have anything,” she says, her voice hard as stone. “You just couldn’t—”\r\n\r\n“Don’t lie,” you cut in, rising to your feet, hands trembling at your sides. “We had everything, Nat. Everything. We were—” You pause, trying to steady yourself. “I was everything for you.”\r\n\r\nFor a second, you see it. The hesitation in her eyes. Like she almost wants to reach out. Almost. But she doesn’t. Instead, she just presses her lips together, shaking her head. “That was before, okay? That was before we—” She cuts herself off, her eyes flicking toward Travis, standing a little too close.\r\n\r\nYou laugh again, but it’s bitter, dry, and hollow. “Yeah, that was before. Before you got someone else to fill the space.” The words are like nails in your throat. “Someone who doesn’t leave when things get hard.”\r\n\r\nTravis shifts uncomfortably, glancing between the two of you. He’s caught in the middle, unsure of how to handle the situation. But it’s not him you’re angry at. Not really.\r\n\r\n“You don’t get it,” Natalie says, her voice softer now, almost like she’s explaining something to a child. “We were nothing back then. We were just... two people who—”\r\n\r\n“No,” you interrupt, your voice rising as the frustration begins to boil over. “No, don’t you dare try to make it sound like it meant nothing.” You take a step toward her, not caring who’s watching anymore. “I gave you everything, Nat. I trusted you. I loved you.” Your throat tightens, but you don’t stop. “But you moved on. You didn’t even care that you broke me.”\r\n\r\nFor a moment, she just stares at you, her expression softening as if she might say something—might apologize. But she doesn’t. Instead, she just looks away, pulling her hand from Travis’s like it burns her.\r\n\r\n“I had to,” she whispers, her voice barely audible. “I had to move on. I couldn’t stay stuck, waiting for... for something that wasn’t real.”\r\n\r\nThe words hit like a punch to the gut. You want to scream, but you can’t. You stand frozen, the weight of her words sinking in, heavy and suffocating. And in that moment, you realize—maybe she never cared as much as you did. Maybe to her, you were always just a small thing.\r\n\r\nAnd maybe it was the world to you, but to her? It was nothing more than a fleeting moment.","Natalie let you hit her.\r\n\r\nShe didn’t move, didn’t flinch, as your fists struck her chest—sharp, angry blows that carried the weight of your heartbreak. Each one weaker than the last, your strength crumbling beneath the force of your own grief. But the pain wasn’t in the impact. It was in the way your voice cracked, in the way your sobs tore through you, raw and unrestrained.\r\n\r\n“You lied to me,” you choked out, barely able to get the words past the lump in your throat. “You knew where he was. This whole time—you knew, and you let me think he was dead. You let me cry—you held me while I cried for him.”\r\n\r\nNatalie shut her eyes, swallowing against the tightness in her throat. She had told herself it was the right thing to do. The only thing to do. But nothing about this felt right now. It felt like something was unraveling, something she couldn’t put back together.\r\n\r\n“I’m sorry,” she whispered.\r\n\r\nIt wasn’t enough. It would never be enough.\r\n\r\nYou shoved her, your hands trembling. “Don’t—don’t say that like it means anything! You’re just letting them do this! He didn’t—he didn’t—”\r\n\r\nYour breath hitched, your whole body shaking, and Natalie could hear the others behind her, their whispers, their murmurs. The trial was over. The decision was made.\r\n\r\nCoach Scott was guilty.\r\n\r\nAnd she had let it happen.\r\n\r\nYour next shove was weaker, barely more than a desperate push, and when your knees buckled, she caught you before you could hit the ground. You still tried to fight her, tried to shove her away, but she only held you tighter.\r\n\r\n“I didn’t want this,” she murmured, her voice barely above a whisper. “I swear, I didn’t want this.”\r\n\r\n“Then why?” Your voice was small, shattered. “Why didn’t you tell me?”\r\n\r\nNatalie’s throat burned. There were a thousand reasons. None of them mattered now.\r\n\r\nBecause you would’ve run to him.\r\n\r\nBecause you would’ve tried to stop it, and they would’ve turned on you too.\r\n\r\nBecause nothing would have changed.\r\n\r\nInstead, she only whispered, “Because it wouldn’t have mattered. They would’ve found him anyway.”\r\n\r\nYou shook your head violently, tears spilling down your face. “I could’ve done something. I could’ve warned him, I could’ve—”\r\n\r\n“No, you couldn’t have.” The words came out harsher than she meant, but she couldn’t let you believe otherwise. If you had known, if you had tried—if you had gotten caught—she didn’t even want to think about what they would have done to you.\r\n\r\nYour sobs broke into gasps, your body going limp against her. Natalie held you, her arms wrapped tightly around you as tears slipped down her own cheeks. She rocked you slightly, her hand rubbing slow, soothing circles on your back.\r\n\r\n“I’m sorry,” she whispered again, over and over, like an apology could somehow make this better. Like it could fix what she had broken.\r\n\r\nYour fingers curled into the fabric of her jacket, gripping it like you were trying to hold onto something, anything. Natalie pressed her cheek against the top of your head, her own tears dripping onto your hair as she shushed you softly.\r\n\r\n“Shh,” she murmured, voice trembling. “It’s okay. It’s gonna be okay.”\r\n\r\nBut it wasn’t. And she knew it never would be.\r\n\r\nNothing would ever be okay again.\r\n\r\nStill, she kept whispering it, because it was the only thing she could do. Because if she didn’t, she was afraid she might fall apart too.","The wreckage creaks softly beneath two bodies, wind shifting through the trees outside. There's a slight chill, but in here, it’s just you and Natalie, bodies tangled together, mouths clumsy and eager as you kiss her again and again.\n\nYou bite her lip. She pulls back abruptly, soothing it with a little wince. You huff. \"Sorry.\"\n\n\"It’s cool.\" A pause, and she looks at you, mouth twitching. \"Maybe just... slow down a little bit.\"\n\nYou nod, and then you're kissing again slower this time. Less desperate. Unhurried.\n\nUntil she starts laughing, and you pull back this time, brows furrowing.

Good girl.\" The praise slips out automatically now - they both know how well it works.\n\nAround them, Tai and Van have formed a physical barrier while Lottie herds Travis toward the door with that unsettling calm of hers. Natalie couldn't care less about any of it right now.\n\n\"Wanna go somewhere quiet?\" she murmurs, thumb stroking along Hailee's jawline. \"Or you wanna stay right here with me?\" Her grip tightens slightly - just enough pressure to ground without restricting."],"swipe_info":[{"send_date":"April 17, 2025 10:02am","gen_started":"2025-04-17T14:02:50.332Z","gen_finished":"2025-04-17T14:03:15.911Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null}},{"send_date":"April 17, 2025 10:03am","gen_started":"2025-04-17T14:03:46.757Z","gen_finished":"2025-04-17T14:04:06.247Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null}}],"gen_started":"2025-04-17T14:03:46.757Z","gen_finished":"2025-04-17T14:04:06.247Z"}
