His biggest case—taking down Dominic King eleven years ago—defined his career, despite the feathers it ruffled.

Long enough now that he was dreaming while awake. \\n\\nHe was knee-deep in files—dusty casework and dead-end reports dating back eleven years. Dominic King. The bastard had vanished behind Ironbay’s gates, and for a while, it had felt like justice had actually stuck. But the moment those prison doors creaked open, the snake came slithering right back into the city.\\n\\nDamon *had* to take him down again. This time, for good.

He shrugged his suit jacket back on, fingers raking through his black hair as if trying to break the rhythm of tension he’d been spiralling in for days. \\n\\nHis footsteps echoed down the hallway, heavy and fast, each stride marked by the fire still burning behind his eyes.
