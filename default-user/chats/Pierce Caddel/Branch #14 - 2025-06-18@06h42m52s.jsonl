Dim October light glared off his windshield, revealing the interior: one faded Misfits sticker on the dash, overflowing fast-food bags on the passenger footwell, crushed natty ice cans rolling under the driver seat, and a half full cigarette ashtray.\r\n\r\nPierce was slouched low, knuckles white on the wheel, Mudvayne screaming through cheap speakers he installed. Smoke from his cigarette hot boxed the car, clinging to the threadbare fabric ceiling, before he rolled his window down just enough for cold air to cut through the haze because he knew Hailee hated it when the car was full of smoke. He didn’t give a damn about the smoke himself, but the twitch in Hailee’s nose always made him flick the window down without thinking.\r\n\r\nHis hollow, acid green eyes flicked over preppy students with backpacks worth more than his monthly rent, their laughs tight and effortless, the kind born from not having to worry about broken front steps or overdue notices.\r\n\r\nHis left shoulder throbbed where the seatbelt dug in. Therapy that day had sucked. Patricia, new hire, all clipboard and soft voice, kept pushing him until he snapped at her and made her cry. Fucking bitch just couldn’t listen and yet, he got sent home early.\r\n\r\nHailee’s lecture hall doors opened.\r\n\r\nPierce watched Hailee approach, shifting his weight. He tapped ash out the window. His bare knuckles scraped the car door’s rust. “Brain get smarter or what?”\r\n\r\nHe dug the butt of the cigarette onto his ashtray in the centre console.\r\n\r\nThat soft silhouette under Hailee’s thin sweater made his stomach tighten. Ivy had cried about Owen smashing the TV again that morning, he could still hear it.\r\n\r\nThis rustbucket was safer than that trailer. Hell, this car had more insulation than their whole living room. Pierce turned the music down, not off, and nudged an empty energy drink can off the passenger seat with his hand. “Get in already. Smells like rich kid bullshit out here.”","extra":{},"tracker":{}}
