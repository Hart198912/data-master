Belonged next to her.\r\n\r\nAbso-fucking-lutely not. Cami would rather jump off the Golden Gate than be intimate with Amy’s basic ass. But, flirting with Amy was the one way to get what Cami really wanted. Of course, that was Hailee .\r\n\r\nShe could remember the first time she met Hailee . It was at a small get-together amongst mutual friends a couple of months ago, and Amy brought Hailee . She introduced Hailee  to everyone as their partner. Which was very uncool considering Cami had been undressing Hailee  before Amy started flapping her horse-like gums about how amazing and cool Hailee  was. Yeah, duh, Cami knew how amazing they were, and totally out of Amy’s league.\r\n\r\nBut, there was one thing their entire friend group knew about Amy that Hailee  had yet to figure out. Amy was totally into Cami. To be honest, though? A lot of people were. That’s why she had so many subs. Maybe it was because she was good at games or her cute, girly aesthetic, but there was no denying that Cami was hot as fuck. And she knew it too.\r\n\r\nOn cue, she watched Hailee  make their way back from the bathroom, moving through the sushi restaurant and back towards the table. Now it was her chance to make them see what a dumb slut Amy was. Bonus points if she could get Hailee  to dump Amy on the spot.\r\n\r\n“Oh my god, you have to tell me what perfume you’re wearing, babes… It smells soooo good.” Cami giggled, toying with Amy’s dull, mousey brown hair, letting Hailee  watch as Amy blushed and shied her gaze away. Though Amy’s eyes moved, her body didn’t. The body language didn’t lie, Amy loved the attention that Cami was giving her, so much so that she barely noticed that Hailee  had sat across from the two of them.\r\n\r\n“Hey, Hailee ! We totally missed you, right Amy?” She asked coyly, continuing to touch Amy’s arm with her nails. It was an intimate gesture. Something one wouldn’t do with someone with just a friend and Amy was letting it happen.\r\n\r\nCome on, Hailee ... don’t let her let me do this… dump her ass…","extra":{},"swipe_id":0,"swipes":["Ugh… this bitch has her hands all over me…\r\n\r\nCami internally groaned as she pretended to enjoy the way Amy wrapped her arm around her shoulders, squeezing her arm as if she belonged there.

Several men had already attempted to grab the popular Twitch streamer. Perhaps they thought the five-foot-nothing cute, pink-haired girl wouldn’t do anything about it if they tried to grind on her leg, but each attempt was swiftly swatted at.\r\n\r\nIronically, the hazy, dimly-lit nightclub was called ‘Vision’. Ironic ‘cause Cami couldn’t see shit except the people in front of her that she was pushing past.\r\n\r\nUgh… Where is everyone?\r\n\r\nIt was her friend Jackie’s birthday and Jackie was the one that chose this club. Cami insisted that she could get their entire friend group into a better one, like The Garrison down on Valencia Street, but noooo... Vision was where it was at apparently. Some friend of a friend who was a friend owned the club. Granted, the VIP table they had gotten was pretty nice… and the club wasn’t that bad… okay, maybe Cami was being a teensy bit bratty.\r\n\r\nBut could anyone blame her? She was practically fighting off horny guys while trying to find her friends that had scattered like the wind while she went to go get a damn drink.\r\n\r\nThat’s when she heard the wild voice of Jackie break through the loud house music, “Whooo! It’s myyy birthdayyyy!”\r\n\r\nI’m going to fight her for ditching me. Birthday girl or not.\r\n\r\nBefore she could turn towards the direction of said birthday girl, she felt… oh god, is that a dick on my ass??\r\n\r\nSure enough, a guy had taken his opportunity while she was turned around to start grinding on her, full-pitched tent and everything.\r\n\r\n“Ew! Back off!” Cami shouted, trying to pull away, but the guy was too drunk to hear her and not drunk enough to relax his grip on her hips.\r\n\r\n“Relax, baby… w’just havin’ a g’time… yeah?” the drunk slurred together, continuing to dance to a remix of ‘Day ‘N’ Nite’ and grinded his fully masted dick on her.\r\n\r\nAs she reached for her taser that sat snuggly in her little handbag, she felt the guy’s hands fly off her and the guy himself stumble back, falling right onto his ass.\r\n\r\nOh now the floor clears for the guy who’s falling?\r\n\r\nThe thought quickly left her head as she realized why the guy had suddenly stumbled back. {{user}} stood behind her, glaring at the drunk guy while Cami’s eyes flicked between the two. {{user}}... the person who she thought didn’t pay her any mind was defending her? Oh, she’d never been so turned on in her life."],"swipe_info":[],"tracker":{}}
