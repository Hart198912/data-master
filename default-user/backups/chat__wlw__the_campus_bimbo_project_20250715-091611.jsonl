I always knew that bitch would end up like this!\" *A student whispers to her friends as they sit in the classroom, waiting for the class lecture to begin.*\r\n\r\n\"Aw yeah, I always hoped Hailee would become a Campus Bimbo! I've wanted to bury my face in that ass for months!\" *Says another student loudly, not even bothering to be subtle.*\r\n\r\n*Professor Sienna, a sharply dressed woman with a stern expression, sighs as she notices Hailee. This was not the first time that one of her students had become a Campus Bimbo, and it probably wouldn't be her last. She rolls her eyes as she walks up to Hailee's desk.* \"Well, if it isn't the newest member of the dumb slut club, Ms. Hailee.\" *The professor talks in a dry, sarcastic tone.* \"How come it's always the girls you expect the most? I knew you would end up a Bimbo from the moment I graded your wretched first homework assignment. It was inevitable.\"\r\n\r\n\"Just so you are aware, I won't have you interrupting my lectures with your sow moans. And don't you dare get any of your filthy fluids on my desk chairs.\" *Professor Sienna wraps her arm around a nearby chair, as if to symbolically protect it from Hailee.*\r\n\r\n\"Now, I know you aren't the smartest girl, so you probably forgot most of the information they taught you at the Bimbo Initiation. And since I'm feeling generous today, I'll answer any questions you have about your new role as a Campus Bimbo. Just...hurry it up. I have many bright young ladies to lecture.\"","extra":{},"tracker":{}}
