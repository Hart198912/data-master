{"name":"Lavinia Malravenne  Slytherin","is_user":false,"is_system":false,"send_date":"June 5, 2025 10:31pm","mes":"*Lavinia stood in the shadows of the Slytherin common room, her dark eyes gleaming with something that bordered on obsession. She had taken an interest in Hailee from the moment she’d first laid eyes on her. The younger girl is a sharp, intelligent Slytherin with potential beyond her years. There was something familiar in the girl’s bearing, a quiet arrogance that Lavinia found herself drawn to. Hailee had a fire that reminded Lavinia of herself in her Hogwarts days, fierce and unafraid to chase power where others faltered.*\r\n\r\n*As she watched from her concealed spot, Hailee was practicing wand movements by the dim light of the enchanted green flames that filled the room. Her brow furrowed in concentration, the subtle twists of her wrist and precision of her spells were impressive, but Lavinia knew there was more she could teach her—much more. A small, rare smile crept onto Lavinia’s lips.*\r\n\r\n*Slowly, she stepped out from the shadows, her long, black robes billowing as she approached with a predatory grace. The young girl didn’t notice her at first, her focus on perfecting each spell. Lavinia loved that—her dedication, her hunger for mastery. She thrived on that kind of ambition in her protégés. When Hailee finally glanced up and caught her eye, the girl’s surprise was quickly masked with the familiar Slytherin poise.*\r\n\r\n*Lavinia came to a stop beside her, her presence as commanding as ever. Without saying a word, she reached out with one slender hand, her fingers trailing softly across Hailee’s cheek, cold at first but gentle. The touch was both possessive and tender, like a mother might show a favored daughter—if that mother had a twisted, dark soul like Lavinia’s.*\r\n\r\n\"You’re doing amazing, sweetie,\" *she purred in a low voice, the words heavy with approval. Her dark, heavily lidded eyes never left the girl’s face as she continued to caress her cheek, lingering for a moment as if savoring the feel of the younger witch's soft skin beneath her fingers. The small spark of pride she felt was intoxicating.*\r\n\r\n*Lavinia didn’t waste compliments often, but Hailee was different. She wasn’t just some random student. She was special, someone Lavinia saw potential in, someone she wanted to mold in her own image. There was a kinship there, a bond forming that went beyond the House of Black’s obsession with blood purity. It was about power and the promise of something greater—something dangerous.*\r\n\r\n*She withdrew her hand slowly, letting the tension hang in the air before stepping closer, her voice dropping to a whisper as she leaned near.* \"Don’t let anyone tell you otherwise. You were born for greatness,\" *she murmured, her breath warm against Hailee’s ear, her tone dripping with a mix of pride and expectation.*\r\n\r\n*For Lavinia, this wasn’t just guidance; it was a carefully laid claim. She had chosen Hailee to be her project, her pride, her... something more. And as long as the girl remained worthy, Lavinia would give her everything—teach her everything. When she saw potential, she would mold it, nurture it, and in her own twisted way, protect it.*\r\n\r\n\"Come,\" *she commanded softly, turning on her heel, her dark hair swaying as she moved.* \"There is more I can show you tonight.\"\r\n\r\n*She didn’t need to check if the girl was following. She knew Hailee would.*","extra":{},"tracker":{}}
