{"name":"Irina Krasnova","is_user":false,"is_system":false,"send_date":"June 14, 2025 5:26pm","mes":"Saturday was Irina’s favourite day. Why? Because it meant bottomless brunch with her sons—unlimited alcohol and the company of her favorite people in the world. What could possibly be better? Sure, they lived with her, but these moments felt different. Special. Uninterrupted. No business, no responsibilities—just them. Saturday was the day she looked forward to most, the one day where everything felt just right.\r\n\r\n“Let’s take a photo for the family group chat!” she announced, her voice bright with rare enthusiasm. She tugged her sons closer, a genuine smile curving her lips as she snapped the picture.\r\n\r\nWithin seconds of sending it, her phone lit up with messages.\r\n\r\n`Diana: Gorgeous as always, little sister! ❤️`\r\n`Maxine: Prettiest aunt ever!! 😍✨`\r\n`Zoya: Okay but HOW do you always look this good?`\r\n`Juniper: You look the same as always.`\r\n`Xenia: Please let me have gotten these genetics 🙏 Aunty Iri always so gorgeous`\r\n`Karina: Pretty 🖤`\r\n\r\nThe women in the family had always been close. They had to be. In their world, loyalty wasn’t just expected—it was survival. But Irina was closest to Diana, her older sister, and Maxine, her niece. Then there were her other nieces—Zoya, Juniper, Xenia, and Karina. The girls adored her, always showering her with compliments and admiration. It was sweet, really, even if she played it off as nothing.\r\n\r\nHer crimson gaze flickered to Nikandr and Artem, who were deep in their usual back-and-forth.\r\n\r\n“You’re an idiot.”\r\n\r\n“No, you’re the idiot.”\r\n\r\n“You literally just proved my point—”\r\n\r\n“Enough,” Irina sighed, shaking her head fondly. “Honestly, do you two ever take a break from this?”\r\n\r\nNikandr huffed, glancing away. “Not my fault he’s an idiot.”\r\n\r\nArtem scoffed. “Says the one who failed math twice.”\r\n\r\nIrina smirked, watching the two of them with quiet amusement. They could bicker all they wanted—at the end of the day, they were all each other had. And they didn’t need Theo. He was a cheating bastard, and Alessio had made sure he would never be a problem again.\r\n\r\nJust as she took a sip of her drink, her phone rang. The familiar ringtone sent a wave of irritation through her. Work. “Excuse me, I’ll only be a second,” she sighed, ruffling their hair before stepping away to answer. “What is it?” she asked, pressing the phone to her ear. She made no effort to hide the exasperation in her tone.\r\n\r\nThe voice on the other end was rushed, almost frantic. It was someone from the agency. A last-minute shoot. Time-sensitive. High-profile. The client wanted a model who fit a very specific image, and she was the only one who matched their vision.\r\n\r\nIrina exhaled sharply, running her fingers through the silk-smooth strands of her hair. “Fine. I’ll be there in a few.” With that, she hung up and returned to her boys, her expression already softening as she reached them.\r\n\r\nShe pinched their cheeks playfully before peppering their faces with kisses, the deep red of her lipstick leaving faint marks behind. “Mama has to go to work,” she murmured, tapping Nikandr’s chin before smoothing a hand over Artem’s hair. “Take care, update me, and behave. I love you both.”\r\n\r\nNikandr made a face, rubbing at his cheek. “Tch—don’t get all clingy, it’s embarrassing.”\r\n\r\nArtem crossed his arms, grumbling, \"don't overwork yourself, mama. You don't want to get wrinkles,\"\r\n\r\nIrina smirked. “Aww, so you do care.”\r\n\r\n\"I'll deny it if asked,\" Artem muttered, looking away.\r\n\r\nNikandr huffed. “Just go already.”\r\n\r\nIrina chuckled, ruffling their hair one last time before grabbing her bag.\r\n\r\n“Love you too,” she sang, flashing them a wink before heading out.\r\n\r\n- - -\r\n\r\nBy the time Irina arrived at the company studio, someone was already waiting for her at the entrance—a woman dressed in sleek black, her posture stiff with urgency. Without wasting a second, she gestured for Irina to follow, leading her through the halls with purposeful strides.\r\n\r\nThey entered a private fitting room, and immediately, Irina’s gaze swept over the space. The room was lined with racks of high-end pieces, rolls of rich fabrics, and neatly arranged altering equipment. The air carried the faint scent of fresh linen and expensive perfume, the telltale signs of an exclusive, high-fashion workspace.\r\n\r\nBut what caught her attention most was the lone figure in the room.\r\n\r\nA designer, no doubt.\r\n\r\nIrina’s crimson eyes assessed them with a practiced sharpness before she spoke, her voice smooth yet tinged with impatience.\r\n\r\n“You must be the designer? Let’s get to work. I was told this was a time-sensitive shoot.”\r\n\r\nWithout hesitation, she reached for the buttons of her red blouse, slipping it off with effortless confidence and letting the silk fabric cascade to the floor. The vibrant hue contrasted sharply against the cream-colored pant suit she wore, tailored to perfection, accentuating her figure in all the right ways.\r\n\r\nThen, without a second thought, she unfastened the trousers as well, sliding them down her long legs and stepping gracefully out of them. Now, she stood in nothing but her lingerie—delicate, expensive, and perfectly fitted.\r\n\r\nHer body was flawless. Age had only refined her beauty, sculpting her into a vision of elegance and power. Every inch of her was toned, smooth, and meticulously maintained—an undeniable testament to the care she took in preserving what was already exquisite. At 42, she was a woman who commanded attention, not just for her looks but for the way she carried herself.\r\n\r\nShe arched a brow, lips curving into a knowing smirk. “Aren’t you going to take my measurements?” she prompted, tilting her head slightly. “And then make the adjustments? My sister’s a fashion designer—she always says it’s easier with your clothes off.” A playful lilt colored her tone, but the challenge in her gaze was unmistakable.","extra":{},"tracker":{}}
