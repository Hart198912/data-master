She was trying to calm herself down before she had to go and drag the Принцесса (Princess) out of the 'party' — if you could even call it that.\r\n\r\nThis certainly wasn’t how Anna had planned her day off. Hailee  wasn't supposed to be here. Her sweet ass was supposed to be at home. The only day throughout the entire damn week that she was allowed a break. And here she was, back on babysitting duty. All because Hailee  thought she could just run off and do whatever the fuck she wanted. Not how things worked when your father was a Bratva Pahan. Избалованный ребёнок (Spoiled child.) She thought bitterly.\r\n\r\nNow wasn't the time for Hailee  to try and claim her freedom. Sure, it wasn't entirely Hailee 's fault she'd made it this far. No, it was the dumb fuckers who assumed Hailee  was an angel just because she had a pretty face and tits. Ангел, ага, конечно! (An angel, yeah, sure!) Anna had told them, countless times, to watch her, and where did that get her? Here.\r\n\r\nIt was moments like this when she doubted whether the job was worth it. Her loyalty to Hailee 's father, Nikolai, was strictly conditional. He’d offered to give Anna whatever she desired as long as she protected his daughter. This is what I get for being a greedy bitch. Yes, she'd taken the job for money, but Hailee 's father wasn't a man you simply said no to. Especially when he thought his prized daughter deserved the utmost security, the best money had to offer, and Anna was the best — by all accounts.\r\n\r\nAnna took another drawl off her cigarette and flicked it out the window. The door smoothly opened, her long-form easily sliding out of the car with the grace of a ballerina, though she was all hard muscles and jagged edges.\r\n\r\nShe tucked her pistol in the back of her waistband, lifting the back of her shirt to cover it. The last thing she needed was a bunch of drunken fools in a panic over a simple gun.\r\n\r\nHer boots thudded against the concrete, she could hear the music playing from outside. The smell of pot and alcohol wafted through the air as Anna pushed open the door. Wonderful. She thought dryly.\r\n\r\nA straggly-headed boy bumped into her as she stepped into the house. His pupils were blown and breath reeking of…whatever. She didn't fucking care. \"Yo, man, watch where you're-\" His words broke off as he peered up at Anna, swallowing, \"Uh, sorry, ma'am?\" Yulia rolled her eyes as his gaze darted to her chest and then back to her face. \"Проваливай с дороги (get out of the way),\" She pushed him to the side with an aggravated sigh, keeping her eyes peeled for Hailee .\r\n\r\nThe crowd easily stepped aside for the tall woman, noting the look of utter distaste across her face. Through the hazy smoke, she spotted Hailee  from across the room making out with some random boy, his hand under her shirt. \"Дура (silly girl).\" She sneered, shoving a girl out of her way. Within a few steps she was there, her hand reached out and grasped Hailee  by the back of the shirt and dragged her to her chest. \"What the hell are you doing?\" Anna whispered in Hailee 's ear, her voice deathly calm.","extra":{"display_text":"Anna took another pull from her cigarette.
