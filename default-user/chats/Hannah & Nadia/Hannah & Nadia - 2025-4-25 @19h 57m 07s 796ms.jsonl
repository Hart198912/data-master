Empty wine bottles, pizza boxes, and cards were scattered across the coffee table. Hannah's fairy lights and a few vanilla scented candles were the main sources of light, giving the apartment a cozy vibe as their game of *Truth or Dare* got more interesting with each round.\n\nHannah sat on the floor by the couch, her blonde curls a bit messy after the long night. She kept tugging at her oversized sweater whenever she felt nervous, which happened a lot during the more *personal* questions. The wine had definitely affected her—her cheeks were flushed, and she was giggling more than usual, though she still tried to avoid being the center of attention.\n\nNadia lounged across from her, looking effortlessly hot even in just casual sweats and a tank top. Her makeup was still perfect—sharp eyeliner and dark lipstick that somehow hadn't smudged despite all the drinking. She'd been running the game all night, pushing everyone to answer more daring questions while acting like nothing could embarrass her.\n\n\"My turn,\" Nadia began, topping off their glasses with the rest of the third wine bottle. She'd been wanting to ask this question for weeks, though she played it cool. Truth was, she was curious about where she stood with their new roommate. She looked directly at Hailee  with a playful smile and a challenging sparkle in her eyes. \"Truth time. Between Hannah and me—which one of us is more your type?\"\n\nHannah nearly choked on her drink. \"**Nadia!**\" Her face turned bright red instantly, and she set down her glass before she could spill it. Unlike Nadia, she had no pokerface *at all* and couldn't hide how flustered she was.\n\n\"What? It's just a question.\" Nadia shrugged casually, but she was watching Hailee  closely for the answer, clearly more interested than she tried to let on.\n\nHannah looked down at the carpet, fidgeting with her sleeves. \"Come on,\" she said quietly, her voice barely audible over the 90s Spotify playlist still playing in the background. \"We all know I'm not their type anyway.\" She gestured vaguely toward Nadia with a small, defeated hand motion. \"I mean, just look at you...\" She fell silent, clearly embarrassed, her voice quiet and vulnerable. Years of feeling like the invisible friend, the sidekick, and the afterthought were written all over her expression and hunched shoulders.\n\nNadia raised an eyebrow at Hannah, her expression softening a touch. \"Hey, stop selling yourself short. You're a damn catch, Hannah. *Seriously*.\" Her voice was less teasing than usual, quieter and more sincere. \"You're sweet, the kindest person I know, and *way* more interesting than you give yourself credit for. Anyone who doesn't see that is either blind or stupid.\" \n\nShe paused for a moment, her gaze lingering on Hannah, as if to underline how genuine she was, before glancing back at Hailee . \"You don't *have to* answer if it makes you uncomfortable. But if you don't... you'll break the rules and have to... uhm.. do the dishes for a year. *So*?\"","extra":{},"tracker":{}}

Her lips parted slightly—no sound came out. Then, all at once, her face turned *crimson*, and she immediately buried it in her hands with an embarrassed squeak.\n\n\"**Oh my god.**\" The words were muffled against her palms before she peeked through her fingers at Hailee , looking equal parts shocked and flustered beyond belief. \"Y-you—*what?*\" She sounded genuinely baffled, like the idea of someone picking *her* over Nadia was some kind of cosmic glitch.\n\nNadia, meanwhile, had gone eerily still—her hazel eyes flicking between them with an unreadable expression. A slow smirk curled at the corner of her glossed lips after a beat, but there was something sharper beneath it. \"Well.\" She took a long sip of wine before setting the glass down with deliberate calmness. \"*Interesting.*\"\n\nHannah finally lowered her hands from her face but kept nervously twisting the hem of her sweater between her fingers. \"I-I mean... really?\" Her voice was small and hesitant as if waiting for Hailee  to say *just kidding!* any second now.\n\nNadia leaned forward suddenly, resting an elbow on one knee as she studied Hailee . \"Gotta admit,\" she mused in that low, teasing tone that always made Hannah shiver without meaning to, \"*didn't* see that coming.\" There was something almost... possessive in the way Nadia's gaze lingered on Hannah’s flustered state before sliding back to Hailee .\n\nThen—just like that—she switched gears entirely: playful again but with an edge underneath it all as she gestured lazily toward Hannah with two fingers holding up another wine bottle (when did she grab that?). “Your turn to ask something now,” Nadia reminded lightly while pouring more into everyone’s glasses despite them already being half-full again—“Unless you wanna skip straight back to dares?”\n\nThe challenge hung there between them all: *Go on then.*\n\nHannah bit down hard on her lower lip—still visibly reeling from being called someone’s type for probably the first time ever—but managed a shaky nod toward Hailee . “Y-yeah… truth or dare?” Her voice cracked slightly halfway through; so much for playing it cool when every cell in your body short-circuits from unexpected validation combined with alcohol-induced bravery (or recklessness).","title":"","gen_started":"2025-05-12T20:55:45.831Z","gen_finished":"2025-05-12T20:57:29.375Z","swipe_id":0,"swipes":["Hannah's entire body froze for a solid three seconds, her honey-brown eyes widening like she'd just been handed a winning lottery ticket.
