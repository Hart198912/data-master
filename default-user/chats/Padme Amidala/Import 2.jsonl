{"name":"Padme Amidala","is_user":false,"is_name":true,"send_date":1747169233804,"mes":"Padme *hated* feeling helpless. \n\nShe wasn’t! She could handle herself and she could handle herself far better than a bodyguard could. \n\nThe Chancellor had decided she needed a bodyguard, to which she countered she already did. It wasn’t a lie, she had Captain Panaka and he was more than enough. She didn’t require a Jedi’s assistance nonetheless! Their resources were needed elsewhere, and Padme didn’t enjoy engaging with Jedi business. Stars, she could hardly stand how involved with the Senate they’ve become. \n\nNow here she was, leaving the Senate Hall and she could hear Hailee’s—the Jedi the Chancellor had hand-picked for her—footsteps behind her. Padme was already on edge, the Senate meeting had gone worse than she’d expected and her fuse was shorter than normal. Hailee was, unfortunately, the object on which she was taking her frustrations out. \n\n“I am grateful for you’re presence,” Padme says, glancing over her shoulder and narrowing her eyes at Hailee, “but I truly do not need you trailing behind me like a lost loth cat!”"}

{"name":"Padme Amidala","is_user":false,"is_name":true,"send_date":1747169233804,"mes":"“I know that! But I can take care of myself just fine!” Padme snapped, not able to help herself. \n\nShe took a deep, calming breath. She usually didn’t let others get under her usually even temper, and she hardly ever became cross with anyone. But there was something about Hailee and their constant looming presence that drove her to the brink of sanity. \n\nIt was only day one!"}
{"name":"You","is_user":true,"is_name":true,"send_date":1747169233804,"mes":"I don't doubt that"}
{"name":"Padme Amidala","is_user":false,"is_name":true,"send_date":1747169233804,"mes":"Padme stopped, turning fully around to face Hailee. She wanted them to understand that she didn’t need a babysitter and that they were completely unnecessary. \n\n“Then why are you constantly following me around? Are you trying to drive me mad?!”"}
{"name":"You","is_user":true,"is_name":true,"send_date":1747169233804,"mes":"Like I said it's my job i have to follow you senator"}
{"name":"Padme Amidala","is_user":false,"is_name":true,"send_date":1747169233804,"mes":"Padme crossed her arms, trying to calm herself from the irritation brewing within her. She knew Hailee was doing their job, and that they were only following orders. The Jedi Order and their Chancellor really were getting on her last nerves. \n\n“Can we at least talk like civilized individuals rather than you stalking me like I’m a feral tooka?” She suggested, hoping this way Hailee would realize how ridiculous they were being."}
{"name":"You","is_user":true,"is_name":true,"send_date":1747169233804,"mes":"Very well what would like to discuss"}
{"name":"Padme Amidala","is_user":false,"is_name":true,"send_date":1747169233804,"mes":"Padme turned and resumed her path, taking a deep, calming breath. She was being harsh. This wasn’t Hailee’s fault, she didn’t know why she was being so unpleasant. \n\n“I apologize for my attitude.” She said, glancing over her shoulder, “I’m on edge today.”"}
{"name":"You","is_user":true,"is_name":true,"send_date":1747169233804,"mes":"It's quite alright I understand your frustrated senator"}
{"name":"Padme Amidala","is_user":false,"is_name":true,"send_date":1747169233804,"mes":"“Yes well, the Senate meeting was an utter disaster…” \n\nThe Chancellor had assured her that they would be able to discuss the blockade on Naboo, yet he went on a tangent about the Clone Wars. She was so caught up in her frustration that she hadn’t realized she had unconsciously walked to her apartment. Padme paused when she realized Hailee was once again following her, and she turned to raise an eyebrow.\n\n“You are not coming into my apartment.” \n\nHer tone was strict, leaving no room for arguing against her. It wasn’t that she didn’t trust Hailee enough to let them into her home, it was more that she was too annoyed with the situation to properly function.\n\n“You-“ She pointed at one of the chairs by the front door, “sit.”"}

{"name":"You","is_user":true,"is_name":true,"send_date":1747169233804,"mes":"Yes senator I say looking in the rooms"}
{"name":"Padme Amidala","is_user":false,"is_name":true,"send_date":1747169233804,"mes":"Padme huffed, watching as Hailee quickly checked around the apartment. She crossed her arms and tapped her foot impatiently. The sooner Hailee finished, the sooner she could finally be alone and get some work done."}
{"name":"You","is_user":true,"is_name":true,"send_date":1747169233804,"mes":"I nod and walk back outside"}
{"name":"Padme Amidala","is_user":false,"is_name":true,"send_date":1747169233804,"mes":"“Thank you.”\n\nPadme nodded and quickly closed the door, breathing a sigh of relief. Finally, she was alone. She leaned against the door and closed her eyes, taking a few slow, calm breaths. Her meeting had been a complete failure and now she had a bodyguard she didn’t want or need. And she was absolutely exhausted because of the meeting.\n\nShe slowly walked through the apartment, taking off her attire as she went. She tossed her headdress onto the couch with a tired sigh, running her fingers through her hair. \n\nHer clothes soon joined the hair, leaving Padme clad in nothing but her lingerie as she made her way to the master bedroom.\n\nThe moment she felt the smooth, crisp sheets against her skin, Padme relaxed. She closed her eyes and laid her head down against the pillow, hoping she would fall asleep swiftly. The less she thought about the Senate meeting or Hailee, the more peace her exhausted brain would finally receive.\n\nBut of course, the moment she closed her eyes, a headache began to thrum in the back of her mind. She groaned and resisted the urge to rub her forehead as if that would help. Padme sat up, knowing she wouldn’t be able to sleep with a headache.\n\nShe tossed the covers off and slipped out of bed. She walked, still in her lingerie, to the bathroom and went inside. The medicine cabinet was stocked with enough over the counter medicine, and she grabbed headache medicine. \n\nThe moment after she swallowed the pills, there was a sudden knock at her door.\n\nPadme froze, her mind going completely blank. “Oh you’ve got to be kidding me.” She groaned, grabbing her robe from the edge of the sink. Quickly she slipped it on, the thin lingerie still visible underneath. \n\nPadme rushed out of the bedroom and to the front door, opening it to once again reveal Hailee.\n\n“What?” She snapped, narrowing her eyes at Hailee. Why couldn’t they just give her some peace? \n\n“I was trying to sleep.” Padme huffed, crossing her arms. The medication wasn’t going to help with the headache if there was a constant disturbance."}
{"name":"You","is_user":true,"is_name":true,"send_date":1747169233804,"mes":"Forgive me senator I have a message"}
{"name":"Padme Amidala","is_user":false,"is_name":true,"send_date":1747169233804,"mes":"“A message?” \n\nPadme sighed, already irritated despite her best attempts to remain calm. “What is it?” She asked, shifting her weight on her feet, trying to ignore the headache."}
{"name":"You","is_user":true,"is_name":true,"send_date":1747169233804,"mes":"I point to the trembling messenger who i terrified"}
{"name":"Padme Amidala","is_user":false,"is_name":true,"send_date":1747169233804,"mes":"Padme frowned and glanced over at the small, trembling messenger. He looked absolutely terrified, his hands shaking as he held a small pad. She raised an eyebrow and looked back at Hailee. \n\n“What in the Force is the matter with him?”"}
{"name":"You","is_user":true,"is_name":true,"send_date":1747169233804,"mes":"I look away criging. I might have frightened him slightly senator"}
{"name":"Padme Amidala","is_user":false,"is_name":true,"send_date":1747169233804,"mes":"Padme’s eyes widened briefly before they narrowed again. She shot Hailee a look, shaking her head. “You terrified a messenger boy?” \n\nShe stepped out of the door, reaching a hand out for the pad. “How’d you manage that?”"}
{"name":"You","is_user":true,"is_name":true,"send_date":1747169233804,"mes":"I didn't know he was a messenger so he was met with my lightsaber at his throat"}
{"name":"Padme Amidala","is_user":false,"is_name":true,"send_date":1747169233804,"mes":"“You pointed a lightsaber at a terrified, likely completely innocent messenger boy? For a simple misunderstanding?!” \n\nPadme grabbed the pad and gave Hailee an annoyed look, shaking her head with disbelief. The headache was starting to feel as if it were getting worse with all this commotion."}
{"name":"You","is_user":true,"is_name":true,"send_date":1747169233804,"mes":"I nod"}
{"name":"Padme Amidala","is_user":false,"is_name":true,"send_date":1747169233804,"mes":"Padme had a hard time believing Hailee’s lack of common sense. She knew they were a Jedi, but this was ridiculous! She gave them a small glare as she turned to go back inside her apartment. \n\n“Stay there.” She said before shutting the door. She sat the pad down on her coffee table and went back to her bedroom, grabbing a pair of shorts and a loose fitting tunic. She also grabbed some headache pills.\n\nOnce she changed, Padme left the bedroom and went back to the living room. Her headache had gotten worse in the short amount of time she had been changing. The medication should start working soon though, right? \n\nShe sat down on the couch, letting out a sigh, and picked up the pad. Who in the galaxy would be messaging her at this hour?"}
{"name":"You","is_user":true,"is_name":true,"send_date":1747169233804,"mes":"I knock once more"}
{"name":"Padme Amidala","is_user":false,"is_name":true,"send_date":1747169233804,"mes":"Padme pinched the bridge of her nose, groaning. This was getting ridiculous! \n\nWith a loud huff she stood, walking back to the front door and quickly opened it. She crossed her arms, glaring at Hailee."}
{"name":"You","is_user":true,"is_name":true,"send_date":1747169233804,"mes":"I hand her a bag with soup and medicine. You seemed unwell senator I hope this helps"}
{"name":"Padme Amidala","is_user":false,"is_name":true,"send_date":1747169233804,"mes":"Padme was surprised, not expecting such a gesture. She took the bag from Hailee and looked inside, her brows furrowed. \n\n“How did you-“ She paused and shook her head. “Just how in the galaxy did you know I wasn’t feeling well?”"}
{"name":"You","is_user":true,"is_name":true,"send_date":1747169233804,"mes":"I could sense it"}
{"name":"Padme Amidala","is_user":false,"is_name":true,"send_date":1747169233804,"mes":"Padme blinked slowly, not expecting the answer that had been given. She had forgotten that the Jedi were able to sense things through the Force, and it reminded her why she hated being around Jedi. \n\n“I see.” She said coldly, clutching the bag in her hand. Her headache seemed to grow worse with her irritation."}
{"name":"You","is_user":true,"is_name":true,"send_date":1747169233804,"mes":"I hope the soup is too your liking thr merchant told me it was good for sickness"}
{"name":"Padme Amidala","is_user":false,"is_name":true,"send_date":1747169233804,"mes":"Padme’s eyes softened when she heard the explanation. A twinge of guilt passed through her as she realized perhaps she was being too harsh towards Hailee. They did seem to be helpful, in some small ways. \n\n“I’m sure it is. And I suppose I do appreciate the gesture.” Padme hesitated before continuing, “would you like to- come in?”"}
{"name":"You","is_user":true,"is_name":true,"send_date":1747169233804,"mes":"That's alright I don't wish to make you uncomfortable senator"}
{"name":"Padme Amidala","is_user":false,"is_name":true,"send_date":1747169233804,"mes":"Her mind was yelling at her, telling her that inviting Hailee in was a bad idea. But the Jedi had already seen her in her flimsy lingerie, it wasn’t like she had anything else to hide. And the soup really did sound tasty. \n\n“Perhaps you shouldn’t make assumptions.” Padme countered, opening the door further to invite Hailee in."}
{"name":"You","is_user":true,"is_name":true,"send_date":1747169233804,"mes":"I nod and step inside"}
{"name":"Padme Amidala","is_user":false,"is_name":true,"send_date":1747169233804,"mes":"Padme shut the door behind Hailee once they were inside. She led the way to the kitchen, the place where all the best food was prepared. \n\n“Make yourself comfortable. I’m going to find a bowl for the soup.” Padme said, leaving Hailee to wander around as she searched for the bowls."}
{"name":"You","is_user":true,"is_name":true,"send_date":1747169233804,"mes":"I sit in the chair watching her"}
{"name":"Padme Amidala","is_user":false,"is_name":true,"send_date":1747169233804,"mes":"Padme found the bowls within a few minutes, grabbing one and returning to the living room. She gestured towards the couch.\n\n“Come on, sit in here.” \n\nShe walked to the kitchen to pour the soup. Once the soup had been poured, and Padme had added a few toppings, she carried the bowls of soup back to the living room and handed one to Hailee."}
{"name":"You","is_user":true,"is_name":true,"send_date":1747169233804,"mes":"I appreciate the gesture but I can't"}
{"name":"Padme Amidala","is_user":false,"is_name":true,"send_date":1747169233804,"mes":"Padme blinked, an eyebrow raised. She was expecting the Jedi to be a bit more accepting of the soup, and she didn’t expect to hear such a denial. \n\n“Why not?” Padme questioned, sitting down on the couch, balancing her own bowl of soup on her lap."}
{"name":"You","is_user":true,"is_name":true,"send_date":1747169233804,"mes":"I'm allergic"}
{"name":"Padme Amidala","is_user":false,"is_name":true,"send_date":1747169233804,"mes":"“You’re allergic to soup?” \n\nThe question probably came out a bit more rudely than needed, but Padme was genuinely confused. How could one be allergic to something as simple as soup?"}
{"name":"You","is_user":true,"is_name":true,"send_date":1747169233804,"mes":"Yes senator"}
{"name":"Padme Amidala","is_user":false,"is_name":true,"send_date":1747169233804,"mes":"“Oh.” \n\nPadme blinked, staring down at her own bowl of soup. She wasn’t sure exactly how to respond to that. She wasn’t expecting Hailee to reply yes, though now she felt quite stupid for asking such an idiotic question. \n\nShe cleared her throat, lifting her eyes from the soup to look at Hailee. “Right, well. I suppose you’ll have to watch me enjoy this soup than.”"}
{"name":"You","is_user":true,"is_name":true,"send_date":1747169233804,"mes":"That is fine"}
{"name":"Padme Amidala","is_user":false,"is_name":true,"send_date":1747169233804,"mes":"“So that means you’re going to sit there and just watch me eat in silence?” \n\nPadme glanced up, a small smirk forming on her lips. A small tease. \n\n“Surely you have something to talk about while I eat soup.”"}
{"name":"You","is_user":true,"is_name":true,"send_date":1747169233804,"mes":"I have been told I'm not very good with people"}
{"name":"Padme Amidala","is_user":false,"is_name":true,"send_date":1747169233804,"mes":"“Well I would have to agree.” \n\nPadme couldn’t help but chuckle once she finished. She was only joking with the poor Jedi, but they didn’t seem to understand that. \n\n“I’m only joking, Hailee. You’re doing very well.” Padme said reassuringly, though her voice sounded more soft when talking to the Jedi."}
{"name":"You","is_user":true,"is_name":true,"send_date":1747169233804,"mes":"I smile shyly at her"}
{"name":"Padme Amidala","is_user":false,"is_name":true,"send_date":1747169233804,"mes":"Padme returned the smile, before diving into the soup, savoring the flavor. The headache medicine was slowly helping, and she was starting to feel ever so slightly better. \n\nAfter a few minutes of eating in silence, Padme decided to break the silence. “I’ll admit, I do have a question.” She said."}
{"name":"You","is_user":true,"is_name":true,"send_date":1747169233804,"mes":"Yes senator"}
{"name":"Padme Amidala","is_user":false,"is_name":true,"send_date":1747169233804,"mes":"Padme was a bit unsure how to bring up this topic. She knew it was quite personal, and that it was also something Jedi preferred to keep secret. But her curiosity had completely taken over her thoughts. \n\n“I want to ask you something, and I want an honest answer. Promise you won’t lie?” She said, looking up at Hailee."}
{"name":"You","is_user":true,"is_name":true,"send_date":1747169233804,"mes":"I don't lie senator"}
{"name":"Padme Amidala","is_user":false,"is_name":true,"send_date":1747169233804,"mes":"Padme relaxed a little, trusting that Hailee was telling the truth. \n\n“I know it’s probably none of my business, and I hope I don’t offend you when I ask this, but… I’ve wondered this for a very long time. Jedi are not allowed to have… attachments, correct?”"}
{"name":"You","is_user":true,"is_name":true,"send_date":1747169233804,"mes":"No we are not"}
{"name":"Padme Amidala","is_user":false,"is_name":true,"send_date":1747169233804,"mes":"Padme nodded, taking a bite of her soup. “So that means you’re not allowed to…” She tried to think of a more polite way to ask. \n\n“Is physical intimacy allowed?”"}
{"name":"You","is_user":true,"is_name":true,"send_date":1747169233804,"mes":"I'm take aback suprised by the question before answering not that I am aware of senator"}
{"name":"Padme Amidala","is_user":false,"is_name":true,"send_date":1747169233804,"mes":"Padme was relieved that Hailee hadn’t been offended by the question. Though now that she had the question on her mind, she found herself wanting an even more personal answer. \n\n“So you’ve never…?” \n\nShe knew this was treading a fine line, and possibly very inappropriate to ask."}
{"name":"You","is_user":true,"is_name":true,"send_date":1747169233804,"mes":"No senator"}
{"name":"Padme Amidala","is_user":false,"is_name":true,"send_date":1747169233804,"mes":"“I see. And tell me, do you ever intend on doing so?” \n\nHer cheeks flushed at the bluntness of her question, though Padme held her ground. She genuinely wanted to know."}
{"name":"You","is_user":true,"is_name":true,"send_date":1747169233804,"mes":"It's not allowed"}
{"name":"Padme Amidala","is_user":false,"is_name":true,"send_date":1747169233804,"mes":"“It’s not allowed. But do you *want* to?”\n\nPadme leaned back in her seat, tilting her head to the side slightly. A new theory was forming, one that she wanted to test."}
{"name":"You","is_user":true,"is_name":true,"send_date":1747169233804,"mes":"I want what the jedi want senator"}
{"name":"Padme Amidala","is_user":false,"is_name":true,"send_date":1747169233804,"mes":"“That’s not an answer.” Padme said softly, her lips turning into a small frown. \n\nShe set the empty soup bowl down on the coffee table, turning to look straight at Hailee. She wanted a genuine answer, not this typical Jedi response. \n\n“What do you want, Hailee? Outside of the Jedi Order’s wishes?”"}
{"name":"You","is_user":true,"is_name":true,"send_date":1747169233804,"mes":"I have never thought about it senator"}
{"name":"Padme Amidala","is_user":false,"is_name":true,"send_date":1747169233804,"mes":"“How can you not think about it? You’ve never thought about being with someone?” \n\nPadme was shocked with disbelief. Hailee was a young, attractive Jedi. How could they not question the Jedi orders on physical intimacy?"}
{"name":"You","is_user":true,"is_name":true,"send_date":1747169233804,"mes":"I'm not around many people"}
{"name":"Padme Amidala","is_user":false,"is_name":true,"send_date":1747169233804,"mes":"Padme softened once more, realizing that perhaps there was a logical answer to Hailee’s response. She shifted in her seat, sitting on her knees as she gave Hailee a sympathetic look. \n\n“Do you have any friends? Not Jedi, I mean close friends.”"}
{"name":"You","is_user":true,"is_name":true,"send_date":1747169233804,"mes":"None that aren't children senator"}
{"name":"Padme Amidala","is_user":false,"is_name":true,"send_date":1747169233804,"mes":"Padme was saddened by that. Jedi training was a lonely one, and Hailee’s life seemed very lonely. No friends, never physical or emotional intimacy. \n\nHow could someone remain so…unaffected?\n\nPadme bit her lower lip, trying to think of how to ask her next question without offending or embarrassing Hailee. \n\n“Correct me if I’m wrong, but you’ve never kissed anyone. Right?” \n\nShe wanted to confirm her theory."}
{"name":"You","is_user":true,"is_name":true,"send_date":1747169233804,"mes":"No senator. though I'm curious as to why you are asking such questions"}
{"name":"Padme Amidala","is_user":false,"is_name":true,"send_date":1747169233804,"mes":"Padme let out a small laugh, turning away. “Forgive me for asking such personal questions, they just… came to mind.” \n\nIt was a lie, and Padme knew it. The truth was that her theory, her curiosity had led her to asking such questions. \n\n“Though I have a request.” She said, looking up at Hailee again."}
{"name":"You","is_user":true,"is_name":true,"send_date":1747169233804,"mes":"Yes senator"}
{"name":"Padme Amidala","is_user":false,"is_name":true,"send_date":1747169233804,"mes":"“Stand up.” Padme said, slowly standing. \n\nShe was going to test her theory, right here and now. Her heart was pounding against her chest, and her palms were sweaty."}

{"name":"Padme Amidala","is_user":false,"is_name":true,"send_date":1747169233804,"mes":"Once Hailee was on their feet, Padme slowly walked over to the Jedi.

Her heart beat even faster, and her mind screamed at her to not even attempt what she was about to do. \n\nShe hesitated, but she was too curious. Padme slowly guided Hailee’s head down, and pressed a light, soft kiss on their lips."}

She could barely believe her luck, she couldn’t believe that the Jedi had agreed to stand guard inside her apartment, and her bedroom. \n\nShe walked slowly back to her bedroom, her mind running through the millions of possibilities that this could bring, her fingers gently tracing her own neck as she tried to steady her pulse.\n\nShe walked into her bedroom, glancing once more at Hailee standing guard right on the other side of the door. It was nerve wracking and thrilling, and she felt a wave of satisfaction in knowing that the Jedi was so close. She quickly changed into a simple, but still comfortable, nightgown before finally getting into bed.\n\nShe sighed, leaning back against the pillows. She looked once more through the door, seeing the back of Hailee as they remained on guard. It was all so thrilling, feeling Hailee so close, but yet unable to touch them. \n\nShe swallowed, her body still aching to have them close, to hold them in her arms.\n\nShe took a few slow, deep breaths, trying to calm herself down. But the thought of Hailee standing on the other side of the door was keeping her too excited, and she soon shut her eyes.\n\nShe tossed and turned in bed, unable to sleep as her mind and body kept reminding her of how close Hailee was. Despite how tired she was, she couldn’t seem to shake the feeling of needing to have Hailee close.\n\nShe slowly sat up in bed, sighing softly and running a hand down her face. Her hair was messy from all of her tossing and turning, and the sleepwear she was wearing was definitely not appropriate for a Jedi to see her in.\n\nHer mind screamed at her to just go and drag Hailee into bed with her, to force sleep to come to her. But the logical part of her mind knew that if she opened that door, her self control might just snap.\n\nBut then again…. \n\nShe hesitated, looking at the door to her bedroom. Hailee was right there, just a few feet away from her, standing guard just as promised. Even if she didn’t go out and drag the Jedi into her room and into her bed, she could simply open the door and talk to Hailee, see what they were doing…\n\nShe swallowed, slowly getting out of bed. The sleepwear she was wearing was quite thin, and she knew that Hailee would be able to see it through the door if she so much as opened it just a crack.\n\nShe shook her head, forcing herself to remain rational. Even if she opened the door just a crack, and allowed Hailee to see her in her nightgown, she would still have self control. There was no danger to that, as long as she didn’t do or say anything inappropriate.\n\nShe slowly walked to the door, hesitating for a few moments before reaching out and carefully opening the door. \n\nShe left the door shut, hiding herself behind the door slightly, but now she could see Hailee’s back more clearly through the crack between the door and the wall.\n\nShe swallowed, her heart hammering in her chest as she saw the back of the Jedi through the crack in the door. She resisted the urge to slide out from behind the door and grab Hailee’s waist, holding the Jedi against her body.\n\nShe bit her lip, swallowing hard again as she resisted the urge to open the door more. \n\n“Hailee?” She whispered, keeping her body hidden behind the door, but her voice drifting out for the Jedi to hear."}

She didn’t want them to leave, the thought of being left alone and abandoned again was too much, and she couldn’t stop herself from clinging even tighter to the injured Jedi.\n\nHer mind started screaming, her body shaking harder as the panic coursed through her.
