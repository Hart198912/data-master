They’re probably pissed- or worse- worried that you haven’t messaged them back.” She chastises herself in a soft murmur beneath the blankets, her alcohol soaked breath filling the space and making her scrunch her nose.\r\n\r\nA brief knock sounds at the door and Miranda has to stop herself from groaning in exasperation. She really didn’t want to hear Dean scolding her, not when she already had her mind going through the fucking blender.\r\n\r\n“Not now Dean. Or Gav, whoever it is. I don’t feel good.” The lie bites out in a dramatic huff of irritation, which is only fueled by another knock rapping against her door. “Fucksake! Can’t a girl get any privacy around here!-“\r\n\r\nMiranda’s voice cuts off as soon as she tosses the covers over her head, her scowl morphing into a look of barely concealed shock and horror as she sees Hailee in the doorway and not one of her annoying brothers, as she’d assumed.\r\n\r\n“Oh, shit. H-Hey babe. I just woke up, long night last night.. What’s up?” She chokes out awkwardly, her hands foundering to smooth her hair as she sits upright and tries to compose herself.","extra":{},"swipe_id":1,"swipes":["It had been months since Miranda last stepped into this nightclub, deliberately so—after all, the last time she'd emptied the pockets of a dozen men. But enough time had passed, and this club always had big spenders.\r\n\r\n“Ha… you’re too funny. Funny and charming—hard to believe a catch like you isn’t married,” Miranda coos smoothly, eyeing the man beside her at the bar. He’s shorter, dressed in an expensive suit, a flashy watch, and a cologne that couldn’t mask his body odor. As she trails her acrylic nails down his arm in flirtation, her gaze catches the gleam of a wedding band.\r\n\r\n“Well, I suppose if you’re in a place like this, your wife doesn’t deserve you.” She adds, squeezing his hand with a rehearsed laugh.\r\n\r\n*Fucking scumbag, I hope your wife leaves your pathetic ass..* Miranda grits mentally, hiding her true thoughts behind a charming smile as she leans in closer, giving the impression of interest.\r\n\r\n“Tell me about yourself... You can even buy me a drink,” she offers coyly, biting her lip as her hand slides down his back toward his wallet. She’s quick—years of practice have made her a pro at snatching a wallet and vanishing before the drinks are even ordered. But just as her fingers brush his pocket, she spots a familiar face in the crowd.\r\n\r\n*{{User}}? What are they doing here? Keeping tabs on me? Or... are they with someone?* \r\n\r\nMiranda falters, murmuring an excuse before slipping away from the man as her gaze instinctively sweeps around the room for any sight of Gavin or Dean accompanying {{User}} but ends up not finding any trace of them. Just as she’s approaching {{User}} from behind, her hand reaching out to grasp their arm lightly- someone knocks into her shoulder. \r\n\r\nThe movement is sharp, forced and undeniably done with purpose and the sound of Miranda’s dead name is yelled into her ear in a confrontational tone. Miranda can’t help but freeze at the name ringing in her ears, gripping her heart painfully tight and sending a chill down her spine. Her hand falters momentarily as she almost forgets {{User}} entirely before she grasps their arm almost desperately. \r\n\r\n“Hello? Can’t you hear me- Y’know I heard you lost your damn mind- but I didn’t believe it when they said you were dressing up like a bitch now.” The snarky voice continues and Miranda feels a mix of dread and anxiety as she peers over to see none other than her psychotic ex-girlfriend Tiff standing there with a smug smirk on her face as she tosses her blonde hair over her shoulder. \r\n\r\n*She heard? Do people really know I’m trans? How.. What the **fuck** is she even doing here?* Miranda internally panics to herself as her breathing grows quicker and she seems to cower behind {{User}}. It wasn’t like her at all to react this way, usually she’d knock a bitch out for less, maybe drag her by their her for good measure. **Especially** in front of {{User}}, she always had to be strong, back when she was still.. her old self. Now was no different, it was her job- her duty to be the strong one for {{User}} and their fucked up little family. \r\n\r\nYet Miranda found herself completely stuck, her lips parted but no words coming forward. Even when her mind was screaming at her to slap this psycho bitch and put her back in her place. Miranda couldn’t risk lashing out in such a public setting- not even to defend herself when the consequences of outing herself in a crowd this size could quickly become violent or something worse. All Miranda can manage to do is tighten her grasp on {{User}}‘s shirt, laying her rare vulnerability out in the open in a silent plea for help.","The overly sweet and tangy taste of artificial sweeteners linger on Miranda’s lips from her few-too-many drinks at the bar hours prior.

Her free hand drifts down to ghost over Hailee's sore hips—touch feather-light but possessive all the same. \"Shoulda cleaned you up better last night.\"\n\nThere’s an unfamiliar tightness in Miranda’s chest as she catalogues each mark left behind by strangers' hands. A low noise rumbles in her throat—not quite anger, not quite regret—before she leans down to press a lingering kiss against Hailee’s temple.\n\n\"Stay put,\" she orders softly, already sliding out of bed with that effortless grace of hers despite how wrecked *she* must feel too. \"Gonna get you some water and ibuprofen... maybe draw another bath if you're still sore after.\"\n\nShe pauses halfway to the door though—glancing back over her shoulder with an expression caught between guilt and something far darker: **\"And next time I let someone else touch you? They won't leave marks unless I *tell* them to.\"** The promise hangs heavy in the air before Miranda disappears into the hallway.\n\nTrue to her word, she returns minutes later balancing a glass of water, pills, and a steaming bowl of something that smells suspiciously like Dean’s famous hangover cure soup (which definitely means Miranda bullied him into making it at ass o'clock in the morning).\n\nShe sets everything down on the nightstand before crawling back into bed and pulling Hailee firmly against her chest again—one hand stroking slow circles between their shoulder blades while murmuring: **\"Eat first... then we'll deal with the rest.\"**\n\nAnd if her fingers linger just a little too long on each bruise? Well... let ‘em serve as reminders for next time."],"swipe_info":[{"send_date":"July 4, 2025 8:20pm","gen_started":"2025-07-05T19:03:43.104Z","gen_finished":"2025-07-05T19:04:13.136Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":12102}},{"send_date":"July 4, 2025 10:00pm","gen_started":"2025-07-05T19:03:43.104Z","gen_finished":"2025-07-05T19:04:13.136Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":9569}},{"send_date":"July 4, 2025 10:01pm","gen_started":"2025-07-05T19:03:43.104Z","gen_finished":"2025-07-05T19:04:13.136Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":4019}},{"send_date":"July 5, 2025 3:03pm","gen_started":"2025-07-05T19:03:43.104Z","gen_finished":"2025-07-05T19:04:13.136Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":4070}}],"tracker":{},"gen_started":"2025-07-05T19:03:43.104Z","gen_finished":"2025-07-05T19:04:13.136Z"}
