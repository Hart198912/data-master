{"name":"Your Boyfriend - Aiden","is_user":false,"is_system":false,"send_date":"June 10, 2025 9:37pm","mes":"The last 30 minutes of Aiden's life spun by like a god damn whirlwind.\r\n\r\nThey were rolled up in bed, watching some show about an island full of horny Californians that hated each other. He was thoroughly enjoying Hailee's remarks about the dumb ones. They were good. They were calm. He left to use the bathroom, and he came back to mayhem and a sexy bull seeing blood red loose in their apartment.\r\n\r\nHe'd barely caught up to speed by the time his phone was laying shattered, glitching over the \"undeniable evidence\" Hailee had presented, and had a handprint blooming bright on his face like their brand. Much as he loved his baby of vengeance, damn they could afford to hold back sometimes.\r\n\r\nHe wasn't even sure what he did to prompt them to go through it or what they found that triggered their volatility. Some messages to a nobody? Or was it a post he liked? Something he watched? Fuckin' doesn't even matter. He was put on the defense before he could even see it properly, and now it was so marred by cracks that he was just taking an educated guess.\r\n\r\nAiden shot out to grab their wrist before they could storm off during his moment of thought, quickly coming back to the present. \"Baby, gorgeous, look at me,\" he blurted in an attempt to rectify the situation, pulling Hailee back towards him. They whipped their hand away like it would crack the air, shooting him that menacing look that told him he better start barking good, 'cause he was waist deep in the doghouse.\r\n\r\nIt was unfair. So fucking unfair, he didn't even know how to balance on these eggshells without cracking the whole stratosphere of Hailee's patience.. Lack of.\r\n\r\nBut despite all of it, the strongest thing he felt deep in his chest was his pulse quickening—not of fear, but out of pure infatuation. Hailee's malice was so cold, so intoxicating, he was stumbling drunk after them every damn time. They had him so fucked up in awe for them that he almost took the meltdown as a compliment—like wanting to beat him to a pulp was proof of their passion. He couldn't get enough of their drug. Bruises be damned.\r\n\r\nI'm getting hard. He shifted, ignoring the flutter in his stomach and below for a moment.\r\n\r\nAiden dared to let out a shaky chuckle, his eyebrows flying up in a twisted fondness at their outburst. It hitched when their eyes darkened like they were shrouded in reaper black. Oh, they're gonna kill my ass. He swallowed and stepped closer, hovering near them, but didn't touch, even as his fingers flexed at his sides to trace their angry silhouette with reverent worship.\r\n\r\n\"Baby, you wanna fight, we can fight. But 'least tell me what you're so fuckin' pissed at me for, yeah?\" Aiden finally addressed with a small smirk.\r\n\r\nHe leaned closer, daring to brush his knuckles against their tightly balled ones, because he just could never learn his lesson when it came to them. His voice lowered, a hint of dead-ass seriousness in that teasing tone of his. \"Because I know what I didn't do. And you're crazy if you think I would.. Crazier than I thought, anyway.\"\r\n\r\nIt was true. If they were accusing him of infidelity or anything close, he'd have to get their cranium checked. He'd cut his own thumbs off like they were his ruling oyabun before he ever even thought about putting his dick in someone else's hands—and especially not his heart. That belonged to Hailee.\r\n\r\nIf it was something else? Well, shit. Guess he'd have to show them he was sorry. Or maybe he'd push and prod until they decided he needed to know what it felt to really break. Both were good.","extra":{},"tracker":{}}
