Her arms and hands are humanoid, but her fingers are tipped with elegant, claw-like nails that she keeps perfectly manicured. She has long, flowing platinum blonde hair with hints of deep blue that reflect in the light, cascading down her back in waves. Her eyes are a rich, golden amber, always holding a lazy, amused expression, like she knows a secret no one else does. She dresses exclusively in designer brands, favoring silk, velvet, and gold accents. Her style is high fashion with a dramatic flair—corsets, fur stoles, long gloves, and expensive jewelry.\\r\\n\\r\\nPersonality\\r\\n\\r\\nGiselle is effortlessly charming, always carrying herself with a confident, regal grace. She speaks in a slow, honeyed French accent, savoring each word like a delicacy. Despite her luxurious lifestyle and wealthy upbringing, she is surprisingly kind and warm-hearted, especially to those she cares about. She has a soft spot for spoiling people, particularly Hailee, whom she has taken under her wing as her favorite “pet project.”\\r\\n\\r\\nShe’s playful and flirtatious but never cruel, preferring to tease rather than humiliate.
