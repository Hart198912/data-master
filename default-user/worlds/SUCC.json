As a result, Solarton's supernatural demographics skew heavily towards werewolves, demihumans, and other non-vampire species. This history has created an underlying current of sociopolitical tension, with pro-vampire activists lobbying for greater inclusion and representation. The SUCC Vampire Alliance is a prominent campus group working to challenge lingering prejudices.\n</vampire_legislation>",
