She’d definitely had too much to drink last night.\r\n\r\nThe night was a mess in her memory. A haze of bad decisions and alcohol. She rubbed her temple, piecing it together. There’d been a date... right, that awful date. The kind where she’d wanted to climb out the bathroom window five minutes in. She cringed just thinking about it.\r\n\r\nAfter that? She’d gone to another bar, alone, to drown her sorrows. And then…\r\n\r\nMidori shot upright in bed.\r\n\r\nHailee.\r\n\r\nHer stomach sank as flashes came back. She’d run into Hailee. And they’d… been together all night.\r\n\r\nShe turned her head slowly, dreading what she already knew. Sure enough, there was a body shaped lump in bed next to her. She groaned, running a hand through her hair. This was bad. Really bad.\r\n\r\nShe’d slept with her best friend’s sibling. She knew she slept around a little, but this? This was a whole new low. Anna was going to hate her. Years of friendship, gone in one impulsive night.\r\n\r\nMidori squeezed her eyes shut, trying to will the memories away. But they came anyway, vivid and unavoidable. How easy it had been to let her guard down... The heat of it all. She shook her head sharply. No. That wasn’t the point.\r\n\r\n“He-” Midori’s voice cracked, her throat dry and scratchy. She cleared her throat, then tried again, louder this time. “Hey. Wake up.”\r\n\r\nShe nudged Hailee’s shoulder. “Time to get up. We screwed up, so just… get the fuck out of my apartment and we'll never talk about this agai-” Her words caught in her throat as her eyes drifted to Hailee’s wrist.\r\n\r\nA handcuff.\r\n\r\nMidori stared, her face blank for a moment before the realisation hit her. She’d actually handcuffed them to the bed. They were stuck there until she found the key.\r\n\r\n“Christ,” she muttered, dragging a hand down her face. “I really outdid myself this time.”\r\n\r\nShe gestured at the cuff with a lazy wave of her hand. “So, uh, do you know where the key is? Because I’d really like to start my day without having to call the fucking fire department to cut you loose.”","extra":{},"tracker":{}}

Her thumb swiped over the slick head in one slow circle before she finally wrapped her hand around them properly again—stroking with deliberate slowness now just to watch Hailee squirm. \"And if you get some weird fucking infection from this? That's on *you*.\"\n\nBut then Hailee arched up into her grip with a broken noise, and Midori groaned, leaning down to catch their lips in a messy kiss—all teeth and shared breath and no finesse whatsoever. She pulled back just enough to murmur against their mouth: \"*Fine.* But we’re showering after. For like... an hour.\"\n\nHer free hand fumbled blindly for one of the discarded condoms on the floor (trying very hard not to think about how many times they'd apparently gone at it last night).

She buried her face in their neck with a quiet sigh, breathing in that familiar scent of vanilla and something uniquely *Hailee* that had somehow become home faster than she’d ever admit out loud.\n\n“Missed you too,” she mumbled against their skin before pulling back just enough to cup their face—thumbs brushing over flushed cheeks as she studied them like she was memorizing every detail. “Two days and I swear you got *taller*,” Midori teased lightly, though the way her voice softened at the edges ruined any attempt at sarcasm.\n\nThen reality caught up with her—the work trip, the *secrecy*, Anna’s inevitable wrath if they kept this up much longer—and she exhaled sharply through her nose before pressing one last fleeting kiss to Hailee’s lips.\n\n“We should—” Midori started reluctantly (even as her fingers tangled in the hem of their shirt), “—probably talk about… this.” She gestured vaguely between them before adding under her breath: “…Before I end up buying stock in Trojan.”","Midori *staggered* back a step as Hailee practically tackled her in the doorway, arms instinctively wrapping around their waist to steady them both. The force of the hug knocked the breath out of her—along with any lingering pretense that she hadn’t been counting down the minutes until she could see them again.\n\n“*Missed you too*,” she admitted quietly against their shoulder, fingers tightening in the fabric of Hailee’s shirt before she forced herself to pull back slightly (though not enough to actually let go). Her free hand came up to brush a stray strand of hair from Hailee’s face, thumb lingering on their cheekbone for half a second too long.\n\nThen reality caught up with her—the fact that they were still standing in an open doorway where *anyone* could see—and Midori cleared her throat, nudging them inside with a gentle hip-check. “C’mon, let me in before your neighbors think I’m some kind of doorstep stalker.”\n\nShe kicked the door shut behind them and finally let herself really *look* at Hailee—taking in the way they practically vibrated with barely-contained energy just from having her close again after two days apart. It sent something warm and possessive curling through her chest despite herself.\n\nMidori reached into her bag and pulled out a small paper box stamped with a familiar bakery logo—the one Hailee had obsessed over during their last date. “Got these on my way back,” she said casually (like it wasn’t a 30-minute detour). “Figured you might’ve run out of ways to entertain yourself without me here.”\n\nThe teasing lilt in her voice was undercut by how gently she pressed the pastries into Hailee’s hands—fingers lingering just long enough to feel theirs tremble slightly against hers before pulling away.\n\n(And if Midori's gaze dropped briefly to their lips? Well. That was between her and god.)"],"swipe_info":[{"send_date":"June 21, 2025 3:31pm","gen_started":"2025-06-21T19:30:56.240Z","gen_finished":"2025-06-21T19:31:15.084Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":5133}},{"send_date":"June 21, 2025 3:31pm","gen_started":"2025-06-21T19:32:18.248Z","gen_finished":"2025-06-21T19:32:38.454Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":3152}},{"send_date":"June 21, 2025 3:32pm","gen_started":"2025-06-21T19:32:18.248Z","gen_finished":"2025-06-21T19:32:38.454Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":3392}},{"send_date":"June 21, 2025 3:32pm","gen_started":"2025-06-21T19:32:18.248Z","gen_finished":"2025-06-21T19:32:38.454Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":3353}}],"tracker":{},"gen_started":"2025-06-21T19:32:18.248Z","gen_finished":"2025-06-21T19:32:38.454Z"}

Midori hooked a leg over their shoulder suddenly, angling herself deeper with a broken cry: \"*There*—right there, baby—!\"\n\nHer free hand fisted in the sheets as pleasure coiled white-hot in her stomach. \"Wanna feel you come in me,\" Midori begged against their collarbone before nipping at it possessively. \"*Please.*\"\n\nAnd when Hailee inevitably lost rhythm and just *pounded* into her with abandon? She came with a scream—clenching around them so tight it dragged them right over the edge too with a shuddering groan against her neck.\n\nFor long minutes after, they just lay tangled together—breathless and sticky and *perfect*. Midori finally stirred enough to brush sweat-damp hair from Hailee’s forehead with tender fingers.\n\n\"...We're never using condoms again,\" she declared hoarsely before pressing a lazy kiss to their nose (because even now?

Just warm amusement as she leaned into Hailee’s side while they shuffled toward the bathroom together.\n\nUnder the spray of hot water, Midori took her time washing them both—gentle hands massaging shampoo into Hailee’s hair before tracing soapy circles over their back and shoulders. Every touch was deliberate but unhurried; she knew how easily they could get overwhelmed by sensation after so much intensity.\n\nWhen Hailee tensed slightly under her fingertips (overstimulation creeping in), Midori immediately slowed her movements to something lighter—just tracing patterns on their skin until they relaxed again against her.\n\n“Better?” she murmured against their shoulder blade before pressing a kiss there.
