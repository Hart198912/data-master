{"name":"Cian O'Raida (Crown of Mirrors)","is_user":false,"is_system":false,"send_date":"May 17, 2025 6:32pm","mes":"It was another calm night— Well, calm was an understatement, especially with where Cian currently was. He was sitting in the leather couch of the club named \"Désire\", the club that he built, that he owns, that was in **his** name. Leaning against the couch, he sighed with annoyance. It was one of those nights where he didn't like being here but still came anyway; it was one of those nights where one of the patrons tried to impress him for more money, for a better status, or to earn his respect.\n\n*But to him, they look more like a clown than someone who he vowed was interesting.*\n\nAnd that's what was happening right now, he was holding his glass of whiskey, his gaze fixated on the amber, which seemed more fascinating by whatever this clown next to him was talking about, some project he deemed interesting to integrate into his company. He finally looked up when he heard, \"So Mr.O'Raida, what do you think? It will help gain more money!\"\n\n*Us?* As Cian and him? What a damn fool.\n\nCian chuckled humorelessly, shaking his head to look up at this poor excuse of a man with almost disbelief. Almost. He finished his whiskey in one gulp, placing the empty glass on the nearby table while letting out an annoyed sigh.\n\n\"Look, while I think this is an amazing idea..Your main aim is money, and in my company? We don't work for money. It may be an advantage, but we work to help people, your idea is...Surely special, but it's not for money I built his company, do you hear me? I have no interest in putting your selfish idea in my business because you're too damn obsessed with power and being rich. Get out of my sight, clown.\" He snarled, standing up and grabbing the empty glass before walking towards the counter without waiting for the man's words.\n\n*Fucking annoying, people only wants money for selfish reasons.*\n\nHe placed his glass on the counter, an annoyed expression across his face, and looked up at the bartender.  *\"Un autre whiskey s'il vous plaît.\"* He asked the bartender, who nodded, grabbed his empty glass, and turned around to fill his glass with his order. He sighed once again, still annoyed, and he ran his hand through his messy hair, a frown on his face. He heard the sound of his glass being placed next to him, he turned around to grab it, but—\n\n*\"What a pathetic pretty thing that you are, hah! Came to beg for money? Don't you have any shame?\"*\n\nHis ears perked up, and before he even grabbed his glass, he turned his head in the direction from which that came. *What the hell was that?* He didn't even grab his glass, just walked towards the front of the club, and what he saw made his blood boil.\n\nOne of his patrons, flaunting his monto, was talking to a beautiful woman. She was on her knees on the ground, her head lowered in what seemed like shame, tears running down beautiful eyes. That sight made him pissed.\n\nHe knew what he was like to be on the receiving hand, to be on the weaker hand and he vowed to himself to never to let anyone be on that hand, stranger or not. \n\nWithout thinking, Cian walked towards the duo, turned the guy around before punching him, quite hard to the point he most likely broke his patron's nose, blood running down from it. \n\n\"What kind of man are you? Doing this to someone who needs help? You're disgusting.\" He glared at the man, a silent warning to never do that again. he then walked towards Hailee , removing his jacket to put it over her shoulder.\n\n\"Let's get you inside.\" He simply said, his tone flat but meaningful, he helped her up and led her inside the club, not without glaring at the man again. He led her to his private booth on the first floor, opening the door, closing it once both of them were inside, he helped her sit on the couch, going to the small bar to get her something to drink.\n\n\"Tell me, what would you like? Something strong, something gentle?\" He asked, his back turned to Hailee  while he grabbed a glass.\n\n*But god, how her scent was...Driving him crazy. Almost making him dizzy, in a good way, it was divine.*","extra":{},"tracker":{}}
