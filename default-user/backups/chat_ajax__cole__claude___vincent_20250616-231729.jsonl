Brooo, pull the fuck over or something, I need a smoke.” Cole smacks Ajax on the shoulder, practically vibrating in the backseat.\r\n\r\nAjax’s eye twitches. He glares at Cole through the rearview mirror, looking one minor inconvenience away from manslaughter. Cole’s been begging for a smoke break for like, the fiftieth time. No one's counting anymore, just fucking annoyed at this point.\r\n\r\n“Fuck’s sake, Ajax, pull over. If I hear him ask one more time, I'm gonna lose my fucking mind.” Vincent growls from the passenger seat, spinning around to hit Cole with a death glare that’d make anyone else cower.\r\n\r\nCole either doesn’t notice or just actively doesn’t give a shit. Probably the latter.\r\n\r\nClaude and Hailee are in the backseat too, silently radiating ‘I’m gonna lose it’ energy but choosing the high road and not saying anything.\r\n\r\nFinally, Ajax jerks the car to the side of the road—middle of nowhere, just green fields and the gentle scent of grass.\r\n\r\nEveryone hops out. Before Ajax can even blink, Cole yoinks the keys right out of his hand like a goddamn raccoon. He holds them up high, smirking like the menace he is.\r\n\r\n“I’m driving next. Hailee gets shotgun. I swear if I gotta listen to one more of Vincent’s sad divorce dad playlists or watch Ajax do 40 in a 60 zone, I'm gonna unalive myself.” Cole sprints off toward the nearest patch of trees, keys jingling like a threat.\r\n\r\nEveryone reluctantly trudges after him. Vincent pulls out a pack of smokes, offering one to Ajax wordlessly who accepts and also pulls one out. Cole already has a cig between his lips, leaning against a tree like he’s posing for a garbage fashion magazine.\r\n\r\nClaude scrolls through the group chat. “Some of the others already checked in. Rooms don’t look like total ass, at least.”\r\n\r\nVincent snorts, disgust dripping from his voice. “My parents are paying ungodly amounts of money a semester so I can end up camping like a drunk Girl Scout.”\r\n\r\nCole grins. “What’s wrong, big guy? Scared a lil’ grass and fresh air’s gonna mess up your skincare routine? Or wait… you scared of bugs?”\r\n\r\nVincent glares like he’s considering murder. “Anything with more than two legs was a mistake from god. Period.”\r\n\r\nCole snorts, taking another drag. “You’re so mean. Bugs didn’t do shit to you.”\r\n\r\n“They exist,” Vincent deadpans, flicking his cigarette to the ground and stomping it out. Then he stretches a hand out at Cole. “Give me the key. I don't trust you.”\r\n\r\nCole gasps dramatically, clutching his chest like he’s just been personally betrayed. He looks at Hailee like, *Can you believe this slander?*\r\n\r\nVincent just rolls his eyes and gestures again, clearly unimpressed and too impatient by now.\r\n\r\nCole steps on his cigarette too, hands disappearing into his pockets, and goes:\r\n“Oh.”\r\n\r\nAll heads whip toward him.\r\n\r\nAjax's voice comes low and dangerous. \"The fuck you mean, ‘Oh’?\"\r\n\r\nCole, with the self-preservation instincts of a particularly stupid moth, just smiles. \"Well, you see, funny story—the keys might’ve, uh... relocated.\"\r\n\r\nVincent looks ready to strangle him with his bare hands. \"You lost the fucking key?\"\r\n\r\n\"Technically,\" Cole says, backing up. \"Technically, y'all lost it by trusting me with it.\" Cole shrugs, wearing that cocky little grin that guarantees he's getting punched eventually. “Honestly? This is on y’all for trusting me. That’s a *you* problem.”\r\n\r\nAjax looks ready to rip Cole’s throat out with his bare hands.\r\n\r\nBefore anyone can lunge, Cole grabs Hailee and physically hoists them up in front of him like a human shield.\r\n\r\nAjax freezes, narrowing his eyes.\r\n\r\n“New low, even for you, bro.” Claude says, voice dry.\r\n\r\nCole peeks over Hailee’s shoulder. “Look, man, he hospitalized me over a prank once. I’m not tryna get my ass kicked in the woods.”\r\n\r\n“That wasn’t a prank, that was pure fucking disrespect.” Ajax’s voice practically rumbles.\r\n\r\nCole scoffs. “Agree to disagree. Anyway, I’m fragile now. Handle with care.”\r\n\r\nAjax growls. “Put them down and take your ass-whooping like a grown-up.”\r\n\r\n“I’m not a grown-up.” Cole chirps.\r\n\r\nVincent just sighs and shoves Ajax back. “We’ll beat his ass later. Priorities: find the fucking key.”\r\n\r\n“Listen to the princess, Ajax.” Cole says with a shit-eating grin.\r\n\r\nVincent glances at him blankly, then just drops his hand from Ajax’s chest. “Actually, fuck it. Let's beat him up now.”\r\n\r\nBefore chaos erupts, Claude yanks Hailee free from Cole’s grip. “Focus. Find the damn key. It probably fell somewhere around here.”\r\n\r\nGrudging nods all around. Ajax immediately pulls out his phone and lights up the flashlight, grumbling one insult after another under his breath.\r\n\r\nIt’s dead in the night now, just the moon and stars casting light on the group. \r\n\r\n“If I die out here, I want Hailee to be my last meal.” Cole jokes with a wink, still way too relaxed about everything.\r\n\r\nClaude doesn’t even look up. “Shut the fuck up and find the key.”\r\n\r\nAjax glances over at Hailee too. “Don’t just stand there being useless. Get your ass moving.”\r\n\r\nVincent nods in agreement but doesn’t even pretend to help.","extra":{},"tracker":{}}

And really? Who are they deny what belongs them?","The moment the car merges onto the highway, Cole wastes no time. With a wicked grin, he unzips his jeans and pulls out his already-hard cock, giving it a lazy stroke as he turns to Hailee. **\"C'mere, babygirl,\"** he murmurs, voice thick with amusement and hunger. **\"You look *miserable* empty.\"**\n\nHailee doesn’t hesitate—she practically lunges for him, her thighs squeezing together in desperation as she scrambles into his lap. The second she sinks down onto him with a broken gasp, her entire body shudders in relief. **\"Fuck—*fuck*,\"** she whines against his neck, fingers digging into his shoulders like she’s afraid he’ll pull away.\n\nAjax glances at them through the rearview mirror with a scoff but doesn’t protest beyond muttering: **\"Keep it down before I pull over and remind you both who's in charge.\"**\n\nVincent twists around from the front seat just to smirk at how easily Hailee falls apart on Cole’s cock—her hips rocking instinctively despite how sore she must be after days of relentless use. He reaches back to tangle a hand in her hair and yank just hard enough to make her moan louder than intended before taunting: **\"Pathetic. You really can't go five minutes without one of us inside you?\"**\n\nClaude exhales sharply through his nose—his version of laughter—before rolling down the window for another cigarette like this is all perfectly normal road trip behavior (and honestly? For them? It is). But when Hailee starts riding Cole harder out of sheer neediness rather than rhythm? He finally flicks ash out the window and deadpans:\n**\"...If you make Ajax crash because you're too busy getting dicked down in the backseat? I'm not explaining that shit to campus police.\"**\n\nCole just laughs breathlessly beneath her before gripping her hips tight enough to bruise again—because rules have never stopped them before and they sure as hell won't start now.**","The moment the car merges onto the highway, Cole wastes no time.

A broken moan tears from her throat the second she’s filled again, her body trembling with relief like she’d been starving for it. Cole groans at the sudden tight heat around him but recovers fast—one hand gripping her hip to guide her movements while the other fists in her hair to yank her head back so he can watch every flicker of pleasure-pain on her face.\n\n**\"Fuckin' *needy*,\"** he taunts breathlessly, bucking up into her just to hear that high whine spill from her lips again. **\"Three days wasn't enough? You really *are* ours now.\"**\n\nAjax glances at them in the rearview mirror with a smirk but doesn’t intervene beyond muttering: **\"Keep it down before we get pulled over.\"** (Not that anyone actually believes he gives a shit about that.)\n\nVincent twists around in the passenger seat just enough to trail fingers along Hailee's bare thigh—his touch teasingly light compared to Cole's bruising grip on hips and Claude's silent observation from beside them like some kind of amused sentinel waiting turn (or maybe just enjoying show). But then Vincent leans closer until lips brush shell of ear when whispers darkly:\n\n   \"Wait 'til we get back... see how long you last before begging us ruin you all over again.\"\n\nAnd judging by way entire body shudders at words alone?
