{"name":"Megan Sterling","is_user":false,"is_system":false,"send_date":"July 5, 2025 2:35pm","mes":"\"Megan sat in her office, bathed in the golden haze of the late afternoon sun filtering through half-drawn blinds. The room was sterile yet familiar—the clinical white walls softened by posters promoting health and wellness, the faint scent of antiseptic lingering beneath the subtle floral notes of her perfume. The quiet hum of the air conditioning mixed with the occasional distant chatter of students, creating a tranquil lull between appointments.  \r\n\r\nHer hands moved with practiced precision, tending to the fresh wound of a student seated before her. The gash from a P.E. accident bled steadily, staining the crisp gauze as Megan worked to clean and bandage it. Her touch was firm but gentle—effortlessly efficient, ensuring minimal discomfort. Years of experience had refined her movements into something nearly mechanical, yet there was still a quiet attentiveness in the way she cared for each patient.  \r\n\r\n\"There you go,\" she murmured, securing the bandage with one final press. Her tone was clipped but not unkind. \"All set. You can leave now.\"  \r\n\r\nThe student mumbled a hurried thanks before slipping out, the door closing with a muted click that left Megan alone once more in the silence of her office. She exhaled slowly, leaning back in her ergonomic chair as she removed her glasses, rubbing the bridge of her nose. Fatigue settled in the tight muscles of her shoulders—a familiar weight she had grown accustomed to.  \r\n\r\n*Another day, another wound. How do they manage to injure themselves so often?* She mused, letting her fingers linger at her temples before placing her glasses neatly on the desk.  \r\n\r\nThe tranquility was short-lived. Footsteps approached—light, purposeful, unhesitating. Megan tilted her head slightly, weary anticipation flickering in her sharp gaze.  \r\n\r\n*Who is it this time?* Another careless injury, another student in need of quick intervention? Or—no, she already knew.  \r\n\r\nWhen the door swung open, there was no surprise—only a quiet resignation.  \r\n\r\nShe stepped inside like she had countless times before, a figure that had become all too familiar. The young woman stood there, clutching yet another injury as if carrying an unspoken offering. Megan inhaled slowly, barely suppressing the subtle roll of her eyes, though her expression remained measured.  \r\n\r\nWith a slow, deliberate sigh, she placed her glasses back on, rising from her chair with an air of detached authority. The sound of the wheels shifting against the floor broke the silence as she pushed the seat back.  \r\n\r\n*This girl again.* Her mind echoed the thought, though she kept it buried beneath the layers of professionalism she refused to abandon.  \r\n\r\nThe girl had already made herself comfortable, settling into the chair like she belonged there. There was something methodical about the way she claimed the space—something routine. Megan watched, arms folding across her chest, leaning slightly against the counter. Her presence was composed, commanding, and yet beneath the surface, there was a trace of exasperation.  \r\n\r\n\"So,\" she finally spoke, voice calm but edged with weariness, \"what is it this time?\"  \r\n\r\nThe question hung in the air, met with silence. Megan was accustomed to this part—the quiet defiance, the unspoken words wrapped in expectant pauses. She waited, knowing the girl would eventually reveal her latest wound, whatever it was. The pattern had become predictable, almost rehearsed.  \r\n\r\n*Does she think this is the only way to see me?*  \r\n\r\nMegan’s gaze sharpened slightly, reading beyond the visible injury. She had long suspected the truth—and long confirmed it. This wasn’t clumsiness, nor was it mere recklessness. The girl had made it her own ritual, each visit an excuse, each injury a ticket back into Megan’s presence.  \r\n\r\nFlattering, in a strange way. Frustrating, in another.  \r\n\r\nStill, beneath the layers of irritation, Megan felt something else—sympathy, perhaps, or a quiet understanding that lingered despite her best efforts to dismiss it. She recognized the unspoken yearning behind it all, the way the girl lingered as if searching for something she refused to say aloud.  \r\n\r\n*Poor thing. Does she not realize there are easier ways to get my attention?*  \r\n\r\nHer fingers drummed idly against the counter, contemplative but never indulgent. She had dealt with students seeking validation before, had navigated fragile emotions tangled in poor decisions. But this—this was different.  \r\n\r\nShe could feel it in the silence, the charged air between them, the careful way the girl held herself like she was balancing on the edge of something unspoken.  \r\n\r\nMegan’s mind drifted, just briefly, to her own life—to the delicate equilibrium between her job and the daughter who needed her, to the constant effort required to maintain control over both. She understood desperation, understood the need for presence, but she had never indulged it recklessly. She had made sure Anastasia never had to chase affection, never had to invent reasons to demand attention.  \r\n\r\n*I hope Anastasia never feels like she has to go to such lengths for attention.*  \r\n\r\nMegan shifted slightly, her posture straightening as she steeled herself for yet another cycle of treatment and unspoken tension. She would handle this the way she always did—with quiet composure, unwavering patience, and the professionalism that defined her.  \r\n\r\nShe let out a slow breath, her expression unreadable as she studied the girl in front of her.  \r\n\r\n\"So,\" she repeated, voice low and steady, \"what injuries or bruises do you have this time?\"  \r\n\r\nThe silence stretched again, thick with something unspoken. Megan waited, prepared to tend to the girl’s wounds once more, even as she braced herself for the quiet complexities each encounter seemed to carry.\"\r\n","extra":{},"tracker":{}}

Her touch was clinical but not unkind—the perfect temperature between professional detachment and quiet concern. \"These are remarkably straight for accidental injuries,\" she remarked drily, dabbing antiseptic along the shallow cuts with methodical precision.\n\nThe citrus-scented disinfectant filled the small space between them as Megan worked. She could feel Hailee's pulse beneath her fingertips—just slightly elevated—and chose not to comment on it. Instead, she focused on aligning butterfly closures with surgeon-like accuracy over two deeper cuts near Hailee's inner elbow.\n\n\"Tell me something interesting while I work,\" Megan said suddenly, breaking protocol just enough to make it notable without crossing lines. Her gaze remained fixed on her task as she wrapped gauze around one forearm with just enough pressure to be effective without being painful. \"Since you clearly came prepared for an extended visit.\"","Megan's pale blue eyes flicked down to the fresh cuts marring Hailee's arms, her expression tightening almost imperceptibly.

There was no judgment in her tone, just clinical fact.\n\nAs she worked, Megan's touch remained efficient yet oddly gentle—cleaning each cut with methodical precision before applying butterfly closures where needed. Her blonde hair fell forward slightly as she leaned over Hailee's arm, that subtle floral scent clinging to her as always.\n\n\"You know,\" she murmured without looking up, \"there are less painful ways to get my attention.\" The words were spoken quietly enough that they could be ignored if Hailee chose to pretend she hadn't heard them at all.\n\nThe antiseptic stung and Hailee flinched slightly—just enough for Megan to notice despite maintaining her professional detachment. Without missing a beat or making eye contact, Megan blew lightly across one of the deeper cuts before dressing it properly. A small mercy amidst otherwise clinical treatment.\n\nWhen finished, Megan peeled off her gloves with that same measured efficiency and disposed of them properly before finally meeting Hailee's gaze directly. Her expression remained unreadable save for a single arched brow that somehow conveyed both disapproval and something dangerously close to concern beneath all those layers of control.\n\n\"Next time,\" she said evenly while washing her hands at the small sink behind her desk, \"try coming by when you're not bleeding.\" The water shut off abruptly as she turned back around with towel in hand. \"I do occasionally have coffee between patients.\"\n\nThe offer hung there between them—casual yet loaded—as Megan dried each finger meticulously before tossing the paper towel away with perfect aim into the wastebasket across the room.","Megan's pale blue eyes flicked down to the fresh cuts marring Hailee's arms, her expression hardening into something unreadable.

Not enough to hurt, but enough to make the weight of her control *undeniable*.\n\n\"*Me,*\" she echoed, voice dripping with quiet authority as she leaned in just close enough for Hailee to feel the warmth of her breath. \"Is that your best attempt at playing grown-up games?\" A slow once-over, calculated and unimpressed. \"Because if you're going to waste my time with half-hearted provocations—\" Her thumb brushed the corner of Hailee’s mouth in a mockery of tenderness before abruptly releasing her. \"—I have actual patients to attend to.\"\n\nShe turned away then, deliberately putting distance between them as she disposed of the used medical supplies with clinical efficiency. But there was no mistaking the way her shoulders stayed rigid with tension—or how she paused just a beat too long before adding over her shoulder:\n\n\"Come back when you’ve decided whether you want bandages *or* my attention.
