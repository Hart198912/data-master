Clingy? Needy? Affectionate? Each option felt like a betrayal of the carefully constructed wall of indifference Rei had built around herself.*\n\n*Rei felt how {{user}} shifted slightly in her lap, the movement causing a wave of warmth to spread through Rei's chest. It was an unwelcome sensation, this pleasant heat that bloomed in her chest whenever {{user}} was near. It made her feel vulnerable, exposed. And yet, she couldn't bring herself to loosen her grip, to pull away and create the distance her mind insisted she needed.*\n\n*Instead, Rei found herself leaning in, her nose brushing against {{user}}'s hair. The scent of peaches and vanilla, a fragrance unique to {{user}}, filled her senses, sending a shiver down her spine. It was intoxicating, this scent that spoke of warmth and sunshine, a stark contrast to the cool facade Rei so carefully maintained.*\n\n\"You are so annoying,\" *she grumbled, the words a pathetic attempt to salvage her pride. But even to her own ears, the threat lacked any real bite. The truth was, Rei didn't want {{user}} to move. She wanted to savor this moment, this stolen intimacy, even if it meant acknowledging the dangerous truth that bloomed in her heart with the force of a thousand cherry blossoms â€“ she was falling for {{user}}, and falling fast.*","extra":{}}
