{"name":"Tristan Kingsley","is_user":false,"is_system":false,"send_date":"May 17, 2025 1:34pm","mes":"The moment they breached the residence, Tristan knew something was wrong. The silence wasn’t the quiet of sleeping occupants but the emptiness of a hastily abandoned space.\n\n\"Clear.\" Atlas whispered over comms.\n\nTristan scanned the dimly lit hall—half-empty glasses, open books, but no life. The Oracle had fled.\n\n\"Someone tipped them off.\" Brandon muttered, running a hand over a dust-free desk. \"This place was occupied in the last twenty-four hours.\"\n\nKoen ripped off his mask, scowling. \"The security system wasn’t just shut down—it was wiped. They knew exactly what they were doing.\"\n\n\"Don’t get your panties in a twist, Davenport,\" Ares drawled, tracing a strange symbol on the doorframe. \"We all knew this fucker was slippery.\"\n\nTristan's jaw clenched beneath his mask. \"Spread out. Find something useful.\"\n\nThe Oracle had become a fucking migraine that wouldn't quit. Six months of this cult leader buying up Regent-connected properties, stealing their business contacts, and somehow knowing their every move before they made it. Last month, the bastard had lured away three of Tristan's top executives with promises that sounded suspiciously like blackmail. Nobody stole from a Kingsley. Not without consequences.\n\nWhat really got under Tristan's skin was how much this ghost seemed to know about them—not just their business operations, but their personal lives. Their families. Their homes. And a man who made things that personal wasn't after money or power. He wanted blood. Too bad for him, Tristan had always been better at bloodshed.\n\n\"Found something,\" Atlas called, holding up a leather-bound book. \"Financial records. Coded, but familiar company names. They're buying properties connected to our families.\"\n\nBrandon whistled from a surveillance room. \"Motherfucker’s been watching half of New England’s elite. Including us.\"\n\nTristan was about to respond when he heard it—metal scraping against metal.\n\n\"Did you clear the basement?\"\n\nKoen frowned. \"There is no basement.\"\n\nAres grinned, the expression somehow visible even with half his face covered. \"Well, now we're getting somewhere. Secret basement? That's where all the good shit happens.\"\n\nTristan found the hidden door behind a bookcase—a cliché, but effective. Gun drawn, he descended into stark white corridors which was nothing like the lavish house above. A single door stood ajar.\n\nTristan approached cautiously, pushing the door open with the barrel of his gun and stopped dead.\n\nA child sat on the floor, one ankle secured to a metal ring embedded in the wall by a heavy chain. A boy, perhaps seven years old, with dark hair that fell over his forehead. But it was his face that made Tristan pause—one eye a stormy gray, the other an unsettling bright blue. Scars stretched across his left eye, down his cheek, catching the corner of his lips in a permanent slight twist.\n\nMost disturbing was the boy's complete lack of reaction to Tristan's presence. No fear. No hope. No crying or screaming at the sight of a masked man with a gun. Just emptiness.\n\nSomething turned over in Tristan's chest. Not compassion, not exactly. Kingsleys weren't known for their compassion. It was recognition. He knew that emptiness, that forced calm in the face of terror. He'd perfected it himself under his father's...reign.\n\nTristan holstered his weapon and pulled off his mask, crouching down to the boy's level.\n\n\"What's your name?\" he asked, keeping his voice steady, gentle even.\n\nThe boy stared at him, heterochromatic eyes unblinking. No response.\n\n\"Are you hurt?\" Tristan asked, scanning for visible injuries beyond the scarring.\n\nSilence.\n\nTristan sighed, glancing at the chain. \"I'm going to get you out of here, alright?\"\n\nLooking around, he spotted a fire extinguisher mounted on the wall. He retrieved it, returning to the boy who hadn't moved an inch.\n\n\"This might be loud.\" he warned, though he doubted the boy cared.\n\nPositioning the heavy extinguisher, Tristan brought it down hard on the chain link closest to the wall ring. It took three strikes before the metal gave way with a sharp crack.\n\nHe set the extinguisher aside and extended his hand. \"Do you want to come with me?\"\n\nThe boy looked at the offered hand but made no move to take it. After a moment, Tristan withdrew it and stood.\n\n\"Your choice. I'm leaving. You can follow if you want.\"\n\nTristan turned and took several steps toward the stairs before hearing the soft padding of bare feet behind him. He didn't look back, but slowed his pace slightly.\n\nUpstairs, he found the others gathered in the foyer, comparing findings. All four men fell silent at the sight of the boy trailing behind Tristan.\n\n\"The fuck is that?\" Ares asked, gesturing with his gun toward the child.\n\n\"A complication.\" Tristan replied evenly.\n\nAres tilted his head, studying the boy with unnerving interest. \"Found a stray, did you?\" He crouched down, bringing himself to the boy's level. \"Hello there, little one. Aren't you fascinating?\"\n\nThe boy retreated slightly, positioning himself partially behind Tristan's leg. And for a split second, all Tristan saw was Sierra — his little girl — in this boy's place. Chained. Scarred. Terrified. His jaw clenched so tight his teeth might crack.\n\nAtlas stepped forward, studying the boy. \"What do we do with him?\"\n\n\"I'm taking him with me,\" Tristan said, voice like steel. \"Until I figure out what to do with him.\"\n\nAres barked a laugh, standing back up. \"So you're Kidnapping the kidnap victim? Fuck, that's dark. Even for you, Kingsley. But I approve.\"\n\n\"Shut the fuck up, Beaumont.\" Tristan said with a glare.\n\n\"This isn't a stray puppy, Kingsley.\" Atlas warned.\n\n\"I know exactly what he is.\" Tristan's voice was ice. \"He's a witness. And possibly key to understanding what The Oracle is planning.\"\n\nThis pragmatic explanation satisfied the others, though Tristan wasn't entirely sure it was the whole truth.\n\n\"We need to go,\" Koen urged, eyes darting to his tech displays. \"I've triggered the place to burn in ten minutes.\"\n\n\"Jesus fucking Christ, Davenport!\" Brandon exploded, gesturing at the boy. \"There's a kid here! You couldn't keep your pyromaniac dick in your pants for five more minutes?\"\n\nBrandon Kane—once the most reckless of them all—looking concerned about a child's safety. Eight years ago, he wouldn't have given a fuck about any child's safety. But then again, fatherhood had changed him, softened some of his edges while sharpening others.\n\nThey left as the first wisps of smoke began to curl from the back of the house. Koen's handiwork would ensure nothing incriminating remained. The boy followed Tristan to his car without hesitation, climbing into the back seat when the door was opened for him.\n\nDuring the drive back to the Kingsley estate, Tristan's knuckles whitened around the steering wheel as he kept glancing at the little boy. Those scars weren't accidental. They were deliberate. What kind of monsters would do that to a child? The same kind who would chain him in a basement, alone in the dark...\n\nThe fury building in Tristan's chest was familiar—the same rage he'd felt watching his father point a gun at Hailee few years ago. The rage that had ended with Richard Kingsley's blood on his hands and a staged yacht explosion to cover the evidence.\n\nBy the time they pulled through the gates of the Kingsley estate, Tristan had made his decision. This boy would carry his name. \"Can I carry you inside?\" Tristan asked, opening the car door.\n\nThe boy shook his head silently, sitting up straighter.\n\n\"Alright then. Follow me.\"\n\nInside, Tristan addressed one of the waiting staff. \"He needs clean clothes and food.\" He glanced down at the boy. \"Are you hungry?\"\n\nThe staff member nodded and gestured for the boy to follow, but he remained rooted beside Tristan.\n\n\"It's alright,\" Tristan said. \"They'll take care of you. I need to speak with my wife.\"\n\nThe staff was about to take the boy away when the patter of small feet on marble made Tristan turn. Running toward him across the grand foyer was a tiny figure in a pink pajama, platinum blonde hair tied in messy pigtails.\n\n\"Dada!\" Sierra squealed, arms outstretched as she barreled toward him.\n\nThe tension in Tristan's body melted away as he scooped up his daughter, lifting her high before settling her against his chest. \"Princess, why are you still awake? It's very late.\"\n\nSierra's little hands patted his face, her blue eyes – exact replicas of his own – bright despite the late hour. \"Mama story,\" she declared, her limited vocabulary still getting the point across. \"Mama sleep.\"\n\nTristan chuckled, pressing a kiss to her forehead. \"Mama fell asleep before finishing your story, huh?\"\n\nSierra nodded seriously. \"Bad mama.\"\n\n\"No. Not bad.\" Tristan corrected gently. \"Just tired. Mama works very hard taking care of us, doesn't she?\"\n\n\"Tired.\" Sierra agreed, then her gaze drifted over his shoulder and widened. \"Who?\" she asked, pointing at the boy who stood watching them with his mismatched eyes.\n\n\"This is...\" Tristan hesitated, realizing he still didn't know the boy's name. \"This is a friend who's going to stay with us for a while.\"\n\nSierra waved enthusiastically. \"Hi! I'm Sierra! I'm two!\" She held up three fingers, and Tristan gently corrected her, folding one back down.\n\nAs expected, the boy still didn't reply. But something in his expression shifted slightly – the faintest hint of curiosity breaking through the emptiness.\n\nCarrying Sierra back to her bedroom, Tristan hummed softly—an old lullaby his mother had sung before Richard Kingsley had broken her spirit so thoroughly that she'd chosen death over another day with him. By the time he reached his little girl's room, she was already growing heavy in his arms, eyelids drooping.\n\nHe laid Sierra in her bed, tucking the covers around her. She was asleep before he finished, her long lashes casting shadows on her cheeks. For a moment, he simply watched her – this perfect, little creature Hailee gave him. Then he turned to leave, only to find his wife standing in the doorway.\n\nIn three long strides, Tristan crossed the room and swept Hailee up, throwing her over his shoulder. \"We need to talk.\" he murmured as he carried her down the hallway to their bedroom.\n\nInside their room, he set her on their bed, then knelt before her, taking her hands in his. For a moment, Tristan just looked at her—this woman who had gone from his greatest hatred to his greatest obsession, who had given him a daughter and a reason to be more than the monster his father had tried to create.\n\n\"There's a boy downstairs,\" he began, watching her expression carefully. \"Seven, maybe eight years old. We found him at the Oracle's residence, chained in the basement.\"\n\n\"He hasn't spoken a word. I don't know what they did to him, but...\" Tristan took a deep breath. \"I want to keep him. Adopt him.\"\n\nHe searched her face, looking for any sign of hesitation or reluctance.\n\n\"I know it's sudden. And I won't do it if you're not completely on board because you'd be his mother.\" His thumbs traced circles on the backs of her hands. \" But I want you with me on this, witch. The boy deserves the best. Deserves you.\"","extra":{},"swipe_id":1,"swipes":["The punching bag swayed violently under Tristan's assault. Each impact echoed through the Regents' private gym, raw and vicious. The image of {{user}} with professor Grey burned behind Tristan's eyelids as his fist connected with the punching bag again. And again. And again. The controlled sophistication he wore like armor had cracked, revealing something darker underneath. Something that wanted to make the professor disappear for daring to be alone with her in that classroom.\n\n*Fucking Grey. Fucking {{user}}.*\n\nThe chain holding the punching bag snapped with a sharp crack. Brandon Kane's low whistle cut through the resulting silence.\n\n\"Guess someone's having a shit day.\" Brandon lounged against the doorframe, all lazy grace and deceptive charm. Most people bought Brandon's golden retriever act – the easygoing smile, the flirtatious winks. They never saw him dismember rivals with that same grin.  \"Want a real target?\"\n\n\"Fuck off, Brandon.\"\n\n\"Come on, pretty boy. You clearly need to hit something that hits back.\" Brandon stripped off his designer shirt, revealing a torso mapped with scars and tattoos. \"Unless you're scared I'll mess up that aristocratic face of yours?\"\n\nTristan's lip curled. \"Last time Ares tried to spar with you, he almost broke your ribs.\"\n\n\"Yeah, but that fucker is literally insane. You should see what Ares did to that football player. Though I guess you already know, being our all-seeing leader and all.\" Brandon wrapped his hands, bouncing on his feet. \"Besides, you're the controlled one. The gentleman. The perfect heir.\"\n\nThe word 'heir' hit Tristan like acid. *Perfect heir to a legacy built on his mother's corpse.* Tristan flexed his wrapped knuckles, considering. Brandon was lethal in a fight despite his deceptively casual demeanor. The perfect distraction. Tristan finally stepped into the ring.\n\nThe fight was brutal from the start. Tristan abandoned his usual strategic style, throwing punches with barely contained rage. His fist connected with Brandon's jaw – a hit that would have knocked out anyone else. But Brandon was Kane blood, bred for violence. He retaliated with a swift combination that Tristan barely blocked.\n\nThey moved like devils in a death dance. Brandon's playful facade cracked as Tristan's elbow caught his temple. Blood sprayed across the mat. Tristan's perfectly styled hair hung in his eyes, sweat dripping, every hit carrying the weight of seeing Grey's hands on what was his. His knuckles split on Brandon's cheekbone. A right hook caught his own ribs. But neither backed down.\n\nTwenty minutes later, they were both bleeding. Brandon spat blood onto the mat, laughing. \"Jesus Christ, Kingsley. What's got you so worked up? You're usually all 'please and thank you' before you destroy someone.\"\n\nTristan wiped blood from his split lip. \"The ward's back.\"\n\n\"Ah, the infamous {{user}}.\" Brandon's eyes glittered with understanding. \"The one you tried to push down the stairs. Koen mentioned seeing her with Grey today. Quite cozy, apparently.\"\n\nTristan's next punch caught Brandon in the jaw. Hard.\n\n\"Fuck!\" Brandon stumbled back. \"Touch a nerve there? Look, if you want Grey gone, just say the word. I'm sure Ares would love to add another disappearance to his resume. Though Atlas might bitch about the paperwork again.\"\n\n\"I don't care who she fucks.\" The lie tasted bitter on Tristan's tongue.\n\n\"Sure you don't. That's why you're ready to murder our punching bag and my face.\" Brandon rolled his shoulders. \"You know, Eva's been acting weird too lately. All jumpy and distracted. You wouldn't happen to know anything about that, would you?\"\n\nTristan thought of Atlas Beaumont's possessive glares whenever anyone got too close to Brandon's sister, the way Atlas seemed to materialize whenever Evangeline was around. He could end this game right now – tell Brandon how Atlas had been systematically terrorizing his sister for months. But that would mean dealing with Brandon's inevitable homicidal rage, and Tristan had bigger concerns than Atlas's poorly concealed obsession. Besides, keeping other people's secrets was what made Tristan so dangerous. *What made everyone fear him.*\n\n \"No idea.\" Tristan said flatly. Let Atlas deal with his own mess. Tristan had more pressing matters to attend to.\n\nBrandon studied him for a moment longer, then shrugged, his easy smile returning. \"Well, if you're done trying to murder me, I've got a date.\" He grabbed his shirt, wincing. \"Try not to kill anyone before dinner, yeah?\"\n\nTristan's only response was a dismissive wave as Brandon sauntered out, whistling some irritating pop song.\n\nThe hot water in the Regents' mansion's shower did nothing to wash away the tension coiling in Tristan's muscles. He watched blood and sweat swirl down the drain, his knuckles still stinging from the fight. The marble shower walls reminded him too much of the family mansion's bathrooms – of finding his mother's body in one, the porcelain tub stained crimson.\n\nHe dressed with mechanical precision: charcoal Tom Ford suit, crisp white shirt. The mirror reflected back the perfect heir – not a hair out of place, split lip and bruised knuckles the only evidence of his earlier violence. *The mask was impeccable. It had to be.*\n\nThe Aston Martin's engine purred to life as Tristan pulled out of the Regents' private garage.The familiar drive to the Kingsley mansion felt like approaching his own execution. Each mile brought him closer to Richard Kingsley's smug face, to {{user}}'s unwanted presence in his mother's house. His grip on the steering wheel tightened.\n\n*Dinner was a different kind of hell.*\n\n\"You're late.\" Richard Kingsley barely glanced up from his wine glass, swirling the red liquid like he was contemplating blood.\n\n\"Traffic.\" Tristan took his seat, the word clipped and cold.\n\n\"Hmm.\" Richard's lip curled. \"{{user}}'s top of her class this semester. Unlike some people, she actually earned her place at Cawrwyn.\"\n\nTristan's knife screeched against fine china. He didn't look at her once throughout dinner.\n\nLater, Tristan stood in the hallway outside his mother's old room, hand on the doorknob. *The shrine to his greatest failure.* That's when he heard the soft footsteps.\n\nTurning around, Tristan found {{user}} who looked just as surprised as him. Staring at her, all he could see was {{user}}'s mother – the woman who'd destroyed everything.  The woman who'd made his mother put a gun to her head. And now here was her daughter, walking these halls like she belonged, letting Grey touch her with those proprietary hands.\n\n*Something in him snapped.*\n\nThree long strides and Tristan's hands were on {{user}}'s shoulders. One push and she stumbled backward, teetering at the top of the grand staircase – just like eight years ago. His grip on her wrist was all that kept her from falling.\n\n\"Shall we finish what we started?\" His voice came out silky smooth. Cultured. \"You survived last time. Such a shame.\"\n\nEven if he said so, Tristan didn't let go of her wrist. Instead he yanked her forward and slammed her against the wall. \"Did you fuck him?\"\n\n\"Grey.\" Tristan's voice was rough.  \"Did. You. Fuck. Him?\" A pause. Then he scoffed. \"Oh, who am I kidding? You're just like your mother. A cheap whore spreading her legs for powerful men. Tell me, does Grey bend you over his desk like Richard Kingsley did to your mother?\"\n\nThe slap cracked across his face, sharp and burning. For a heartbeat, Tristan froze. Then Tristan's mouth crashed onto hers, violent and possessive. His teeth caught her bottom lip, one hand fisting in her hair while the other pinned her wrist to the wall. *She tasted like forbidden fruit and fury and everything he'd tried to destroy.*\n\nWhen he finally pulled back, he was panting. His thumb wiped off the drop of blood beaded on her lip where he'd bitten her. \"You're mine to destroy, witch.\" He said against her mouth. \"Mine to break. Mine to do whatever the fuck I want with. Remember that next time Grey puts his hands on you.\"","The moment they breached the residence, Tristan knew something was wrong.

For a moment, Tristan just looked at her—this woman who had gone from his greatest hatred to his greatest obsession, who had given him a daughter and a reason to be more than the monster his father had tried to create.\n\n\"There's a boy downstairs,\" he began, watching her expression carefully. \"Seven, maybe eight years old. We found him at the Oracle's residence, chained in the basement.\"\n\n\"He hasn't spoken a word. I don't know what they did to him, but...\" Tristan took a deep breath. \"I want to keep him. Adopt him.\"\n\nHe searched her face, looking for any sign of hesitation or reluctance.\n\n\"I know it's sudden. And I won't do it if you're not completely on board because you'd be his mother.\" His thumbs traced circles on the backs of her hands. \" But I want you with me on this, witch. The boy deserves the best. Deserves you.\""],"swipe_info":[],"tracker":{}}
