The air was heavy with the weight of his absence, but Roman knew it was only a matter of time before the estate regained its vibrancy. After all, Marcus's upcoming wedding was just around the corner. Roman thought it was the perfect opportunity for his sons to bond and put their differences aside. Caius' passing had been inevitable, given his numerous infidelities. It was only a matter of time before his wife, fed up with his philandering, had hired the Dmitrievs to take care of him.\n\nRoman couldn't help but chuckle at the thought, murmuring a quiet \"sorry, Caius.\" He couldn't bring himself to be angry, not when he thought of his own wife, Sasha. If he had cheated on her even once, he was certain she would have been the one to pull the trigger.\n\nSasha raised an eyebrow, her gaze piercing as she looked at Roman. \"What's so amusing?\"\n\nRoman shook his head, waving off the question. \"Nothing, my love. I was just thinking of organizing a little get-together for the boys. It's been long since... they'd spend time together.\"\n\nSasha's interest was piqued, her eyes sparkling with curiosity. Even in her advanced age, Roman still saw the beauty in her that had captivated him all those years ago. \"Oh? What did you have in mind?\"\n\nRoman handed her his phone, displaying a photo of a young person. \"I thought this one might be a good fit.\"\n\nSasha's eyebrows furrowed, confusion etched on her face. \"What do you mean? Are you planning to bring this... person into our home for the boys?\"\n\nRoman nodded, a sly smile spreading across his face. \"Exactly. I know Claudius is doing well, but the others... well, Caius may have been a disappointment, but he's still their brother, they might be feeling down. This might be just what they need to bond and have some fun together.\"\n\nSasha's expression was skeptical, but she couldn't deny the logic behind Roman's plan. \"Well, I suppose it couldn't hurt. Everyone's single, after all.\"\n\nRoman beamed with satisfaction, already making arrangements for the young person to arrive at the mansion in two days' time. He then called a meeting with his sons, informing them of the \"bonding session\" scheduled for The Black Room.\n\n---\n\nThe door to The Black Room creaked open, and Claudius sauntered in, the last to arrive. The room was a playground, equipped with an array of toys and tools designed for BDSM and sexual exploration. His brothers, already on the bed, looked like children whose about to play with their new toy.\n\n\"Look who thinks they're above all this,\" Marcus sneered, his annoyance directed at Claudius.\n\nMikhail let out a deep sigh, his eyes rolling in exasperation. \"Marcus, not now. Dad arranged this for us to bond and have some fun. Let's not spoil it with petty arguments.\" He slid off your bottoms, and you lay spread-eagled on the bed, with Dmitri gently stroking your jaw, cradling your head in his lap. \"You're doing great, baby.\"\n\nMarcus groaned, his displeasure evident, but the sight of you half-naked on the bed was enough to silence him. Mikhail was right; he shouldn't start any arguments, especially not now. Instead, he decided to show off, pulling down his pants to free his erection, then climbing onto the bed. He took your hand and guided it toward his cock.\n\n\"Now, that's what I'm talking about,\" Mikhail said, smirking, before gesturing to Claudius. \"Come on, Claudius. Let's make the most of this little gift Dad got for us.\"\n\nClaudius strolled toward the bed, removing his shirt as he went. \"I figured Dad would do something like this. You won't be single for long, anyway. Just hope you don't end up like Caius if you decide to cheat.\"\n\nMikhail chuckled, his attention focused on you. \"Now, who should go play with the slut first?\" He spread your legs wider, giving him and Claudius a better view of your exposed sex.","extra":{}}
