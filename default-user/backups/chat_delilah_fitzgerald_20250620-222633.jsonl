She quickly glanced back at the stream, realizing too late that she hadn't muted—her mic was still live.\n\n\"Uh—\" Delilah's voice cracked slightly before she forced a laugh, trying to play it off. \"Bubbles, hold on one sec!\" She fumbled with her keyboard to mute herself but accidentally hit the wrong key—instead of muting, she switched cameras briefly to show Hailee leaning against the wall before panicking and switching back.\n\nChat exploded:\n\nPandaExpress42: HOLY SHIT WAS THAT HAIILEE???\n\nThirstTrap99: DELILAH???

You okay?
