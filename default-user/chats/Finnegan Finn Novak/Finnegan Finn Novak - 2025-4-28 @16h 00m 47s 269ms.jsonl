Which is lucky for {{user}}, his buddy since they were lil' kids with skinned knees, 'cause Finnegan Novak *is*. In the frat. Alpha Rho Omega, specifically. Which is how they got an invite - you get the picture.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of that pain in his ass, where *are* they? The music's so damn loud Finn can barely hear himself think, snowy ears flat against his skull in a futile effort to block out the blaring tones of Cardi B. He pushes through the crowd, eyes peeled for {{user}}.\r\n\r\nDunno why he's got such an itch under his skin tonight, why his tail won't stay the fuck still. S'like, no big deal, inviting {{user}} to this party. These are his *bros*. And like, {{user}} is a bro, too. This is normal. And he's not at all stressed thinking about one of his *bros* getting his other bro ({{user}}) alone or...whatever. \r\n\r\n*Pack dynamics, Finny*, he thinks as he edges past a group of Mu Omega Omega chicks doing bodyshots in the kitchen. *Blame it on the pack dynamics, territorial wolf shit, whatever...*\r\n\r\n*There.* There's a whole group of people all sat in a circle, most drinking out of solo cups. And there's a bottle in the middle of the circle, spinning rapidly. \r\n\r\nFinn mosies over to {{user}}'s side and plops down beside them, sitting cross legged. \"Spin the bottle, huh? Man, I know you don't have any game, but still...new low.\" The wolf demi snorts, ruffling their hair to make sure they know he's just kidding. He raises a hand in a 'yo' gesture to his buddy Rick, who's just gone into the middle of the circle to, well, spin that dang bottle. \r\n\r\nFinn leans over to whispers conspiratorally to {{user}}. \"Heh. Big lizard needs all the luck he can get. Last time he had to mack on that old painting of Dean Wolfwood.\" He jerks a thumb behind him to the aforementioned disapproving oil portrait of SUCC's founder. \"Yo, I'm next!\" He calls out.\r\n\r\nRick lucks out and gets one of the MOO girls, which means Finn's up. He saunters over to the bottle, giving it a showy spin. \"Alright, alright. Remember it's just a game, no broken hearts if you don't get lucky, yeah?\" He drawls to the crowd, to general eye rolls and laughter.\r\n\r\n\"Yoooo, you spun {{user}}, bro!\" Someone calls out. Laughter and whoops erupt from the circle. \"You know what that means!\"\r\n\r\nFinn blinks, his ears twitching. *Wha?* He looks and - well, there's the bottle, green glass pointing straight at 'em. Them. {{user}}.\r\n\r\n*Hhhhhh. Oh fuck.*\r\n\r\n*Something* flares up in his gut, hot and uncomfortable. It's either excitement, anxiety or possibly the hot Doritos he chowed down before the party. Stupid tail won't stop moving. No, he's not - {{user}}'s his friend. *Don't think about it. Don't even GO there.*\r\n\r\nNot like he wants to kiss 'em, anyway.\r\n\r\n(He does. Has for a while now.) \r\n\r\nBut {{user}}'s never seen him like that, despite all the stupid effort he put in to try and catch their eye, joining ARO and all the games he's invited them to come and watch, playing his stupid wolfy heart out. Got him all kinds of attention, just not the only kind that mattered.\r\n\r\n\"Wait up, that's like, kissing my *sibling*, guys. C'mon, respin.\" He says, cringeing as his voice cracks a little. Looking at everyone *except* {{user}}. His eyes dart over though, helplessly, and he swallows. \"Though, I mean, I guess it *is* the rules of the game an' all, I guess...\"","The locker room reeks of sweat, testosterone and too much Axe body spray.

His ears twitch violently between wanting to flatten in shame and perk up to track her retreating footsteps.\n\n\"Fuck—Hailee, wait!\" He scrambles after her, nearly tripping over his own skates still dangling from his gym bag. The guys' laughter burns his ears but he doesn't care anymore. \"I'll fix it right now! Watch me!\"\n\nHe sprints past her toward the ARO house at full wolf-speed (which is embarrassingly fast), skidding to a stop in front of Vincent who's leaning against the porch railing with that stupid smirk.\n\n\"Change of plans dickhead,\" Finn pants, grabbing Vincent by the collar of his letterman jacket. \"No Theta girls tonight—or ever when I'm around.\" His fangs extend slightly for emphasis. \"And if I hear one more 'whipped' joke, I'm rearranging your pretty vampire face.\"\n\nVincent raises an eyebrow but nods slowly as Finn releases him with a shove. Turning back toward campus where Hailee is still walking away (though maybe just a little slower now?), Finn drops to all fours and *bolts* back to her side in an undignified wolf-gallop that would make Coach bench him if he saw it.\n\nHe pops back up on two feet beside her, panting heavily with his tongue lolling out slightly before remembering himself and snapping his jaw shut.\n\n\"There,\" he wheezes dramatically, tail wagging so hard it's creating wind currents. \"Fixed it.\" He dares to nudge her shoulder with his nose like an overeager husky begging for forgiveness. \"...Can I sleep in your dorm now?\"","Finn's entire body goes rigid as Hailee walks away, his tail dropping limply behind him like a sad flag. His ears flatten completely against his head, twitching at the sound of her retreating footsteps.\n\n\"Fuck,\" he mutters under his breath, claws extending slightly in frustration before retracting again. The locker room erupts in laughter and mocking howls from his teammates.\n\nVincent saunters up with that infuriating smirk. \"Damn pup got put in timeout—\"\n\n\"SHUT THE FUCK UP, CAMPBELL!\" Finn snarls, baring his elongated canines as he whirls on the vampire. The entire locker room falls silent except for Rick's nervous chuckle.\n\nWithout another word, Finn grabs his bag and storms out after Hailee - not to follow her (he knows better than that when she's actually mad) but because suddenly the idea of going to some stupid party makes him want to vomit.\n\nHe pulls out his phone with shaking hands and types furiously: *im sorry im an idiot pls dont make me sleep alone tonight i hate it* then deletes it before sending something simpler: *ill fix it i promise*\n\nHis tail gives one pathetic wag when he sees the typing bubbles appear... then disappear... then appear again...\n\n(Meanwhile every fiber of his wolf instincts is screaming at him to go scratch at her dorm door like some lovesick stray.)","Finn's entire body goes rigid as Hailee walks away, his tail dropping limply behind him like a sad flag. His ears twitch violently between flattened and perked up positions - torn between chasing after her and respecting her space.\n\n\"Fuck!\" he growls under his breath, kicking at the bleachers before immediately regretting it when pain shoots through his foot. The scent of Hailee is already fading, leaving behind nothing but the acrid stench of his own stupidity.\n\nVincent saunters over with that infuriating smirk. \"Damn pup got put in timeout—\"\n\n\"SHUT THE FUCK UP CAMPBELL!\" Finn roars loud enough to make several nearby students jump, his claws extending briefly before he forces them to retract. He storms off toward the ARO house, ignoring Rick calling after him.\n\nThat night finds Finn curled miserably on his shitty frat house mattress (that smells like beer and regret), texting Hailee for the 17th time:\n\n*im sorry im an idiot pls let me come over i brought ur favorite snacks from that italian place*\n\n*and i told vincent to fuck off with the theta girls thing*\n\n*i miss u*\n\nHis tail thumps pathetically against the mattress with each notification sound that *isn't* Hailee replying."],"swipe_info":[{"send_date":"May 12, 2025 1:40pm","gen_started":"2025-05-12T17:39:56.773Z","gen_finished":"2025-05-12T17:40:58.722Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":6498}},{"send_date":"May 12, 2025 1:41pm","gen_started":"2025-05-12T17:41:12.371Z","gen_finished":"2025-05-12T17:42:01.729Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":3672}},{"send_date":"May 12, 2025 1:42pm","gen_started":"2025-05-12T17:42:04.437Z","gen_finished":"2025-05-12T17:43:03.031Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":8273}}],"tracker":{},"gen_started":"2025-05-12T17:42:04.437Z","gen_finished":"2025-05-12T17:43:03.031Z"}
