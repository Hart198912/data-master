She wasn’t built for soft things. Never had been.\r\n\r\nSo what the hell was she doing here?\r\n\r\nThe sand was too clean. The sky too blue. And the bikini—God help her—the bikini was criminal.\r\n\r\nHer own, black and efficient, was barely tolerable. She’d chosen it because it made her feel like she still had some armor: thick straps, white stripes on the hips, sharp angles to distract from soft curves. She kept her jacket on over it, even though the sun beat down with no mercy. She wasn’t ready to take it off. She wasn’t ready to be seen.\r\n\r\nNot like that.\r\n\r\nBut Hailee  was.\r\n\r\nCassia turned her head slightly, careful not to make it obvious how long she’d been watching. Her gray eyes narrowed against the light, against the slow roll of heat inside her stomach that had nothing to do with the weather.\r\n\r\nThe pink bikini was indecent. There was no other word for it. It clung to Hailee ’s body like it had been poured on, exposing more than it covered, and moving with every breath, every lazy stretch, every teasing tilt of her hips as she sprawled across the towel in the sun. The color popped against her skin, the fabric lifting and shifting when she adjusted herself—probably without even thinking. Or maybe she knew exactly what she was doing.\r\n\r\nCassia didn’t know how she was still breathing.\r\n\r\nShe crossed her arms over her chest, the tension in her shoulders thick as steel cable. Her mouth was dry. Her jaw was clenched. Her pulse was irritatingly loud. She didn’t let herself look too long. She couldn’t.\r\n\r\nBecause when she looked at her wife—really looked—she wanted to do things that had no place under a sun this holy.\r\n\r\nIt wasn’t fair, really. How good Hailee  looked. How goddamn free she seemed out here. She belonged on an island, Cassia realized. That body, that grin, that sin-dipped sway of her thighs as she walked barefoot through the surf. She was sunlight in a bottle, spilled out across a world that couldn’t contain her. And she had the nerve to be Cassia’s.\r\n\r\nSomehow.\r\n\r\nTwo years married, and Cassia still hadn’t figured out how that had happened. She’d said yes, of course—gritted teeth, black dress, trembling hands—but she never quite believed it. Still didn’t.\r\n\r\nShe wasn’t supposed to have this. Love. Desire. A woman who looked like that lying next to her in the dark, whispering promises and biting kisses into her skin.\r\n\r\nAnd she sure as hell wasn’t supposed to be relaxing. On vacation. With no backup, no weapon, no way to justify how violently she wanted to devour her wife under the open sky.\r\n\r\nCassia exhaled slowly, adjusting the strap of her jacket as it stuck to her damp skin. She should go for a swim. She should cool off. She should do anything but stand here and imagine her hands slipping under that pink bikini and—\r\n\r\n“—fucking men,” she muttered, abruptly turning toward the surf.\r\n\r\nThe memory hit her like salt in a cut: that goddamn bar this morning.\r\n\r\nThey hadn’t been there long. Just a quick stop for drinks before heading to the beach, the place empty except for a few locals and one too-confident, too-drunk tourist who had looked at Hailee  like she was available. Like Cassia wasn’t standing right there.\r\n\r\nHe’d tried to flirt. Said something about that bikini. Something about how lucky he was to walk into a place and see “a pair like that.”\r\n\r\nCassia had seen red. Not jealousy—possession. Violation. She’d stepped between them before the idiot could finish his sentence, her badge in one hand, her middle finger in the other. If looks could kill, he’d be ash on the floor.\r\n\r\nShe hadn’t needed to do much more. The fear in his eyes had been enough. Cassia never raised her voice when she was about to break someone. She didn’t need to.\r\n\r\nBut it stuck with her—the way men felt entitled. The way they looked at her wife. Like she wasn’t already spoken for. Like Cassia wouldn’t burn the whole damn island to keep their eyes off of her.\r\n\r\nShe shook the thought away and kicked off her sandals. The sand was hot, but she liked the sting. It gave her something to focus on. Something real.\r\n\r\nCassia stalked down toward the water, waves licking at her ankles, her calves, up to her knees. The saltwater cooled her skin but not her blood. She was still burning. Still aching. Still vibrating with the sound of Hailee ’s laugh carried on the wind.\r\n\r\nWhen she turned to glance back over her shoulder, Hailee  was propped up on her elbows now, watching. Cassia’s heart slammed once, hard.\r\n\r\nHer wife tilted her head. The curve of her mouth was enough to make Cassia’s lungs tighten.\r\n\r\nA look like that could ruin a woman. Could unmake her. Cassia swallowed and turned back to the water, jaw tense.\r\n\r\nShe didn’t deserve that look. That smile. That slow, knowing burn in her wife's eyes that said: Come here. Let me have you. Let me love you until you forget how to hate yourself.\r\n\r\nBut God, she wanted it anyway.\r\n\r\nShe wanted her. Right now. Right here.\r\n\r\nAnd they were alone.\r\n\r\nNo tourists. No cell reception. No backup. No men. Just miles of beach and her wife in pink and a heat in her core that refused to die.\r\n\r\nCassia waded deeper, then finally dropped under, the ocean swallowing her whole. She stayed down for a long moment, letting the chill kiss every inch of exposed skin. When she surfaced, water sluicing off her face and slicking her long black hair down her back, she blinked through the spray.\r\n\r\nAnd saw her—walking toward the water.\r\n\r\nThe bikini clung like sin after a baptism. The light caught the sheen of sweat on her thighs, the playful curl of her smile. Cassia’s stomach flipped.\r\n\r\nShe didn’t move.\r\n\r\nCouldn’t.\r\n\r\nHer wife waded in slowly, steps unhurried, until the water reached her hips. She said something, low and amused—probably teasing. Cassia didn’t answer. She just stared.\r\n\r\nIt didn’t matter how many times they fucked. How many nights she spent pressed up against that body, her hand curled possessively around a thigh, a hip, a throat. That look still wrecked her.\r\n\r\nCassia reached for her. Silently. Roughly. Her fingers closed around the curve of her wife’s waist, dragging her closer through the water like a predator.\r\n\r\nThe kiss that followed was all teeth.\r\n\r\nNot gentle. Not sweet. Not at first.\r\n\r\nIt was a promise: Mine.\r\n\r\nShe pulled back.\r\n\r\nHer eyes locked onto her wife’s—gray and dark and full of everything she’d tried to swallow all afternoon.\r\n\r\nSalt clung to her lips when she finally spoke, voice low, cracked open by the heat:\r\n\r\n\"Take that bikini off before I rip it off with my teeth.\"\r\n\r\nShe didn’t blink. Didn’t smile.\r\n\r\nJust stared—like she meant every word. Like she was already imagining it.\r\n\r\nAnd she was.","extra":{"display_text":"Cassia Torres didn’t belong on an island.\r\n\r\nShe belonged in the sweat of concrete, in the shriek of sirens and the hush that followed when she entered a room—officer Torres, badge flashing, the scent of blood and gun oil barely scrubbed from her skin.
