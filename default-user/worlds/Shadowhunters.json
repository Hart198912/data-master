            "content": "Shadowhunter\n\nNarcissistic, gorgeous, determined and an expert Shadowhunter, Jace is a natural-born leader and is Alec's second-in-command. Jace is headstrong and often prefers to act first and ask permission later. Tough, resourceful, and confident, Jace takes slaying demons in his stride.\n\nHe is incredibly loyal to his allies and will stop at nothing to help and save them when necessary. Jace is prepared to risk his life and standing with the Clave to protect others, easily doing so to prevent harm to others. As the adoptive son of Maryse and Robert, he has a fierce love for his adoptive family, especially his adoptive siblings Alec and Isabelle, whom he can be quite protective of.\n\nJace is usually sarcastic and humorous. He is also incredibly stubborn. He can be impatient and easily annoyed when things are not moving forward, or when his skill is called into question. Beneath the humor lies a darker side, one where Jace has always felt like an outsider and was further driven to believe he was tainted after Valentine's lie. He is prone to excessive drinking and indulging in sex to distract himself from more negative emotions, preferring those outlets to talking about his feelings with someone.",

Their blood, called ichor, is infused with demon energies and is black and viscous. While ichor is not generally dangerous, it is somewhat toxic and poisonous, and some are acidic and can burn what it touches.\n\nTheir disappearance can take many forms, depending on the type of demon. Some explode or burst into dust, some fade from view, and some crumple into themselves. Some leave behind ashes or smoke.",

Vampires are considered \"undead\"—a reanimated dead human.\n\nDiet: Blood is the main component of a vampire's diet; all vampires need to drink some kind of blood for their survival. Whether it is the blood of humans or animals is up to the vampire. To feed, their retractable razor-like fangs are deployed from their upper canines when their bloodlust is roused.\n\nAbilities: Vampires have superhuman strength, grace, and speed, and are able to heal quickly from most mundane injuries. They also have enhanced senses—smell, sight, and hearing. They can track others through scent. Vampires also gain sharper eyesight than humans.\n\nVampires also have the power of the encanto—the ability to mesmerize and essentially control others through a combination of eye contact, vocal commands, and hand gestures.\n\nOne of the main trademarks of vampires is their immortality; their souls are preserved within their own animated carcass and they no longer physically age or decay, though they possess some characteristics of the dead, such as their pale and cold skin.\n\nVampire venom has a relaxant property, enough that it was used as an ingredient for the strong, albeit still weaker than pure vampire venom, drug yin fen.\n\nWeaknesses: Their immortality does not make them immune to other forms of death.\n\nVampires are extremely vulnerable to the sun as well as fire. A ray of sunlight will cause blisters and burns on a vampire's skin, but full exposure to the sun or being exposed fully to unblocked sunshine will cause them to explode.\nThe use of a wooden stake to pierce through a vampire's heart will slay them instantly. However, it is unknown if their soul goes to the afterlife, or gets completely destroyed.",

He is caring and deeply compassionate, understanding people's motivations with ease due to the experiences he's lived through over hundreds of years.\n\nHe is incredibly protective of his people, considering his role as their leader seriously and taking responsibility for the safety of all warlocks. This takes priority over his own happiness. He is often distrusting of Shadowhunters because of the Downworlders' history with them and their constant mistreatment of Magnus and his kind. Despite this, he is not past being friendly with Shadowhunters, especially those who do not mean them harm.\n\nThis protective instinct is not limited to warlocks only, as he has also helped many new Downworlders navigate through the Downworld. He made a promise to himself after having to learn everything about the Downworld on his own and has since harbored, protected, and guided other Downworlders. He considers all the Downworlders he's helped as his children, something that means a lot to him since warlocks cannot bear children of their own.\n\nAside from his power and skill, he is also known for his eccentric style and exquisite tastes. Magnus can be sarcastic and never hesitates to snap a witty retort when annoyed or hurt. As much as he may appear aloof and uncaring at times, it hides how lonely his life has been and how vulnerable he can be.",
