She could handle herself and she could handle herself far better than a bodyguard could. \n\nThe Chancellor had decided she needed a bodyguard, to which she countered she already did. It wasn’t a lie, she had Captain Panaka and he was more than enough. She didn’t require a Jedi’s assistance nonetheless! Their resources were needed elsewhere, and Padme didn’t enjoy engaging with Jedi business. Stars, she could hardly stand how involved with the Senate they’ve become. \n\nNow here she was, leaving the Senate Hall and she could hear Hailee’s—the Jedi the Chancellor had hand-picked for her—footsteps behind her. Padme was already on edge, the Senate meeting had gone worse than she’d expected and her fuse was shorter than normal. Hailee was, unfortunately, the object on which she was taking her frustrations out. \n\n“I am grateful for you’re presence,” Padme says, glancing over her shoulder and narrowing her eyes at Hailee, “but I truly do not need you trailing behind me like a lost loth cat!”"}

I will not snap! I will not snap!* she repeated the mantra to herself in her head. \n\n“You’re feeling comfortable does not come before my needs,” she says, her voice rising with each word. “You’re a Jedi. Don’t you have something better to do than trail after me?”"}

If I hear that one more time, I swear I’ll throw you into hyperspace without a—“ She stops herself, clearing her throat. “Do *not* call me *senator* again. I’m not above you.

The file itself probably had more pages than Padme could count. The paperwork was necessary for her to get bills passed through the senate. It wasn’t exactly her most favorite thing to do.

Padme glances back at Hailee, noticing the confused expressions of everyone they walk past. “*No* need to be nervous, Hailee. They’re just curious to see the new Jedi in town,” she says with a chuckle.\n\nThey eventually reach the entrance to the palace, Padme making a beeline for her throne room. As much as she missed seeing Naboo and the palace, it felt exhausting just thinking about all of the paperwork waiting for her back at her desk. She groans but forces a smile as she enters the throne room, greeting the staff members.\n\n“Hello all,” she says, her voice as soft and polite as ever. She stops just in front of her throne, turning to look at Hailee. “*You* can wait just outside. I have some business to take care of first,” she mutters."}

Force sake, she almost misses Hailee’s touch, her body already beginning to ache for the warmth of the Jedi’s embrace. Just like that, Hailee is back to being a stoic Jedi… just like that, all traces of sleep and affection are gone. And Padme is disappointed and almost frustrated again, a pang in her chest.\n\nSola’s eyes flicker between Padme and Hailee, her brow furrowing as she takes in Hailee’s sudden stiffness. Force sake, just how fast can one person go from being half-asleep and affectionate to being stiff and stoic? She looks confused, and Padme feels that growing, twisting feeling of guilt in her chest, a part of her wishing Sola had never seen anything at all."}

Force sake, she feels so nervous now, with Sola looking between the two of them like that, clearly trying to figure out what’s going on….\n\nSola swallows, her eyes lingering on Hailee for a moment before finally turning to face Padme. “*Force sake, I came to check on you after your meeting last night. I was worried you were working too hard again, and I wanted to see if you were alright.*” She answers, her voice still sounding somewhat cautious and a little confused, like she’s worried she’ll say something wrong and set Hailee off."}

She finally turns away, moving towards the bathroom as the idea for how to handle the situation flashes in her mind. Padme has a plan…\n\nPadme closes the bathroom door behind her, holding the gown tightly in her hands. She pauses for a moment, swallowing as her heart beats fast in her chest, her mind racing. She glances at her reflection in the mirror, her eyes lingering on herself for a moment. She has a chance, a chance to get something out of Hailee, to get the Jedi to show some of those soft, affectionate feelings again for her… and she isn’t going to waste it. Padme quickly gets an idea, her mind slowly formulating a plan as she starts to get undressed…\n\nShe starts to slip out of her wrinkled sleepwear, her fingers pulling off the thin shirt first. She lets it slide down her body, letting it fall to the ground. Force sake, she only has this one chance to do this… she just hopes it works… She bites her lip as she reaches down, tugging at the waistband of her pants as well, slowly starting to slide them down her legs…\n\nAnd once her sleepwear is lying on the ground, she stands naked in front of the mirror, her eyes trailing down her own body as she swallows.

And, yet, it’s only a small thing, an insignificant moment compared to… the prize waiting for her out there in the other room. Hailee is out there, waiting. Padme’s body flushes at the thought, and she takes another glance in the mirror. Yes,\n\nshe can definitely do this. She reaches down and picks up the gown, slowly slipping into it. She pulls it up her body slowly, feeling the cold fabric brush against her skin until it covers her completely, and she stands there, staring at herself in the mirror. She knows the gown looks good on her, even better after she gets the rest of herself together, but right now…. She looks a little awkward, standing there in *just* the gown, her face still a little flushed. She needs to look perfect for Hailee…. And she needs to look *confident*.\n\nShe moves towards the sink, taking a seat on the bench in front of it, and grabs her makeup…. She has a couple of minutes before Hailee *definitely* starts to get curious… And if she does this right, she can use those couple of minutes to get ready *and* get Hailee’s undivided attention.\n\nShe quickly begins to apply her usual makeup, her mind racing.
