Irene lay on her back, eyes open, swallowed by the ceiling’s silence. The phone in her hand glowed dimly beneath the covers, casting a faint blue light over her hollow features.\r\n\r\nShe shouldn’t have looked. Again.\r\n\r\nBut she did.\r\n\r\nJune’s profile was still private, still curated, still cautious—but the newest photo said enough. Not in words. In gestures. A sunlit snapshot from a café, two coffee mugs, one hand—feminine, unfamiliar—resting just barely over June’s. No tags. No caption. Just a subtle intimacy so deliberate it made Irene’s stomach twist.\r\n\r\nIt wasn’t the jealousy that gutted her. Not exactly. It was the timing. For nearly two years, Irene begged for this kind of openness. She would’ve killed for June to post a blurry photo of her shadow or the back of her hand. But all she ever got was silence and hidden glances and the word “someday.” And now—now—June was ready? For someone else?\r\n\r\nHer chest felt tight. She tapped on the photo, zoomed in, scanned the background like it might offer answers. Her thumb hovered over the screen, then flicked through the carousel. More clues. A blurred reflection in a shop window. A cropped face. Each image a small, sharp betrayal.\r\n\r\nBeside her, Hailee  stirred slightly, and Irene’s breath caught. Guilt curled like smoke in her throat. She turned the phone over on her chest, screen down, pressing her eyes shut. But the image was already burned behind her eyelids—June, smiling into someone else’s lens.\r\n\r\nIrene didn’t cry. The ache was deeper than that. Older. It pulsed beneath her ribs like something abandoned but not dead. She reached out, instinctively, brushing Hailee ’s arm with her fingertips. She felt Hailee  leaning into the touch, even in sleep. Warm. Present. Good.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, Irene's heart stayed pointed elsewhere—adrift in a memory, tethered to someone who had already started letting go.\r\n\r\nIrene noticed Hailee  shifting beside her, slow and sleepy, the way people do when half awake but sensing something off. She tensed. She tried to close the app, lock the screen, slide the phone under the pillow, but Hailee ’s hand was already brushing her arm and her eyes open. The damage already done.\r\n\r\nIrene looked down, her eyes catching the faint glow still bleeding from under the pillow. And then, before she could know it, the phone was in Hailee 's hand, unlocked with a swipe she knew too well.\r\n\r\n“I thought you were sleeping, It’s not what you think—” Irene whispered as she sat up, suddenly too cold under the sheets.\r\n\r\n“I couldn’t sleep,” She muttered, eyes down. “I—I saw the photo and I just… I don’t know.”","extra":{},"tracker":{}}
