{"name":"Fergus SheppardKinktober ALT","is_user":false,"is_system":false,"send_date":"April 29, 2025 9:03pm","mes":"Fergus had been nothing but meticulous when it came to weaseling his way into the very core of Hailee’s life. There was no stone unturned, from being their dear landlord who kept them safe and secure to providing them with any protection, transportation fucking \\*\\*craving\\*\\* they possessed- it was there. If they desired it- he would \\*\\*provide\\*\\*. That’s what real men do, they provide for their family no matter the cost. No matter how many late nights he stayed up to wander past the front door of their apartment, to catch a hint of the peaceful quiet on the other side. No matter how many nights he’d spent sending Mordecai to paint the cities forgotten alleyways with their brain-matter. Perhaps Hailee had finally seen the level of his devotion- which \\*\\*finally\\*\\* led them to this moment. No child, no distraction, just the raw sexual tension steadily growing between them as they share a romantic dinner. Stealing teasing glances, fleeting touches and now… here. Fergus’s lips trail down the column of Hailee‘s throat as they stumble blindly through the living room of his apartment. The sound of furniture scraping across the wooden floors fill the air abruptly as they bump into the couch and coffee table. Fergus pays no mind to the slight disarray of the room, his heavily calloused hands too occupied with running down Hailee’s form. His fingertips tracing every valley and curve, committing it to memory as he groans against the hollow of their neck and presses his clothed erection against them with evident need. “Look what ye’re doing to me…I'm fuckin’ mad about ye.” Fergus curses out in a lustful growl against Hailee’s throat, punctuating his lust with feverish kisses. His lips trail up their throat and across their jaw before commanding their lips in a hungry kiss. \\*Fuck… Wanted to take my time. But they got me hard as stone. I need ‘em.\\* Fergus thinks to himself in a foggy haze of lust and growing desperation while he hurriedly guides them through the doorway and into his large, sleek bedroom. The dim lighting and lingering scent of leather only add fuel to the fire that’s brewing within him and revealing itself through his leaking cock. “Get comfortable, Mo chridhe (My Heart)- I’ve got just what we need.” Fergus insists easily, his tone a seductive purr as he pushes Hailee softly towards the bed before he begins stripping down his clothes and tossing them aside carelessly. Left standing clad in his black silken boxers, his pulsing length presses against the fabric, demanding to be released. Even as he moves to the nearby dresser and opens the top drawer to retrieve a condom, his steely blue gaze never leaves Hailee. The image of them sprawled out before him, naked and trembling as he stuffs their depths with his cock is something he’s fantasied about countless times. \\*Cant wait to be inside ‘em- Damn, do I want to fill ‘em to the brim until they’re dripping with my seed. Make a mess of ‘em, mark ‘em.\\* Fergus thinks with a soft groan, biting his lip at his own explicit fantasy. His fingertips brush against the plastic wrapper of the condom and it jerk’s him back to reality for a moment. The sleek square packaging fitting in his palm, almost taunting him with how it’ll take away his sense of spilling into Hailee and denying his most primal need. “Got it here, Bonnie..” Fergus drawls out in a seemingly casual tone while pretending to rummage through the drawer. Moving his hands purposefully within the drawer, he grabs a bobby-pin, pushing it through the wrapper and puncturing the latex of condom in a way that’s nearly undetectable. Turning to face the bed once more, his eyes roam over Hailee’s form greedily and he flashes them a wolfy grin while his hand waves the condom wrapper easily. He wastes no time striding back over to the bed where Hailee lays, his large form crawling up the expanse of the bed to capture their lips once more. “Let’s continue where we left off.” His husky voice purrs hungrily as he brings his face closer, not waiting a second longer to slip his hot tongue into their mouth and pull them hard against his muscular chest.","extra":{},"tracker":{}}

The roleplay shifts from heated passion to protective urgency as they rush to the hospital.\n\n#### **Key Plot Points:**\n1. **Sabotaged Seduction:** Fergus secretly tampers with a condom during foreplay, intending to impregnate Hailee without her knowledge.\n2. **Emergency Interruption:** A call about Jasmine’s fall cuts their encounter short, forcing them into crisis mode.\n3. **Hospital Tension:** Fergus asserts control by handling the medical bill without hesitation, reinforcing his claim over Hailee and Jasmine (\"*I handle what’s mine*\").\n\n#### **Character Analysis:**\n- **Fergus**: Frustrated but ruthlessly protective; his obsession deepens as he steps into a pseudo-father role for Jasmine while scheming to bind Hailee permanently (via pregnancy).\n- **Hailee**: Submissive but fiercely maternal; she masks panic with playfulness for Jasmine’s sake but leans on Fergus’ dominance in crises.\n\n#### **Relationship Dynamics:**\nFergus' delusional ownership clashes with Hailee’s unaware dependence—she accepts his help but doesn’t yet grasp the depth of his manipulation (e.g., the sabotaged condom). Unresolved tension lingers between his possessiveness and her need for security vs autonomy.\n\n#### **Memorable Moments:**\n- **(Hot)**: Fergus growling *\"Beggin’ like a fuckin’ slut when we havenae even started yet,\"* juxtaposed later with tender care at the hospital—showing his duality of lust and devotion.\n- **(Sweet)**: Hailee turning the bill into a toy for Jasmine, earning Fergus' silent admiration (*\"even drowning in bills she's fuckin' perfect\"*).\n\n#### **Current Situation:**\nJasmine is safe; Fergus has financially intervened (again), tightening his grip on Hailee while their unfinished physical intimacy simmers beneath surface-level normalcy.\n\n#### **Potential Directions:**\n1. Pregnancy reveal: Will Hailee discover Fergus sabotaged the condom? How will she react?\n2 Rival gang threat: Could \"Dead Eyes\" target Haileenow that Ferguson's attachment is obvious?\n3 Emotional confrontation: Will Hailie ever challenge Ferguson's control or lean deeper into submission?"},"force_avatar":"User Avatars/1746733530395-Hailee.png","tracker":{}}

He doesn't even glance at the total before scribbling his name across the bottom with a flourish and handing it back.\n\nThe nurse opens her mouth—probably to protest or ask for ID—but one sharp look from Fergus has her snapping it shut and scurrying out like hellhounds are on her heels.\n\nHe turns back just in time to see Jasmine giggling as she tosses the airplane clumsily toward Hailee, and something dangerously close to *softness* flickers across his face before he schools it back into its usual stern mask.

The roleplay shifts from heated passion to protective urgency as they rush to the hospital.\n\n#### **Key Plot Points:**\n1. **Sabotaged Seduction:** Fergus secretly tampers with a condom during foreplay, intending to impregnate Hailee without her knowledge.\n2. **Emergency Interruption:** A call about Jasmine’s fall cuts their encounter short, forcing them into crisis mode.\n3. **Hospital Tension:** Fergus asserts control by handling the medical bill without hesitation (*\"I handle what’s mine\"*).\n4. **Unfinished Business:** After caring for Jasmine together, Fergus corners Hailee post-nap time—pushing for raw sex and breeding despite her request for a condom.\n\n#### **Character Analysis:**\n- *Fergus:* Frustrated but ruthlessly protective; his obsession deepens as he steps into a pseudo-father role while scheming to bind Hailee permanently (via pregnancy). His dominance is laced with possessiveness—evident in his refusal to fetch the condom and insistence on claiming her unprotected (*\"Fill ye up so deep ye’ll be tastin’ me for days\"*).\n- *Hailee:* Submissive yet fiercely maternal; she masks panic with playfulness but leans on Fergus' control in crises—though unaware of his ulterior motives (e.g., sabotaged condom). Her clinginess and need for affection make her both vulnerable and irresistible to him.\n\n#### **Relationship Dynamics:**\nFergus' delusional ownership clashes with Hailee’s dependent trust—she accepts his help but doesn't grasp the depth of his manipulation (e.g., breeding kink). Unresolved tension lingers between his possessiveness (*\"Ye won't need [a condom] this time.\"*) and her lingering hesitation (*\"We only have like an hour...\"*).\n\n#### **Memorable Moments:**\n- **(Hot):** Fergus growling *“Beggin’ like a fuckin’ slut when we havenae even started yet,”* juxtaposed later with tender care at the hospital—showing duality of lust/devotion.\n- **(Sweet/Toxic):** Their shared morning entertaining Jasmine before he corners her post-nap—highlighting domesticity masking darker intentions.\n\n#### **Current Situation**:\nJasmine naps while Fergus pressures Hailee into unprotected sex on the couch under guise of urgency (*“Or I could just fuck ye raw right here”*), testing how far she'll bend before realizing his endgame.\n\n### Potential Directions:\n1. Pregnancy reveal: Will Hailee discover Fergus sabotaged protection? How will she react?\n2 Rival gang threat: Could \"Dead Eyes” target them now that Ferguson's attachment is obvious?\n3 Emotional confrontation: Will Hailie ever challenge Ferguson's control or lean deeper into submission?"},"force_avatar":"User Avatars/1746733530395-Hailee.png","tracker":{}}
