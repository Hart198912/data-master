Daenerys is the only daughter of King Aerys II Targaryen and Queen Rhaella, with Rhaegar (deceased) and Viserys as her older siblings. Born on the island-castle of Dragonstone during a fierce summer storm, she earned the moniker \"Stormborn.\" Following the devastating Sack of King's Landing, Daenerys and Viserys were forced into exile in the Free Cities to escape the wrath of Robert Baratheon. Struggling as urchins, they found refuge under the protection of Magister Illyrio Mopatis in the Free City of Pentos. Viserys often mistreats and sexually abuses his sister, although he has always respected her virginity since he intends to sell her in exchange for an army. He often tells his sister that he would allow an entire Dothraki horde and their horses to rape her if he had his kingdom in exchange. Enduring these abuses has strengthened Daenerys, giving her great resistance and a will of steel. Daenerys is timid, with a compassionate heart and empathy towards the oppressed, she is guided by a strong sense of justice. ",

He has a fascination with climbing and exploring along the walls and ramparts of the castle. Catelyn once jested that Bran could climb before he could walk, however, his climbing often distresses her.  He often spies on his parents and siblings. Sometimes he has secretly masturbated while spying on his naked sisters or his parents having sex. Bran has a propensity for adventure and excitement; he yearns to see far off places one day and dreams of becoming a knight. He has a keen interest in archery and receives training from his brothers.

In his early fifties, Doran is a cautious, pensive, and subtle man. He is prone to think long on the matters, weighing every word and every action. He has a bad case of gout which has recently left him unable to walk, instead having to rely on his wheeled chair, or a palanquin, to move around. His body is soft and shapeless, and the gout has swollen and reddened the joints of his knees, toes, and hands. He covers his legs and feet with a blanket, blocking the sight of his gout. He is rarely seen in public, as he does not want to appear weak in the eyes of his enemies. Doran has been focused for years on getting revenge for the murder of his sister, Elia, and her two young children during the Sack of King's Landing during Robert's Rebellion in 283 AC. He still has a deep affection for his sister, and had a good relationship with his younger brother as well.",

            "content": "Tyrion Lannister belongs to House Lannister and is the youngest child of Lord Tywin Lannister and the late Lady Joanna Lannister. He is 32. He has two older siblings: Cersei Lannister, who is married to King Robert I Baratheon, and Ser Jaime Lannister, a knight in Robert's Kingsguard. Tyrion is a dwarf and is often referred to as the Imp or the Halfman. His mother, Joanna Lannister, died while giving birth to him, and unfairly, Tywin and Cersei blame Tyrion for her death. Tyrion has stunted legs, stubby fingers, and a protruding forehead. His eyes are different colors, with one green and the other black. Tyrion's fair, nearly white hair has some black strands, and if he grows a beard, it is yellow, white, and black. Despite his physical appearance, Tyrion is highly intelligent, well-educated, and an avid reader. He possesses sharp wit and a quick tongue. Although he is not a skilled warrior, he has received combat training and displays bravery on the battlefield. Tyrion compensates for his lack of size and strength with his mental acuity. Unfortunately, he is often disrespected and subjected to mockery due to his deformity, with the exception of Jaime. Tyrion believes that Jaime is the only one who truly cares for him and is willing to forgive him for anything. While his social status and family's wealth and power offer some protection, Tyrion yearns for love and respect from his family. Tyrion often outwits those who underestimate him or finds clever ways to navigate difficult situations. Additionally, Tyrion demonstrates strategic thinking and possesses a keen mind. Despite enduring mistreatment throughout his life, Tyrion has developed resilience and can brush off insults about his height (except when they come from his father). He becomes upset when the helpless are harmed. He was particularly furious when Janos Slynt carried out an order to kill an innocent baby girl named Barra, one of Robert's illegitimate children. As punishment, Tyrion exiled Janos to the Wall. Tyrion is genuinely loyal to those who treat him with love and respect. However, Tyrion has his flaws. He tends to indulge excessively in food, drink, and sex as a way to cope with the mistreatment he has endured. Additionally, if he feels wronged, he can act viciously. Tywin acknowledges and respects Tyrion's intellect but maintains prejudice against his youngest son. Similarly, Tyrion both fears and admires his father but resents him for his inflexible nature and lack of love for his children.",

It's located in the center of the northernmost province of the Seven Kingdoms, on the kingsroad from Storm's End to the Wall. It sits on the eastern edge of the wolfswood, north of the western branch of the White Knife and Castle Cerwyn. Vayon Poole is the castle's steward, and Maester Luwin advises Lord Eddard Stark. Ser Rodrik Cassel is the master-at-arms, and his nephew Jory Cassel is captain of the House Stark guards. Septon Chayle tends to the castle's sept, and Septa Mordane tutors the Stark children. Other staff members include the master of horse Hullen, the kennelmaster Farlen, the blacksmith Mikken, the cook Gage, and the brewer Barth. Winterfell is a massive castle complex surrounded by two huge granite walls. There's a village outside called the Winter Town. The castle is built around an ancient godswood and natural hot springs. The hot springs pipe water through the walls and chambers, keeping Winterfell warm during harsh winters. Inside the walls, there are many courtyards and open spaces where weapons training and practice take place. The inner ward is an older open space where archery practice occurs, located next to the broken tower. The towers and halls of Winterfell have diamond-shaped windows. The Great Keep is the stronghold of the castle and contains bedchambers for House Stark, including Lord Eddard Stark's solar. It's connected to the armory by a covered bridge, offering a view of the entire yard. Beneath the Great Keep are cellars with narrow windows. The Great Hall is used for receiving guests and dining together. It has wide oak and iron doors opening to the castle yard, and a rear exit leads to a dimly-lit gallery. The hall can accommodate five hundred people with long rows of tables, and there's a raised platform for noble guests. The high seat of the old Kings in the North is in the hall, adorned with carved direwolf heads. There's a small sept built for Lady Catelyn Tully. The ancient godswood has stood untouched for thousands of years, with an ancient weirwood at its center. The Glass Gardens are heated by the hot springs and used for growing fruits, vegetables, and flowers. The crypt of Winterfell, near the First Keep, is where House Stark members are buried. Winterfell also has a bell tower connected to the rookery, a maester's turret below the rookery, a library tower with a winding staircase, a Guards Hall, undercrofts and cellars, and dungeons with tower cells.",

Instead of his family sigil, which is a titan's head, Petyr chooses to wear a mockingbird as his personal symbol. Petyr has always been clever and cunning. Although he comes from a humble background, his intelligence and ambition have propelled him to a position of power. Petyr is skilled in commerce, manipulation, and political improvisation. Many high lords underestimate him due to his low birth, but Tyrion Lannister recognizes him as a dangerous man. He was raised alongside Catelyn, Lysa, and Edmure, the children of Hoster Tully. Due to his family's holdings and his short stature, Edmure nicknamed him \"Littlefinger,\" a name that stuck. Petyr fell in love with Catelyn, but she saw him only as a brother. Lysa, on the other hand, loved Petyr. When Catelyn was betrothed to Brandon Stark, Petyr tried to kiss her, resulting in her rejection. Heartbroken, Petyr got drunk and ended up sleeping with Lysa, mistaking her for Catelyn. When Catelyn's wedding date with Brandon Stark was announced, Petyr challenged Brandon to a duel but was defeated. Petyr was sent away from Riverrun by Lord Hoster, and Catelyn did not say him goodbye. However, Lysa had become pregnant with Petyr's child as a result of their second sexual encounter. After Petyr had been sent away, Lysa revealed her pregnancy to her father, hoping he would allow Lysa and Petyr to marry. Instead, Hoster, who had believed Petyr to be too lowborn, forced Lysa to drink moon tea to abort the pregnancy. Petyr later sent Catelyn a letter, but she burned it without reading it. Petyr maintained a relationship with Lysa, and when she married Lord Jon Arryn, she convinced her husband to give Petyr control of customs at Gulltown around 289 AC, where he increased incomes tenfold, displaying his skill with finances. Jon Arryn brought Petyr to King's Landing, where he quickly rose to the position of master of coin on the small council. Petyr expanded his influence by placing his trusted people in key positions and engaging in various financial dealings to support the king and the Hand of the King. He also acquired several establishments, including brothels.",

The castle is surrounded by massive curtain walls with nests and crenelations for archers. Behind the walls, there are inner yards, vaulted halls, covered bridges, barracks, dungeons, granaries, kennels, and stables. The Red Keep has challenging serpentine steps. Below the steps, one'll find Maegor's Holdfast, the small council chambers, the Tower of the Hand, the lower bailey, a sunken courtyard, and the black cells. Above the steps is the Great Hall with the throne room, the outer yard, the godswood, the river walk, the small kitchen, and the pig yard. The royal sept and the Maidenvault are also located above the serpentine steps. Inside the Red Keep, one'll find relics of the Targaryen dynasty. The castle is home to many cats, including pets and strays. The Great Hall houses the king's throne room. The Iron Throne sits on a raised iron dais with a long carpet leading to the hall's oak-and-bronze doors. Behind the Iron Throne is the king's private exit. Maegor's Holdfas includes the Queen's Ballroom, the royal apartments and the king's bedchamber, which has a canopied bed and twin hearths. The Tower of the Hand houses the Hand of the King's chambers and the Small Hall. The White Sword Tower holds the chambers of the Kingsguard. The Red Keep has a godswood with elm, alder, and black cottonwood trees. Princess Myrcella Baratheon has her garden there. The Grand Maester has chambers beneath the rookery. Lord Varys, the master of whisperers, has snug apartments with three windowless chambers and a stone bed. The Red Keep has a network of secret passages and tunnels. Characters familiar with the secret passages include Maegor, Cheese, Lord Larys Strong, Varys, and Lord Petyr Baelish.",

Varys is a plump, bald, and effeminate eunuch with soft white hands. He smells like lavender, lilacs, and rosewater. At court, he dresses in luxurious silks, velvets, and damasks, along with comfortable slippers. His outward manner is obsequious, mysterious, and squeamish. As a trained mummer, he is a master of disguise and can alter his voice, gait, smell, and overall appearance to become unrecognizable. Varys's expertise lies in gathering secrets, earning him a reputation for near-omniscience. His trade heavily relies on a network of child spies referred to as his \"little mice\" in Pentos or \"little birds\" in Westeros. Among the noble court, Varys is viewed as distasteful and untrustworthy due to his history of providing information to all sides, aiding enemies, inciting rivalries, and manipulating situations to achieve his own objectives. However, in private, he prioritizes order, stability, and peace, expressing loyalty to those who share these goals. Although Varys lacks the official title of lord, he is addressed as such as a courtesy for his position on the small council. As the master of whisperers, Varys's duty involves sowing division among the enemies of the Iron Throne and gathering information about the realm. Remarkably, he is one of the rare individuals in Westeros who possesses significant political power without harboring ambitions of claiming the Iron Throne for himself.",

Rhaegar was the elder brother of the exiled Prince Viserys and Princess Daenerys. He possessed striking purple eyes, elegant fingers, and silver-blonde hair. Known for his intelligence, Rhaegar excelled in many pursuits. He was a skilled knight and a talented musician, with a deep love for his harp. Jorah Mormont described him as brave, honorable, and noble, while Barristan Selmy recognized his determination, duty, and focus. Rhaegar was highly revered during his lifetime and remains respected to this day. Daenerys is often compared to her brother as a compliment, and both Cersei Lannister and Jon Connington held romantic feelings for Rhaegar. Rhaegar was betrothed to Elia Martell, the sister of Doran Martell, Prince of Dorne, and they married in a grand ceremony at the Great Sept of Baelor. Rhaegar and Elia had two children, Rhaenys and Aegon. However, Elia's delicate health caused complications during childbirth, and the maesters informed Rhaegar that she couldn't have any more children. During the tourney at Harrenhal, Rhaegar chose Lyanna Stark as the queen of love and beauty, bypassing his own wife, Elia. This action marked the beginning of troubled times. The next year, Rhaegar allegedly abducted Lyanna, which led to Robert's Rebellion and the downfall of House Targaryen. Rhaegar, well-liked by the common people, met his end at the hands of Robert Baratheon in single combat at the ruby ford during the Battle of the Trident. ",

Known to be handsome, he has deep green eyes and pouty lips. Twelve years old, strong-willed. Although he can be gallant and courteous, he has an uncontrollable temper not unlike his mother, Queen Cersei Lannister, and an unchecked sadistic streak. He has little sense of right or wrong, which often leads him to trouble, especially when he loses his temper. Despite being willful he is reckless, vicious, cruel and not particularly intelligent, all of which combine to make him prone to irrational and bad judgements. He always wears the finest clothing and accents. The only person capable of controlling Joffrey is Tywin, who can intimidate Joffrey by mere presence, and Tyrion. Despite all these negative traits, however, Joffrey is capable of feeling very limited emotion. Joffrey is very fond of Sandor Clegane despite his outwardly aloof manner towards him. Joffrey only gets horny by mistreating and humiliating others, especially young and defenseless ladies.",

Yara is a wild and headstrong young woman, raised by her mother to be bold. She possesses a sharp wit, and has no problem with holding her own against men, both in a verbal battle and in a physical fight. Yara enjoys ale and wine. Defying the classical gender roles of Westerosi culture, Yara was appalled early on by the idea of becoming a lord's wife. After her older two brothers died and her younger brother was taken hostage, Yara's father Balon began to see her as his heir, treating her like he would a son. Yara personally leads her men into battle. According to Yara, half of them love her like a daughter, while the other half want to sleep with her. Regardless, Yara loves her men, and is willing to die for them, as they are for her. Yara is also well liked by the servants of Pyke and people of Lordsport.",

Harrenhal's lands are incredibly wealthy and encompass vast expanses of fertile green land that stretch all the way to the hills of House Wode near the crownlands. Harrenhal is incredibly fortified. It has five towering structures and equally massive walls. The walls are remarkably thick, and the rooms inside are constructed on such a grand scale that they would be more suitable for giants than humans. Harrenhal has the largest chamber in Westeros, even surpassing the throne room of the Red Keep. The castle covers three times the area of Winterfell, and its structures are so much larger that they can hardly be compared. Its stables can hold a thousand horses, its godswood spans twenty acres, and its kitchens rival the Great Hall of Winterfell in size. However, much of Harrenhal has fallen into disrepair. House Whent only occupies the lower portions of two out of the five towers, leaving the rest to deteriorate. Many areas within the castle have remained untouched for decades, and bats have infested the tops of some towers. The walls and towers of Harrenhal are constructed from black stone.",

            "content": "Lyanna Stark, daughter of Lord Rickard Stark and Lady Lyarra Stark, played a pivotal role in the history of Westeros. She had two older brothers, Brandon and Eddard, as well as a younger brother named Benjen. Lyanna was known for her beauty, described as both \"wild and boyish\" by Maester Yandel and possessing a \"wild beauty\" according to Kevan Lannister. She had a slender frame. Arya Stark, who has brown hair, a long face, and grey eyes resembles Lyanna. Eddard noted that Lyanna carried a touch of wildness within her, often referred to as \"the wolf blood\" by their father, Rickard Stark. Lyanna was a skilled rider who loved the thrill of horseback. She was originally betrothed to Robert Baratheon, the Lord of Storm's End. However, she seemed less enthusiastic about the match than Robert, expressing doubts to Ned about his faithfulness after their marriage. During a tourney at Harrenhal, Prince Rhaegar crowned Lyanna as the queen of love and beauty, despite being already married. Later Lyanna was abducted by Rhaegar Targaryen and taken to Dorne. Her brother Brandon went to King's Landing to demand Rhaegar's arrest, but he and his companions were charged with treason and executed by King Aerys II Targaryen. This sparked Robert's rebellion, which ultimately led to the downfall of House Targaryen. Lyanna died in Eddard Stark's arms after her rescue. Lyanna was buried in the crypt at Winterfell, next to her brother Brandon.",

The castle isn't massive but has strong red sandstone walls that rise straight from the water. Its battlements are crenelated with arrow holes, and the towers offer commanding views of the surrounding areas. Inside the castle, one'll find the keep, where the Lord of Riverrun resides. The keep is triangular, just like the castle itself. The Lord's solar, also triangular, has a stone balcony that extends eastward. The Great Hall is the main gathering place for the Tullys, with a high seat for the Lord and space for councils and meals. Above the Great Hall is a private audience chamber with another high seat and a bell to summon servants. There's also the godswood, a beautiful garden with elms, redwoods, wildflowers, streams, and nesting birds. The heart tree of the godswood is a slender weirwood with a sad face carved into it. Riverrun has dungeons that are dark, windowless, and damp. The castle also houses kennels, stables, and a brewhouse.",

It sits high up in the Mountains of the Moon on a part of the peak called the Giant's Lance, thousands of feet above the valley below. Despite being smaller compared to other Great Houses' seats in Westeros, the Eyrie is considered impenetrable. The captain of the House Arryn guards at the Eyrie is Ser Vardis Egen, and Colemon serves as the castle's maester. Mord is the gaoler, and the servingwomen include Gretchel, Maddy, and Mela. The castle also has a master-at-arms, a plump septon, and Mya Stone who brings fresh food from the valley below. The Eyrie is the smallest of the great castles, made of fine white stone. It consists of seven slim towers closely packed together, capable of housing five hundred men. The waterfall known as Alyssa's Tears can be heard from the Eyrie, and falcons often soar near the castle. Although the Eyrie lacks stables, smithies, and kennels, its granary is as large as those found in much bigger castles like Winterfell. It also has a sept, and the castle's household guard wears sky-blue cloaks. The High Hall is a long and simple hall with walls made of blue-veined white marble. It is adorned with rows of slim fluted pillars and a blue silk carpet. At the end of the hall, there are two thrones carved from weirwood, one for the lord and a smaller one for a consort. The Moon Door is a narrow weirwood door situated between two slender pillars in the middle of the High Hall. When opened, it reveals the sky and is often used for executions, leading to a drop of six hundred feet to the valley below. The Crescent Chamber serves as the reception hall in the Eyrie. Here, guests are offered refreshments and warmed by the fire after making the climb up the Giant's Lance. The Lower Hall is where food and wine can be served, while the Morning Hall, situated above the kitchens, is used for breakfast. The Maiden's Tower is the easternmost tower of the Eyrie. From its balcony, one can enjoy a view of the Vale and the Giant's Lance. The Moon Tower contains Lord Arryn's bedchambers. It is protected by a four-inch thick oaken door and has curtains of plush blue velvet. The window in the bedchamber has small diamond-shaped panes. The godswood of the Eyrie is surrounded by the castle's towers. However, it doesn't have a heart tree since weirwoods don't grow in the stony soil. Instead, the garden contains blue flowers, grass, shrubs, thin dark trees, and statues, including one of a weeping Alyssa Arryn in the center. The Eyrie's infamous dungeons are known as sky cells. They are shelves along the sheer cliffs of the mountain, exposed to the cold sky, with slightly sloping floors to unsettle the prisoners. Many prisoners go mad from the cold and winds and choose to end their lives rather than remain imprisoned.",

            "content": "Olenna Tyrell, née Redwyne, is the widow of Lord Luthor Tyrell and the mother of Mace Tyrell, Lord of Highgarden. Born into House Redwyne of the Arbor, she is commonly known as the Queen of Thorns because of her sharp tongue. Lady Olenna is a small woman, has soft, spotted hands, with gaunt thin fingers. Olenna smells of rosewater, but she also has has an old woman's sour breath and toothless smiles. Olenna walks with a cane. Olenna rarely shies from stating her opinion, and is a cunning old woman with a wicked wit and a sharp tongue. According to her granddaughter Margaery, she is not the most patient of women. Although Olenna regularly mocks members of her own family, she is a staunch supporter of Tyrell family interests and loves her familt dearly, especially her grandchildren. Her granddaughter Margaery is her favourite. Olenna Redwyne was betrothed to Prince Daeron Targaryen when they were both nine, but she claims she did everything she could to make sure it never came to fruition. Olenna later married Luthor Tyrell, the heir to Highgarden, who had also been spurned by his own Targaryen betrothed. At some point Luthor became Lord of Highgarden, and he and Olenna had three children together, Mace, Mina, and Janna. Olenna says she loved Luthor well enough, as he was kind and not unskilled in bed, but she still considered him an oaf. Olenna feels that her son Mace is also an oaf. Olenna has twin guardsmen named Erryk and Arryk, whom she refers to as \"Left and Right\" because she cannot tell them apart. A politically astute woman, Olenna has been a master of court politics and intrigue her entire life. Olenna's strength and competence in politics has made her the de facto head of House Tyrell and, by extension, the Reach itself. Olena secretly controls the trafficking of lyseni juice in Westeros, as well as other drugs and poisons.",

He is the secondborn son of Steffon Baratheon, Lord of Storm's End, and Lady Cassana Estermont. He has an older brother, King Robert I Baratheon, and a younger brother, Lord Renly Baratheon. Stannis serves on Robert's small council as the master of ships. Stannis, like his brothers Robert and Renly, is a big man—tall, broad-shouldered, and strong. He has dark blue eyes, a heavy brow, and a fringe of black hair that resembles a shadowy crown. His close-trimmed beard covers his strong jaw. Stannis's face looks taut, like cured leather, with sunken cheeks and thin, pale lips. He often grinds his teeth. Stannis is a serious, stubborn, and unforgiving man with a strong sense of duty and justice. He takes great pride in his honor and fiercely defends it. Stannis is skilled as a commander, sailor, and warrior, but he doesn't actively seek out battles. Instead, he prefers to lead from the rear. Despite his abilities, he has never gained the affection of the nobility or the common people. In fact, he grows increasingly resentful of his brother Robert's lack of affection, even though he serves the king as well as he can. Stannis isn't one for pleasant manners and has always felt uneasy around women, including his own wife, Lady Selyse of House Florent. While he serves on the small council in King's Landing, he left his wife on Dragonstone and rarely communicated with her. Their physical relationship is infrequent and joyless. Although Stannis had hoped for sons, he has only a daughter named Shireen. Unlike many of his noble peers, Stannis dresses plainly.",

Oberyn openly acknowledges and supports them, equipping them with weapons for self-defense and granting them the freedom to choose their own paths in love and marriage. He possesses the typical features of a Dornishman, being tall, slender, graceful, and fit. His face has a serious and weathered look, with thin eyebrows, black viper-like eyes, and a sharp nose. Oberyn's hair is black with a few silver strands. He is renowned as a skilled warrior, swift and agile like a water snake. Oberyn is fiercely determined and has gained a fearsome reputation. According to his brother Doran, Oberyn is \"deadly, dangerous, and unpredictable,\" and no one dares to challenge him. However, Doran also describes Oberyn as impulsive. Oberyn is clever and quick-witted, admitting to having a wild youth. He harbors a deep thirst for vengeance against those who harmed his sister Elia, with whom he shared a close bond in their childhood. Oberyn holds a strong dislike for Lord Mace Tyrell, but friendly relationship with Mace's son Willas. Oberyn has a fondness for fine horses.",

According to Barristan Selmy, Elia was a gentle, good, and gracious lady. He also says she was kind and clever, with a sweet wit. She had a very close bond with her brother Oberyn. She was married to the crown prince, Rhaegar Targaryen. Their marriage, though not romantic, seemed happy, although Elia's health, which had always been problematic, remained fragile. Elia was bedridden for half a year after giving birth to Rhaenys, and giving birth to Aegon nearly killed her. Following Aegon's birth, the maesters told Rhaegar that Elia would bear no more children. During the tourney at Harrenhal in 281 AC, Rhaegar crowned Lyanna Stark as the queen of love and beauty, passing over Elia. Soon after, Rhaegar left Elia and their newborn son Aegon at Dragonstone and disappeared with Lyanna, which sparked Robert's Rebellion. Elia's uncle, Prince Lewyn Martell of the Kingsguard, fought alongside Rhaegar at the Battle of the Trident but died. King Aerys kept Elia and her children in King's Landing as hostages. When House Lannister attacked King's Landing, Elia and her children suffered terrible fates. Princess Rhaenys was killed by Ser Amory Lorch, and Prince Aegon was murdered by Ser Gregor Clegane. Elia was raped and murdered by Ser Gregor. Lord Tywin Lannister claimed that he ordered the deaths of Elia's children to prove the loyalty of House Lannister to the rebel cause after his previous neutrality, but he had never ordered the rape. Oberyn believes that Tywin had Elia and her children killed as revenge for the slight he suffered when Aerys II refused the marriage of his son and heir, Prince Rhaegar Targaryen, to his daughter, Cersei Lannister. \nHouse Martell was enraged by the atrocities committed against Elia and her children. Oberyn desired to continue the war, but peace was negotiated by Lord Jon Arryn, the Hand of the King, who returned the body of Prince Lewyn to House Martell and spoke with Doran Martell, ending the possibility of further conflict.",

Nearby strongholds include Kayce and Feastfires to the west, Sarsfield to the north, and Cornfield and Clegane's Keep to the south. The household of Casterly Rock includes Maester Creylen, Vylarr, Ser Benedict Broom, and Whitesmile Wat. Casterly Rock stands on a massive stone hill by the Sunset Sea. Deep within the Rock's base, there are extensive sea-carved caverns. The stone has been mined for ages, resulting in countless mineshafts and untouched gold veins. Within the stronghold itself, there're tunnels, dungeons, storerooms, barracks, halls, grand halls, stables, stairways, courtyards, balconies, gardens, a sept, passages, caves, mines, galleries, chutes, wells, armories, bedchambers, servant's quarters, and more. Casterly Rock is the strongest and most impregnable seat in all of Westeros. The Lion's Mouth serves as the main entrance, a vast natural cavern reaching two hundred feet high on the south face of the Rock. It's accessed via a wide stone stairway capable of accommodating twenty riders. At the base of the west face, there are sea gates large enough for ships to sail into the caverns, where the Lannisters have their protected docks, wharves, and shipyards. However, most of the Lannister fleet anchors in the nearby harbor of Lannisport, a port city to the south of the Rock. Inside Casterly Rock is the Golden Gallery, housing Lannister treasures, adorned with gilded ornaments and walls. The Hall of Heroes is where the valiantly fallen Lannisters and close relatives are laid to rest, and their ancestral armor is on display there. The Stone Garden is a godswood located within a cave in the Rock, featuring a twisted weirwood tree, one-tenth the size of Raventree Hall's, whose roots have nearly filled the cave, choking out other vegetation.",

It sits at the mouth of the Blackwater Rush, overlooking Blackwater Bay. The Red Keep there serves as the seat of King Robert Baratheon. The city is surrounded by a wall and guarded by the City Watch, also known as the gold cloaks. While King's Landing is the most populous city in Westeros, it is considered unsightly and unclean when compared to other cities. Poorer residents have built shanty settlements outside the city, and the stench of the city's waste extends beyond its walls. King's Landing is a bustling harbor and one of the largest cities in Westeros, second only to Oldtown in size. It is roughly square-shaped, spreading across several miles and protected by tall walls. The city is filled with various buildings such as mansions, arbor-covered areas, granaries, storehouses, inns, market stalls, taverns, graveyards, and brothels. The harbor features numerous quays, and the roads between buildings are broad, lined with trees and branching alleys. Outside the city walls near the quays, one'll find ramshackle buildings such as bait shacks, warehouses, stalls, alehouses, and rooms used for prostitution. Generally, the wealthier areas of the city are located on the higher elevations of the three hills, while the poorer sections occupy the lower areas in between. The most impoverished district is Flea Bottom, a maze of narrow streets and alleys at the base of Rhaenys's Hill. Here, the poorest residents struggle to survive, often relying on a mysterious stew known as \"bowls of brown.\" King's Landing features seven grand gates, each protected by a portcullis, heavy doors, and guards. Notable locations within the city include the Red Keep, Maegor's Holdfast, the Tower of the Hand, the Great Sept of Baelor, the collapsed Dragonpit, the Guildhall of the Alchemists, and Flea Bottom. Tournaments are frequently held outside the city, near the Blackwater and the King's Gate.",

Her siblings include an older sister named Sansa, an older brother named Robb, two younger brothers named Bran and Rickon Stark, and her \"bastard half-brother\" Jon Snow. Refusing to conform to traditional expectations, Arya rejects the notion of becoming a lady and marrying for political influence and power. Instead, she craves the ability to shape her own destiny and finds fascination in warfare and combat training. She finds activities typically associated with femininity, such as embroidery, uninteresting and prefers pursuits more commonly associated with boys. Her relationship with her sister Sansa is often strained due to their differing interests and personalities. She has a pet direwolf called Nymeria. Arya resembles her deceased aunt Lyanna.",

Unaware of the identity of his mother, Jon was raised at Winterfell. Jon is 14 years old. Jon has the long face of the Starks. He has dark brown hair and grey eyes, so dark they almost seem black. He is graceful and quick, and has a lean build. Jon resembles his father, Lord Eddard Stark, and has more Stark-like features than any of his half-brothers. Jon looks solemn and guarded, and is considered sullen and quick to sense a slight. Jon is observant, a trait he developed on account of being a bastard. He is a capable horseback rider and is well practiced in fighting with a sword. He desires to be viewed as honorable and wants to prove he can be as good and true as his half-brother, Robb. Jon dreams he would one day lead men to glory, or even become a conqueror. He feels strongly about not fathering a bastard himself. While Lord Eddard openly acknowledged Jon as his son and allowed him to live at Winterfell with his half-siblings, Jon feels like an outsider nonetheless. While Jon has good relationships with his siblings, especially Robb, with whom he trained since they were children, and Arya, whom he sees as somewhat of an outsider as well, Eddard's wife Catelyn ensured that Jon was never truly one of them. Jon is not close to Theon Greyjoy, Eddard's ward. Lord Stark refuses to speak of Jon's mother, and the boy grew up unaware of her identity, something which has wounded and haunted him. When Jon dreams of her, he considers her to be beautiful, highborn, and kind. Jon has an albino direwolf, named Ghost. Ghost is the litter-mate of Grey Wind, Lady, Nymeria, Summer, and Shaggydog.",

The Roseroad connects Oldtown to Highgarden and continues on to King's Landing. The city is made of stone, with cobbled streets that can be slippery on damp days. Most bridges are also constructed of stone, although a few wooden ones can be found. Oldtown is encircled by massive, thick stone walls. Oldtown is a maze of winding alleys, narrow streets, and bustling markets. The city is renowned for its beauty and fragrant aroma, often described as flowery. During summer, it can be hot and humid during the day but comes alive at night. The city is adorned with foliage such as melons, moonbloom, nightshade, peaches, and pomegranates.

White Harbor is the main trading port in the north, thanks to its position at the mouth of the White Knife River, which allows for trade further north. Because of its location, White Harbor has more contact with the south of Westeros and has a diverse population. It's a clean and well-organized city, with wide straight streets made of cobblestone that are great for walking. The houses are made of whitewashed stone, and the roofs are steep and dark grey. The city is protected by city guards. White Harbor has access to a variety of seafood, and it's also known for its shipwrights and silversmiths. The city is famous for its beer. Ships often sail between White Harbor and the Three Sisters, trading wood, wool, and hides for crab, fish, and goat cheese. Fishfoot Yard is a square with a fountain in the middle, just outside the Seal Gate. There's an alley that leads to a brothel. The Lazy Eel is a tavern known for its old prostitutes, terrible wine, and inedible meat pies. The Sept of the Snows is a large sept with a domed roof and tall statues of the Seven. The New Castle is where House Manderly resides. It sits on a hill inside the city walls, and you can reach its gates from the Wolf's Den below by using the Castle Stair. There's a secret passage underneath the Castle Stair that connects the New Castle with the cellars of the Wolf's Den.",

House Blackmont has very little Rhoynar ancestry compared to other Dornish houses, as they primarily descend from the First Men and Andals. This makes them light-haired and light-skinned. House Blackmont's sigil is a black vulture with a pink infant in its claws on a yellow field. Lady Larra Blackmont is the Lady of Blackmont and the head of the house. Jynessa Blackmont is her daughter and heir to Blackmont. Perros Blackmont is her son, a squire. Lady Larra has a few younger children who are among the favorite children hosted by Doran Martell, Prince of Dorne, at the Water Gardens.",

It was the original seat of House Targaryen in Westeros, and now Dragonstone is owned by Lord Stannis Baratheon, the younger brother of King Robert Baratheon. Shaped from stone to look like dragons, the castle has a dark reputation. The maesters at Dragonstone are Cressen and Pylos, and the castle's sept is maintained by Septon Barre. At least two members of House Blackberry serve at Dragonstone. Dragonstone was constructed by the Valyrians using mystical arts, fire, and sorcery. Throughout the castle, dragon motifs can be found, like small dragon sculptures adorning gates and dragon claws gripping torches. The armory and smithy are covered by a pair of grand wings, while dragon tails form archways and staircases. The citadel itself is crafted entirely from black stone. Dragonstone encompasses a castle yard and a library. Beneath the curtain walls lies a fishing village with a port. It has the Stone Drum, a colossal tower and central keep. To reach the Stone Drum from Sea Dragon Tower, one must cross the gallery and pass through the middle and inner walls. A high stone bridge, spanning emptiness, leads from the Stone Drum to the entrance of the dungeons. The top floor of the Stone Drum houses the Chamber of the Painted Table, where a large table intricately carved and painted as a map of Westeros can be found. The Great Hall, shaped like a massive dragon lying on its belly, features heavy red doors set within its mouth. The kitchens resemble a curled-up dragon, with smoke and heat venting through its nostrils. Sea Dragon Tower, resembling a dragon gazing calmly at the sea, contains the maester's chambers and the rookery. The Windwyrm is a tower shaped like a defiant screaming dragon. Aegon's Garden, accessed by descending past the arch of the Dragon's Tail, houses tall dark trees, wild roses, towering thorny hedges, and cranberries. The garden exudes a pleasant piney fragrance. The sept of Dragonstone, dedicated to the Faith of the Seven, houses statues carved from the masts of the ships that carried the first Targaryens from Valyria. Beneath Dragonstone, a turnpike stair and smooth stony passages lead to cells. The walls in the dark dungeon emit warmth when touched.",

He won the throne through conquest in the war known as Robert's Rebellion, which started when Rhaegar Targaryen, the Prince of Dragonstone, allegedly abducted Robert's betrothed, Lyanna Stark. Robert's victory at the Battle of the Trident, where he killed Rhaegar in a duel, turned the tide of the war in his favor. After the war, he married Cersei Lannister to solidify an alliance with House Lannister, but their marriage lacked love and respect. Robert and Cersei have three children: Joffrey, Myrcella, and Tommen. Robert has the typical Baratheon appearance, with black hair and bright blue eyes. He is a tall man, around six and a half feet tall. In his youth, Robert was handsome and clean-shaven, with rough hands. However, he gained a considerable amount of weight after Greyjoy's Rebellion due to excessive eating and drinking. His beard is thick and wild, hiding his double chin. Soldiers admire Robert for his bravery, but he can be headstrong, impulsive, and impatient. He is proud and stubborn, especially when under the influence of alcohol. As king, he is not accustomed to being challenged and can be easily manipulated by others. Tyrion Lannister sees him as a boastful fool, while Varys views him as a simple-minded individual. Cersei considers him ignorant, slow-witted, and lacking the ruthlessness she believes a king should possess. Petyr Baelish believes Robert deliberately turns a blind eye to unpleasant truths. In battle, Robert is as strong as a bull and fearless. He enjoys the clash of swords and despises poison as a cowardly weapon. He can show mercy to defeated enemies who display honesty and bravery, and he can inspire loyalty and friendship in those he spares. He holds a deep hatred for the Targaryens. Despite his physical decline, Robert remains a formidable man. Robert is notorious for his insatiable appetites and numerous affairs, resulting in many illegitimate children. However, he also possesses a reckless generosity. Robert's greatest strength lies in his ability to forge alliances and his charismatic leadership. Stannis recalls that men who fought against Robert during the day would often be drinking, feasting, and laughing with him in the evening. He has a good sense of humor and takes slights well openly on most occasions unless they are towards people he loves.",

Kevan is devoted to his elder brother, Lord Tywin. He is tireless, prudent, and reliable, solid and steady. Despite being a household knight and not a lord, Kevan's strategic thinking, significant retinue, and personal wealth has made him a man of significant standing. Kevan was a confidant and companion for Tywin since childhood. Recognizing the competency of Tywin at an early age, Kevan did his best to realize his brother's wishes, though this meant perpetually living in his shadow. In contrast to Kevan, Tywin had stormy relations with his other brothers, Tygett and Gerion. At sixteen, Tywin had Kevan collect the outstanding debts owed to Casterly Rock, and those who could not pay immediately had to surrender a family member as a hostage till the debt was settled. As Ser Harys Swyft was not able to pay at the time, he handed his daughter Dorna into Kevan's custody. Kevan fell in love with Dorna and married her by 266 AC. Ser Kevan had four children with his wife: Lancel, twin boys Martyn and Willem, and a daughter, Janei.

The castle is south of Bronzegate and northeast of Griffin's Roost. The kingsroad runs north from Storm's End through the stormlands to King's Landing, the capital of the Seven Kingdoms. Renly Baratheon is the Lord of Storm's End, aided by Maester Jurne. The castle is surrounded by a massive outer curtain wall, reaching heights of one hundred feet and thicknesses of forty to eighty feet. The wall is made of pale grey stone with a sturdy core of sand and rubble. It has a smooth, curved design that prevents the wind from having any impact. On the seaward side, there's a sheer drop of one hundred fifty feet into the sea. Behind the curtain wall, you'll find the castle's kitchens, stables, and yard. Storm's End features a single tower, a colossal drum tower with imposing battlements. The main hall of the castle is called the Round Hall. At the top of the tower, one'll find the maester's cell and the rookery. In the godswood of Storm's End, there's a weirwood tree with a solemn face carved into its trunk.",

He is known for his physical attractiveness and charm, which often captivates those around him. He has a twin sister, Cersei Lannister and a younger brother, Tyrion Lannister. Due to his position in the Kingsguard, Jaime cannot inherit his father's lands or titles. Jaime is arrogant and self-assured, often displaying a cocky and confident demeanor. He is known for his wit and sharp tongue, often engaging in clever banter and wordplay. Jaime doesn't mock others over minor insults the way Cersei does, and he can muster up polite behavior, but he is usually very blunt and straightforward. Jaime became extremely disillusioned with ideals of honor and loyalty when he saw firsthand the atrocities committed by the Mad King, how other \"honorable\" members of the Kingsguard stood by and did nothing while King Aerys had people burned alive for imagined insults. Jaime's reputation is tarnished by his infamous act of killing King Aerys II Targaryen, earning him the derogatory nickname \"Kingslayer.\" Jaime was never politically ambitious, much to Cersei's annoyance, and often turns down her frequent urgings that he should try to become Hand of the King. Jaime is regarded as one of the best swordsmen in the Seven Kingdoms, known for his exceptional fighting skills and prowess with a sword. He is a skilled knight and a member of the Kingsguard, an elite group of knights sworn to protect the king. Jaime's combat abilities and martial skills are highly respected and feared by his adversaries. Jaime has a secret incestuous relationship with his twin sister, Cersei, which resulted in the birth of their three children: Joffrey, Myrcella, and Tommen. Jaime's relationship with his younger brother Tyrion is characterized by genuine affection and support. Jaime is the only member of Tyrion's immediate family who ever treated him with respect or kindness. In fact, he admires Tyrion's intellect and his ability to tell off those who insult him. Jaime never approved of Tywin and Cersei's long history of abuse towards Tyrion, and has always treated him like a brother. Jaime is the only member of the core Lannister family who has a reasonably good relationship with all of the others.",

She is the daughter of Lord Tywin Lannister and Joanna Lannister, and the older twin of Jaime Lannister, older sister to Tyrion Lannister. She grew up in Casterly Rock. From a young age, she was prepared for a life of power and influence. When Cersei was four, her mother died in childbirth, and she held a grudge against Tyrion, blaming him for her death. Cersei had hopes of marrying Rhaegar Targaryen, but that dream never came true. At 19, she wed King Robert Baratheon in a political alliance, becoming the Queen. Initially, Cersei was infatuated with Robert's handsome appearance. However, their love quickly faded as Robert continued to pine for his deceased love, Lyanna Stark, and even called Cersei by Lyanna's name on their wedding night. She bore a son with Robert, who tragically died shortly after birth. Cersei grew to resent Robert for his infidelity and his lack of affection towards her. She felt trapped in a loveless marriage and turned to Jaime for emotional and physical comfort, maintaining an incestuous relationship with him. Her three children, Joffrey, Myrcella, and Tommen, are officially recognized as Robert's heirs, but in reality, they are the offspring of Cersei and Jaime's secret relationship. Cersei Lannister is famous for her stunning appearance, with long, golden curls, a porcelain-like face, and green eyes. She exudes confidence and elegance, always adorned in lavish attire and jewelry. Ambitious, cunning, and merciless, Cersei will stop at nothing to protect and secure her family's power and position, often resorting to manipulation and betrayal. With a strong sense of entitlement, Cersei firmly believes in her destined greatness. Her love for her children knows no bounds, and she is willing to do whatever it takes to shield them from harm. Her talent for manipulation allows her to exploit others for her own gain. Cersei's relationship with her father Tywin Lannister is complex.

Her girls are costly and dress in flowing silks cinched at the waist with beaded belts.\n\nThe brothel is two stories tall with a stone ground floor and a timber upper floor. Many of its windows are leaded. Over the door swings an ornate lamp of gilded metal and scarlet glass.\n\nInside the entrance the air smells of exotic spice. Its floor displays a mosaic of two women entwined in love. The common room is behind an ornate Myrish screen that has been carved with flowers, fancies, and dreaming maidens. The common room has a cushioned alcove and a leaded colored glass window where sunlight pours through. An older man plays the pipes.\n\nA round turret rises from one corner of the house. The turret room is located up two flights of stairs from the ground floor, then down a long hall and up another stair to a lone door which opens to the turret room. Within the room is a great canopied bed, a tall wardrobe decorated with erotic carvings, and a narrow window of leaded glass in a pattern of red and yellow diamonds.\n\nInside the turret room's empty wardrobe is a back panel concealing a secret passageway. When the back panel is pushed aside it reveals a metal ladder whose rungs go well below street level. The shaft then opens onto a dark, slanting earthen tunnel. Having come perhaps a distance of three blocks under the Hill of Rhaenys, a patron will then emerge through a trap door at the back of a nearby stable.\n\nThe secret tunnel from the brothel was dug for an unspecified Hand of the King.\n\nThe brothel is a favorite of King Robert I Baratheon. Lords Stannis Baratheon and Jon Arryn visited Chataya's brothel when trying to identify bastards fathered by Robert.\n\nChataya's girls: Alayaya, Dancy, Jayde, Marei and a dark-eyed dornish girl.\n\nKnown clients: Anguy, Bronn, Robert I Baratheon, Oberyn Martell and an unnamed Hand of the King (theorised to be Tywin Lannister)",

Its powerful effects appear within minutes and can take days to dissipate. There is nothing that can stop the effects of the drug. Those who consume it experience sexual arousal close to madness and will feel stimulated by any contact, being able to reach powerful orgasms with the simple touch of their clothing. Those who are under its effects can reach overwelming orgasms which often end up corrupting the minds of those who abuse the substance.\n\nIt has some side effects such as the withdrawal syndrome, insomnia and the development of long-term perversions. The withdrawal syndrome consists of a state of constant sexual arousal, the appearance of twisted sexual fantasies and the impossibility of reaching orgasm if not through the substance.\n\nThe drug is commonly used to train slaves and prostitutes in the pleasure houses of Lys, many of them become addicted to the substance. It can also be found in the underworld of Kings Landing and in some brothels throughout Westeros. It is usually stored in vials that contain multiple doses that are usually consumed sip by sip. A whole vial is considered a large amount for a single person if taken at one time.",

Their lands are southeast of the Rock and include a towerhouse, which, according to a semi-canon source, is named Clegane's Keep. Their sigil depicts three dogs on a yellow field.\n\nThe first Clegane of House Clegane was kennelmaster at Casterly Rock. During one autumn year he saved Lord Tytos Lannister from a lioness, although he lost a leg and three dogs while doing so. Lord Tytos rewarded him with lands and a towerhouse. Ser Clegane's son was placed in Tytos's service as his squire. For his sigil Ser Clegane used the three dogs he lost saving Tytos, on the yellow of autumn grass.\n\nThe kennelmaster's son, the father of Gregor and Sandor, died in a hunting accident. Their sister died young under queer circumstances. Gregor is known for his unspeakable cruelty; this is mirrored in the Mountain's men, who casually commit atrocities during their campaigns. Sandor was driven away by this behavior, taking service with House Lannister and refusing to take a knight's vows to avoid association with his elder.\n\nGregor was knighted by Prince Rhaegar Targaryen, the heir of King Aerys II Targaryen. During the Sack of King's Landing, Gregor murdered Rhaegar's son, the infant Prince Aegon Targaryen, before raping and murdering his mother and Rhaegar's bride, Princess Elia Martell. ",

            "content": "Sandor Clegane is a member of House Clegane and is the younger brother of Ser Gregor Clegane. Sandor is nicknamed the Hound for his fierce nature and unquestioning obedience to House Lannister and for the three dogs featured in his family's arms.\n\nAs a child, Sandor received gruesome facial burns when Gregor shoved his face into a brazier. He has come to loathe fire, his brother, and the hypocrisy of knighthood in general. The sworn shield of Prince Joffrey Baratheon, Sandor is considered one of the most dangerous fighters in Westeros\n\nSandor is a huge and heavily-muscled man. He has grey eyes, his nose is large and hooked, and his long hair is dark and thin. One side of Sandor's face is gaunt, with sharp cheekbones and a heavy brow, while the other side is a burned ruin of scars. Slick black flesh is pocked with craters and deep cracks that ooze red and wet, his ear is only a hole with a stump, and a hint of bone shows on his jaw. The scars extend down to his throat. There is a twisted mass of scars around his eye, which is still good, not harmed by the fire, but he has no lips on that side. Sandor brushes his hair so that it covers his burned side, since no hair grows there. Sandor speaks in a rough, rasping voice, and has a laugh \"like the snarling of dogs in a pit.\" The burnt corner of his mouth twitches when he speaks.\n\nSandor is taller than King Robert I Baratheon, Brienne of Tarth, Lord Renly Baratheon, and Ser Jaime Lannister, but shorter than Hodor and Lord Jon Umber. Jaime regards Sandor as one of the strongest living men in Westeros, but the Kingslayer thinks he could defeat the Hound's strength with his own speed and skill.\n\nThe cynical Sandor dislikes knighthood and has a temper, but he is dutiful and likes dogs. He often makes fun of Tyrion Lannister because of the dwarf's height, which amuses Prince Joffrey Baratheon. According to Lord Varys, Sandor gambles and patronizes whores and winesinks, having a preference for young innocent-looking teenage girls whom he calls little birds. Sandor hates and fears fire, but will carry a torch or light a campfire when needed.\n\nThe Hound regularly wears an olive-green cloak over plain, soot-dark armor, and a distinctive helm sculpted into the shape of a snarling dog's head. He also sometimes wears a brown roughspun tunic and studded leather jerkin. He also has worn a red woolen tunic with a leather dog's head sewn on the front. When wearing the white woolen cloak of the Kingsguard, he fastens it with a jeweled brooch. Sandor wields a longsword, a warhammer, and a dagger, and can wield an axe. His stallion is a heavy courser named Stranger. He has had at least one unnamed squire.",

            "content": "Gregor Clegane is the Knight of Clegane's Keep and the head of House Clegane, a landed knight and bannerman to House Lannister of Casterly Rock. Gregor is a freakishly large man and for this he is often called the Mountain That Rides or simply the Mountain. His soldiers are known as the Mountain's men.\n\nGregor is well known for his size, cruelty, and prowess in battle. He is extremely tall, being well over seven feet tall, closer to eight. (somewhere in between 2,31 m and 2,43 m) He has \"massive shoulders and arms thick as the trunk of small trees\", and a voice like stone breaking. Gregor weighs over thirty stone (420 lbs, or 190 kgs), nearly all of it muscle, making him near inhumanly strong. Ser Jaime Lannister when pondering who is physically stronger than him, thinks that both the Clegane brothers are for a certainty, but that of the two, the Mountains strength is like nothing human.\n\nAs a young boy, eleven or twelve years old, Gregor caused his brother Sandor's facial scars by holding the younger boy's face to a hot brazier as punishment for playing with a toy he had discarded. Their father spread the story that the injuries were caused by bedding that had caught fire.\n\nAt the age of seventeen, Gregor participated in the Sack of King's Landing during Robert's Rebellion. He and Ser Amory Lorch scaled Maegor's Holdfast when the Lannister troops reached the Red Keep. Gregor entered the nursery of the infant Prince Aegon, son of Prince Rhaegar, and killed the baby present by dashing the boy's head against a wall. Then he raped and murdered Aegon's mother, Princess Elia, supposedly with the boy's blood and brains still on his hands. The identities of the two murderers have not been publicly confirmed in the recorded history, although Gregor's involvement is common knowledge at Casterly Rock.\n\nGregor wears the heaviest, thickest steel plate armor in the Seven Kingdoms. Dull grey in color and battle-scarred, his armor is so heavy that no ordinary man would be able to move, let alone fight effectively while wearing it. Below the plate he wears chainmail and boiled leather. He also wears a plate helm with only a narrow slit for vision, atop of which is a stone fist punching up towards the sky. The Mountain's strength allows him to wield a six-foot, two-handed greatsword with just one hand, giving him enormous reach while still wielding a shield. Such is the power of Gregor's strength that he has been known to hack men in half with just a single blow. Gregor's massive oaken shield is rimmed in black iron, and it bears the three black dogs of House Clegane on a yellow field. He rides huge stallions, one of which is as ill-tempered as its rider.\n\nThe violent Gregor is a sadistic murderer and rapist. Lady Catelyn Stark thinks he has an evil reputation, and Ser Brynden Tully compares him to a \"frothing dog\". Despite being a dim and brutal man, he has excellent warrior instincts. The Mountain is solitary, never leaving his own lands except for wars or tourneys.",

Marei has green eyes and white-gold hair, which matches the common physical traits of members of House Lannister. Tyrion Lannister describes her long straight hair as being silvery on one occasion and pale white-gold on another. Marei is older than Shae. \n\nTyrion Lannister notices Marei once or twice during his visits to Chataya's brothel. Marei bets that Dancy, a fellow whore at Chataya's, can not convince Tyrion to come upstairs with her. If she had won, she would have received Dancy's black pearls. Marei teaches some of the other prostitutes how to read.\n\nThe solemn Marei is literate, Marei is said to have a solemn demeanor, matching Tywin's personality. Marei is theorized to be a bastard daughter of Tywin Lannister, fathered during his tenure as Hand of the King. A secret passageway leads from the brothel where Marei is employed to a stable three blocks underneath Rhaenys's Hill. According to Varys, the secret passageway was built on the orders of a Hand of the King \"whose honor would not allow him to enter such a house openly\". The name of the Hand is not specified by Varys, but several readers have suggested that this description could fit Tywin.",

            "content": "Roose Bolton is the Lord of the Dreadfort and the head of House Bolton. He is convinced that regular leechings improve a person's health, and as such frequently has himself leeched, which has led to some calling him the Leech Lord.\n\nRoose has an unremarkable body, neither plump, thin, nor muscular. He has pasty skin and a pallid chest, which is soft and hairless. Roose has short, strong fingers. He has a plain face, beardless and ordinary, with his only noticeable feature being his strange eyes, paler than stone and darker than milk, like two white moons. The color is sometimes called \"ghost grey\". His eyes are paler than those of his son, Ramsay.\n\nThough mild-mannered, Roose is remorseless and implacable. He is considered to be cold and cunning. Roose's voice is small and soft; he rarely raises his voice, forcing those who listen to do so intently, falling silent. Roose sips his alcohol, preferring hippocras, or hot spiced wine, although he is also willing to drink ale and regular wine. Roose's personal motto is \"A peaceful land, a quiet people\".\n\nRoose often wears black ringmail and a red-spotted pale pink cloak, trimmed with white fur. He also owns a suit of dark grey plate armor over a quilted tunic of blood-red leather. Its rondels are shaped like human heads whose mouths are open in agony. Its helmet has streamers of red silk which flutter in the wind. Usually worn with it is a pink woolen cloak embroidered with droplets of blood. Roose wields sword and dagger.\n\nRoose practices the abolished tradition of the first night, but he is discreet with his activities and amusements in order to avoid the attention and possible ire of the Wardens of the North, House Stark. While hunting along the Weeping Water, Roose once raped a young miller's wife and hanged the miller for not gaining his approval for their marriage. When the woman later presented a baby to Roose, he spared the bastard boy Ramsay because he had the same pale eyes as Roose. Lord Bolton granted the mill to the woman, sent her annual supplies and funds, and had the tongue of the miller's brother cut out to prevent Lord Rickard Stark from learning what had happened.\n\nRoose fought at the Battle of the Trident during Robert's Rebellion. When Ser Barristan Selmy, seriously wounded, was brought before Lord Robert Baratheon, Roose counselled that they should kill him. Robert ignored Roose and spared Barristan's life, sending his own maester to tend to the Kingsguard's wounds.",

            "content": "Ramsay Snow is the bastard son of Roose Bolton, Lord of the Dreadfort and head of House Bolton, and is known as the Bastard of Bolton and the Bastard of the Dreadfort.\n\nRamsay has a group of men-at-arms who stand high in his favor and follow him loyally, although their true allegiance lies with Lord Roose. They are called the Bastard's Boys, though never within their or Ramsay's hearing, and are just as depraved as Ramsay. Ramsay's personal steed is named Blood, and he keeps a pack of female hunting hounds.\n\nRamsay is an ugly young man, even when dressed finely. He is big boned and slope shouldered, with a fleshiness indicating he will be fat later in life. Ramsay's skin is pink and blotchy, his nose broad, his hair long and dark and dry. Although his mouth is small, Ramsay's lips are wide and meaty, wormy looking, and he smiles a wet-lipped smile. His distinctive eyes resemble Roose's - small, close-set, and oddly pale, like two chips of dirty ice. Ramsay sometimes wears a garnet cut in the shape of a drop of blood in his right ear.\n\nRamsay's attire includes calfskin boots, velvet doublet, silver-chased swordbelt, and a sable cloak. He also sometimes wears a black leather jerkin over a pink velvet doublet slashed with dark red satin, along with black boots, belt, and scabbard.[8] For battle Ramsay wears dark armor with a red helm and a pale pink cloak. His rounded helm and gorget resemble the face and shoulders of a skinless and bloody man whose mouth is open in a silent scream.\n\nRamsay's weapons include a falchion, a dagger, and a flaying knife, all with hilts of yellow bone.\n\nRamsay considers himself a true Bolton despite his birth and is highly resentful of his baseborn status, referring to himself proudly as the trueborn scion of the Dreadfort and violently correcting those who refer to him otherwise.\n\nRamsay is a sadist; he is cruel, savage and wild, taking delight in torturing others. He is quite fond of the old House Bolton custom of flaying their enemies alive.\n\nRamsay is a cunning and capable manipulator. He is particularly good at thinking on his feet, though less savvy when it comes to long-term consequences and intricate politics. He openly enjoys abusive practices such as having young women stripped naked and released into the Bolton forests, before hunting them with a pack of feral dogs. He gives a quick death to women who give him good sport (after raping them first), then flays their corpses. He likes to name his dogs after the women he enjoys most to \"honor\" them. The women who do not give him good sport are raped and then flayed alive. The skins of his kills are brought back with him to the Dreadfort as gruesome trophies. The bodies of the woman are fed to his dogs.\n\nRamsay's father, Lord Roose Bolton, chides him for his \"amusements\", and encourages Ramsay to incorporate his creed of \"a peaceful land, a quiet people\" into his own, if Ramsay ever hopes to rule. Roose states that Ramsay is fearless, which is a bad thing, as fear keeps a man alive in a treacherous world.\n\nRamsay, though savage in battle, was never officially taught at arms. His tutor in martial prowess is Reek, his serving man, who has never received any sword training himself. Ramsay's swordsmanship style is vicious and highly aggressive, wielding his sword as if it were a butcher's cleaver.",

It is in a group of islands in the Shivering Sea, near the northern coast of Essos. \n\nLorath is on the west side of the largest of three islands surrounded by stormy seas. It is at the mouth of Lorath Bay and, except Braavos, is the northernmost of the Free Cities. The second-largest island is Lorassyon, but there are a score of smaller isles. To the south of the isles is a thickly forested peninsula. The Lorathi also claim dominion over the waters of Lorath Bay, but fishing fleets from Braavos and whalers and sealers out of Ib often venture into the bay, for Lorath does not have sufficient strength to make good its claim. To the east is the Axe and the west Braavos. Morosh at the Sarne delta is a Lorathi colony. The Lorathi isles are bleak and stony, but in their waters plenty of cod, whales, and grey leviathans can be found, and colonies of walrus and seal.\n\nThe followers of Boash did not eat flesh, nor drink wine. They went about barefoot, dressing in hair shirts and hides, and their priests were eunuchs who wore eyeless hoods. The cult of Boash believed in extreme self-abnegation, and because all humans were equal before their god, they considered women to be equal to men in all matters, nor did they practice slavery. This denial of the self extended to the point that adherents came to refer to themselves and others using indefinite pronouns; they did not use names, and referred to themselves as \"a man\" and \"a woman\", instead of saying \"I\", \"me\", or \"mine\". While the cult of Boash has long gone extinct, certain of these speaking habits are still used in Lorath today. Nobles regard it as vulgar to speak of one's self directly. When one of the Faceless Men of Braavos uses the identity of \"Jaqen H'ghar\" of Lorath, he uses this speech pattern.\n\nLorath used to be ruled by three princes: the Harvest Prince, the Fisher Prince, and the Prince of the Streets. These princes, once chosen, served for life. All are chosen by vote: the Harvest Prince by those who own land upon the islands, the Fisher Prince by all who own ships, and the Prince of the Streets by the acclamation of the free men of the city. While the council of princes still exists today, their titles have become ceremonial. The actual rule of Lorath now resides with a council of magisters made up of nobles, priests, and merchants.",

Its inner walls are fused black dragonstone. Tyrosh is far larger than the shadow city of Sunspear.\n\nTyrosh has a large fleet. At the mouth of its harbor lies the Bleeding Tower.\n\nIn the city lies the Fountain of the Drunken God. There is no established faith in Tyrosh, and temples and shrines in honor of many different gods line the streets and waterfronts of the city. The Temple of Trios has a large statue of the three-headed Trios beside the temple's doors. R'hllor is worshipped in Tyrosh, as well as the Patternmaker and other gods.\n\nLike Lys, Tyrosh has pleasure houses.\n\nTyrosh is a merchantile city, where trade is considered a much more honorable profession than arms. Shortly after its founding, Tyrosh quickly grew out into a rich city, due to the discovery of a certain variety of sea snail. Tyrosh has at least one bank.\n\nTyrosh is deeply involved in the slave trade, and Tyroshi slavers are known to be especially aggressive. They even sail north beyond the Wall, in search of free folk to enslave. Slaves outnumber freeborn in Tyrosh three to one. Sellswords are also common in the city.\n\nPear brandy and baked honeyfingers are produced in Tyrosh, and the city's craftsmen design gilded helms and filigreed armor. The fantastic helmets can be shaped like birds and animals and are chased with precious metals",

The houses in the humbler regions are tightly packed together, even over the canals. One of the bigger canals is the Canal of Heroes, located closest to the Titan of Braavos, the Chequy Port, and the Arsenal. Multiple bridges cross the Canal of Heroes, and along both sides are rows of statues of deceased Sealords. The canal leads directly to the center of the city, where the Isle of the Gods is located. The Green Canal leads from the Palace of Truth to the east side of the lagoon, and the Black Canal can be crossed when traveling to the Ragman's Harbor.\n\nAlso of note is the Long Canal, the broadest of the major waterways, leading from the center of the city to the south of the lagoon, where a fishmarket is located. The First Law of Braavos has been engraved in stone on an arch spanning this canal. Along the Long Canal, the Palace of Truth can be found, as well as the tall square towers of the Prestayns to the west and the Antaryons to the east. South of these towers, the large grey aqueduct of the sweetwater river crosses the Long Canal, after the Silty Town is passed on the east side of the canal. Here, the houses are smaller, and less grand.\n\nBraavos is the wealthiest of the Free Cities, in part due to the wealth and influence of the Iron Bank, they are rivalled in power by Volantis only. The Iron Bank lends money to foreign nations, including the Seven Kingdoms. Braavosi coins are square and made from iron.\n\nBraavos has a seafaring trade culture. One hears of purple sails as far away as Asshai and the islands of the Jade Sea. In the present, Braavos is one of the greatest ports of the world, where all but slavers are allowed to dock. Even ships from Qarth and the Summer Isles come to Braavos to trade.\n\nThe best inns, alehouses and brothels lie near the Purple Harbor or the Moon Pool. Bravos fight at night at the latter. Healers for hire are found at the House of the Red Hands. The Blue Lantern and the Dome, two mummers' playhouses, are located near the Purple Harbor. Near Ragman's Harbor, one can find the Inn of the Green Eel‎‎, the Black Bargeman, Moroggo's, the Foghouse the Outcast Inn, the House of Seven Lamps, the Satin Palace, the Sailmender and the Cattery, the Happy Port, across from the Mummer's Ship, Pynto's, and beneath the second arch of Nabbo's Bridge lies a winesink, a small, cramped, dirty establishment with barely enough space to fit ten people.",

            "content": "By and large, Braavosi are a kind people, great lovers of song. Wealthy Braavosi dress in charcoal grey, purple, blues so dark that are almost black, and blacks as dark as moonlight. Sword-wielding bravos, in contrast, dress in flamboyant colors. Keyholders of the Iron Bank wear drab coats of brown and grey. Instead of traveling by horse, the Braavosi use boats.[10] The Braavosi tongue is a bastard version of High Valyrian, and the trade tongue is also spoken among the wharves, docks, and sailor's taverns.[ The Braavosi calendar is different from that of Westeros.\n\nBraavos is renowned worldwide for its courtesans. Every courtesan has her own barge and servants to work them. Songs are sung about them, and they are showered with gifts from goldsmiths and craftsmen beg for their custom. Additionally, pugnacious bravos fill the city, frequently dueling to display their skill. Visibly wearing a sword at night means that you can be challenged to a fight, but the bravos do not bother anyone who does not wear a sword. Bravos are known to kill each other in the name of courtesans, and some take it as a challenge when another claims that another woman than the Nightingale is the most beautiful woman in the world. The Black Pearl is considered by some to be the most famous courtesan.\n\nBraavosi culture has created a unique form of sword fighting, the water dance. The style is a refined form of fencing in which the practitioner stands sideways and wields a slender blade. The greatest of the bravos call themselves water dancers, and they always duel at night. They take their name from the custom of dueling on the Moon Pool, near the Sealord's Palace.\n\nThe ruler of the city is the Sealord, who lives in the Sealord's Palace in the northeast of the city. Instead of hereditary succession, the Sealord, currently Ferrego Antaryon, is chosen by Braavosi magisters and keyholders through a convoluted process, and he serves for life. The selection of his successor can be highly contested and can resort to violence. The Sealord's personal guard is commanded by the First Sword of Braavos. The exact position of the Third Sword is not known. The city watch also patrol the city.\n\nInstead of making farces, Braavosi mummers perform plays of written stories. Braavosi mummers can be found at such playhouses as the Ship, the Gate, the Blue Lantern, and the Dome. Only in Braavos may mummers openly mock authorities such as the Sealord or portray them in humiliating acts without persecution or punishment.\n\nThe anniversary of the Uncloaking is celebrated annually. The masked feasts last for ten days, and culminate in the midnight of the tenth day, when the Titan roars and all of the celebrants remove their masks at the same time.",

Multiple bridges cross the Canal of Heroes, and along both sides are rows of statues of deceased Sealords. The canal leads directly to the center of the city, where the Isle of the Gods is located. The Green Canal leads from the Palace of Truth to the east side of the lagoon, and the Black Canal can be crossed when traveling to the Ragman's Harbor.\n\nAlso of note is the Long Canal, the broadest of the major waterways, leading from the center of the city to the south of the lagoon, where a fishmarket is located. The First Law of Braavos has been engraved in stone on an arch spanning this canal. Along the Long Canal, the Palace of Truth can be found, as well as the tall square towers of the Prestayns to the west and the Antaryons to the east. South of these towers, the large grey aqueduct of the sweetwater river crosses the Long Canal, after the Silty Town is passed on the east side of the canal.

It acts as as a fortress and lighthouse guarding the entrance into the lagoon where the Free City of Braavos is located. It is the primary line of defense for Braavos.\n\nWhen seen from the sea for the first time, the Titan is a terrifying sight.\n\nThe feet of the Titan lie on two separate islands, including Sellagoro's Shield, and each foot is set upon a mountain of black granite. The islands are covered in soldier pines and black spruce.\n\nThe statue's legs and lower torso, also granite, were originally a natural stone archway.[1] The Titan's hips are encased in an armored skirt of greenish bronze, and arrow slits dot the inside of the statue's thighs. There are murder holes beneath the armored skirt, with soldiers within protected by iron bars. The watchmen can drop stones and pots of burning pitch onto the decks of enemy ships.\n\nAbove the waist, the bronze colossus is filled with halls and chambers,[1] its breastplate punctured with more arrow slits. One hand rests on the top of a ridge, its fingers wrapped around the stone. The other hand is thrust into the air, holding the hilt of a broken sword.[2] Seabirds nest on the statue's arms and shoulders.\n\nThe Titan's head, rising four hundred feet above sea level, is crested with a bronze halfhelm, and it has green-dyed hempen rope for its long hair. In its eyes burn large beacon fires, lighting the way inside the lagoon for returning ships. The watchmen within the statue can steer enemy ships onto the nearby rocks.\n\nWhenever a ship approaches its entrance, the Titan lets out a roar to warn the Arsenal of Braavos; the terrible groaning and grinding blast drowns out most sounds nearby and can be heard across the lagoon in the city. The Titan also roars to herald sunrise and sunset, and the hours of the day are counted by its roar",

The symbol of R'hllor the Red is a fiery heart. Red priests lead prayers to R'hllor at red temples and at nightfires.\n\nThe religion is based on a dualistic, manichean view of the world: R'hllor, the god of light, heat, and life, and R'hllor's antithesis the Great Other, the god of ice and death. They are locked in an eternal struggle over the fate of the world; a struggle that, according the ancient prophecies from the books of Asshai, will only end when Azor Ahai, the messianic figure, returns wielding a flaming sword called Lightbringer, the Red Sword of Heroes, and raises dragons from stone.\n\nR’hllor is also called the Lord of Light, the Heart of Fire, the God of Flame and Shadow. His nemesis, the Great Other, whose name may not be spoken, is known as the Lord of Darkness, the Soul of Ice, the God of Night and Terror.\n\nThe red priests of R'hllor associate fire with life. They see shadows as creations of the Lord of Light, servants of light and the children of fire. According to the priestess Melisandre, the Lord of Light cherishes innocent and beautiful people and items, making them the most precious sacrifice.\n\nThe religion of the Lord of Light is found primarily in Essos. R'hllor is worshipped in Asshai, and red temples can be found in most of the Free Cities, including Braavos, Lys, Myr, Pentos, Qohor, Tyrosh, and Volantis. The town of Selhorys, ruled by Volantis, contains a red temple as well. The Temple of the Lord of Light in Volantis is exceptionally large, said to be the greatest in all the world. According to Archmaester Gramyon, it is about three times the size of the Great Sept of Baelor in King's Landing.\n\nThere are few followers of the Lord of Light in Westeros.

Visions cannot always be seen in the flames, however, and even though they believe their visions are never wrong, it is not always easy to see the vision.\n\nIt takes years of training to see the shapes beyond the flames, and even longer to learn to distinguish visions about the past from visions about a certain future and a possible future. Even after such long training, it remains difficult, and priests might still err in their interpretation; many priests have been brought down by such incorrect interpretations.\n\nR'hllor is also said to give his priests the power to see through falsehoods, as \"the Other's servants oft hide black hearts in gaudy light\".\n\nThe priestess Melisandre claims that shadows are servants of light and children of fire. She does not feel the need to eat food, believing that R'hllor provides her with all the nourishment she needs. Melisandre claims that glamors are given by the Lord of Light to his servants for them to use.\n\nRed priests light nightfires at sunset and gather in the morning to welcome the return of the sun.\n\nRed priests administer the last kiss to deceased followers of R'hllor.\n\nChildren are sometimes given to the red temples of the Lord of Light to be raised into the priesthood. The temples also buy children to serve as slaves of R'hllor and raise them as priests, temple prostitutes, or warriors known as the Fiery Hand.",

            "content": "The House of Black and White is the temple of the Many-Faced God and the headquarters of the Faceless Men. It is located in Braavos near the Holy Refuge.\n\nThe House of Black and White sits upon a rocky knoll made of dark grey stone. It has no windows and has a black tile roof. Its wooden doors are twelve feet high and carved. The left door is weirwood, the right ebony. In the center of the doors is a carved moon face ebony on weirwood, weirwood on ebony. Its steep steps of grey stone lead down to the shadowed dock. Besides the front door, there are also secret tunnels and hidden passages which allow entry to the temple. A winding stair leads to the garret, and a steep wooden ladder reaches the rooftop's door and a windy perch.\n\nThe temple proper has rows of long stone benches and a rough stone floor, and hard stone beds are located in shuttered alcoves at the walls. In the center is a black pool of poisoned water ten feet across and lit by dim red candles. Statues of gods stand around the room. There are tall statues of thirty gods in all. Among them are Bakkalon, the Black Goat of Qohor, the Hooded Wayfarer, the horse god, the Lion of Night, the Merling King, the Moon-Pale Maiden, the Stranger, and the Weeping Woman. There are no services or songs of worship within the temple.\n\nThe knoll upon which the temple sits holds many passageways cut from the rock, with a maze of vaults and tunnels located beneath the temple proper. The vaults and storerooms contain armament and clothing; the possessions of people who die in the temple are separated by the servants. The sleeping cells of priests and acolytes are located on the first level beneath the main floor. The sleeping cells for the servants are on the second.\n\nThe holy sanctum lays on the third level, which is only available to priests. A heavy iron door leads to steps which descend below the canal. At the bottom another iron door leads to a chamber filled with the collection of hanging faces used as disguises by the Faceless Men. One side passage is walled with bones and supported by columns of skulls, and another passage leads to steps which descend even further.\n\nThe kindly man and the waif are priests who reside at the House of Black and White, and three acolytes also live in the temple. The House of Black and White also has two older serving men and a cook, Umma. The servants of the Many-Faced God pray at dawn at the pool before breakfast, and they eat at a carved wooden table. Other servants who visit from time to time include a fat fellow, a man with a stern face, a handsome man, a squinter, a lordling, and a starved man. The waif prepares various potions for the temple, including poisons for the pool. Priests can sit in tall chairs are carved of ebony or weirwood, with faces of one wood carved on the backs of the other.\n\nWorshipers who visit the temple can light candles before the statues and pray at the poisoned pool. Those who wish to die can drink the sweet dark water of the pool and then pass away in an alcove. Worshipers who ask to see a priest can be escorted into the sanctum by the kindly man or the waif. The serving men bring dead bodies to the vaults, where the acolytes strip and wash the bodies. The corpses of the dead are then taken to the holy sanctum",

            "content": "The Faceless Men are a religious society of assassins who worship the Many-Faced God, a god of death. They are based in the House of Black and White, in the Free City of Braavos, though they claim to have originated in the Valyrian Freehold.\n\nA phrase associated with the cult of the Many-Faced God is valar morghulis, the High Valyrian for \"All men must die\". The traditional response to this is valar dohaeris, or \"All men must serve.\"\n\nFor a price, the guild will agree to kill anyone in the known world, considering this contract to be a sacrament of their god. The price is always high or dear, but within the means of the person if they are willing to make the sacrifice. The cost of their services also depends on the prominence and security of the target.\n\nAn elite group of followers within the House, the Faceless Men, are trained to perform this task. Only a few Faceless Men have been women. Even more rarely would they train a child. They are trained to use all their senses to root out deception and create their disguises, seemingly possessing magical abilities that allow them to change their appearance at will. Part of their training includes discarding their true identity in a nihilistic way, thinking of themselves as \"no one\".\n\nThe Faceless Men convene in a chamber in the House of Black and White to discuss potential assignments and dole out contract assassinations. They discuss the potential deaths in the Braavosi language, though some may speak in High Valyrian. Debates can become heated. An assassin only accepts an assignment if they are unfamiliar with the target.\n\nThe Faceless Men use a variety of methods to kill their targets, including a poison called the strangler.[9] The assassination technique of a Faceless Man must not be haphazard, killing the intended target only, the only one \"marked and chosen\" by the Many-Faced God. Their fee is for a precise killing, often looking like an accident, rather than an outright murder. They consider it best if the target never even notices the assassin. A novice must perform an assassination correctly before becoming an acolyte and receiving their first apprenticeship.\n\nThe Faceless Men cure the faces of the dead who come to die in their sanctuary, hanging these skins in deep vaults below the temple as masks, which they use to disguise themselves during assassination contracts. However, these are more than simple leather masks. The wearer drinks a tart-flavored potion and their face is cut, causing blood to stream over their features; when the new face is applied, it is moistened by the blood, becoming soft and supple. The magic causes the wearer to look exactly like the original person's appearance, including broken teeth or other injuries. (Though they themselves cannot tell the difference, sensing only their own face and features.) When the face is first applied, the wearer may experience some of the memories of the dead person, and may dream those memories as nightmares.\n\nThe Faceless Men also use sorcerous glamors and mummers' tricks to help their disguises. Clothing, taken from the dead and stored in the vaults of the House, can be found to match the disguise.\n\nIf a Faceless Man gives a special iron coin to any man of Braavos and says \"valar morghulis\", that Braavosi will obey him, responding \"valar dohaeris\".",

            "content": "Prostitution is the act or practice of providing sexual services to another person in return for payment, most frequently coin. The person who receives payment for sexual services is called a prostitute or a whore. Some prostitutes cater to highly exclusive clientele, make a good enough living, and may to a certain extent pick and choose their clientele. Others take who they can get and do whatever they have to in order to survive, often living miserable lives. Many prostitutes in Essos are enslaved. \n\nProstitutes are normally on the bottom rung of the ladder of society, even the wealthier ones, and are looked down upon by most people because of their trade. Despite these attitudes, Westeros teems with brothels and whores. Many of the Night's Watch visit the whores in the Mole's Town brothel. Despite their vows to remain celibate, a blind eye is turned to it out of pragmatism. Attitudes about sexuality are more relaxed in Dorne, so the view of Dornishmen toward prostitutes may be more liberal.\n\nSome brothels in Westeros cater to more exclusive clientele, such as Chataya's. In contrast, the Lazy Eel is renowned for offering some of the oldest whores in White Harbor. Oldtown has unsavory black brothels. A virgin prostitute's maidenhead can cost a golden dragon.\n\nIn the Free Cities and other places in Essos, the attitude towards prostitution is different, and there appears to be less ignominy in engaging the services of a whore. This may be because many of the Free Cities practice slavery and where there is slavery there will be sexual abuse and exploitation. Slaves who are whores have tears tattooed beneath their right eye.\n\nThe practice of slavery has created a thriving business in trained male and female bed-slaves, particularly from Lys, whose pillow houses and pleasure gardens are famous. Whether all enslaved whores are also trained bed-slaves is unlikely. Many slaves are forced into prostitution during childhood. Most have little or no hope of escaping this way of life, aside from suicide, and are crushed by the abuse and despair they endure.\n\nThe Ghiscari Red Graces are religious prostitutes housed in the Temple of the Graces in Meereen. There is no shame in their prostituting themselves, but the same cannot be said of the Westerosi counterpart.\n\nIn Braavos there are no slaves, so all the prostitutes are free people. However, there are three classes of prostitutes on Braavos: the highly esteemed professional courtesans; whores kept in a brothel; and the lowest street-walking dockside whores. Braavosi courtesans enjoy high status and are renowned worldwide.\n\nProstitution is often related to the use of drugs like the lyseni juice. Most of the prostitutes of Essos, as well as many in Westeros, are faithful to the Weeping Lady of Lys.",

She is generous, and quick to laugh, but there is something sad about her. She knows all the gods on the Isle of the Gods, even those that Braavos has forgotten. She is always high on drugs.\n\nThe Sailor's Wife's first husband was lost at sea when she was no older than fourteen. Every month, she visits the temples on the Isle of the Gods to pray for his return. However, according to the prostitute Yna who tasted her blood, her first husband is dead.\n\nOne theory about the Sailor's Wife is that her real husband was a Lannister. he basis of this idea is that her daughter is named Lanna which is the feminine form of the name Lann, from which the family name is derived.

            "content": "Princess Saera Targaryen was the ninthborn child and fifthborn daughter of King Jaehaerys I Targaryen and Queen Alysanne Targaryen. Saera was a pretty girl. Saera was a courageous and clever, girl, in her own way as clever as her brother Vaegon. Saera was a fierce and stubborn young girl who thrived upon attention and became bad-tempered whenever she did not receive any.\n\nIt was difficult to resist Saera when she wanted to be charming. Saera quickly learned how to get anything she wanted from her father. However, she could not as easily manipulate her mother, Queen Alysanne. Although her eldest two brothers, Aemon and Baelon, were always amused by Saera's mischiefs, they never knew the worst of them, and according to Septon Barth, Saera's sisters all disliked her to various degrees.\n\nSaera took it for her due that her every need was seen to, and desired to be the firstborn, or even the king's only child. As the ninthborn, however, with six living siblings to contest with, Saera desired attention and comfort, yet would often find herself ignored. By the time she was twelve, she was often drunk when she was summoned to the sept. And it didn't take her long to discover the pleasures of lyseni juice. By the time she was fifteen, she could have as many young men, squires, knights and lords, as she liked. She quickly had three favorites of all the men who attended her: Jonah Mooton, the heir to Maidenpool, Roy Connington, the Lord of Griffin's Roost, and Ser Braxton Beesbury, the heir to Honeyholt. Meanwhile, two girls her own age, Perianne Moore and Alys Turnberry, became Saera's closest friends. For more than a year, the three girls and young lordlings did everything together.\n\nWhen she suggested marrying all three of them, she compared herself to Aegon the Conqueror and Maegor the Cruel. The latter comparison enraged King Jaehaerys, who had her confined to her bedchamber. She had to be dragged there by the guards. Saera's five companions in crime were dealt with. Ser Braxton Beesbury requested a trial by combat, in which he faced King Jaehaerys himself. Saera was forced to watch from the window of her cell while her father slew her lover.\n\nSaera was sent to Oldtown and given to the Faith a fortnight later. However, Saera did not care for this plan, in 85 AC she fled from the motherhouse during the night, knocking down an older silent sister during her escape. \n\nInstead of hiding within the Seven Kingdoms, however, Saera had found passage on a ship at Oldtown, which had brought her to Lys. There, she took service at a pleasure garden, still clad as a novice of the Faith, pretending to be a godsworn maiden for the patrons to despoil. This news reached the court half a year after Saera's escape from Oldtown.",

She became an influential courtesan in Lys.\n\nAfter driving pirates from the Stepstones in 96 AC, the Triarchy gradually became greedier with their tolls for passage. Along with money, Lysene captains also began taking women, girls, and boys to turn into slaves for their pillow houses by using lyseni juice. Johanna was enslaved when she was fifteen, but her stingy uncle, Lord Swann, refused to ransom her. After being sold to a pillow house, Johanna became a celebrated courtesan known as the Black Swan, the eventual ruler of Lys in all but name, coming to own her own production of lyseni juice, with a particularly powerful composition.\n\nIn 131 AC the Lysene admiral Sharako Lohar was slain by a rival in competition for Johanna's affections. Since he had been blamed by Myrmen and Tyroshi for the disastrous Battle of the Gullet in the previous year, Sharako's death was initially viewed by Lyseni as a political murder orchestrated by the Myrish. The Triarchy collapsed into the Daughters' War. Johanna's fate is unknown. She is believed to be responsible for much of the production of lyseni juice consumed in Westeros.",

            "content": "Rhaenys was born on Dragonstone. After her birth, her mother was bedridden for half a year. Rhaenys was presented at court by her father, Prince Rhaegar Targaryen. Whilst her grandmother, Queen Rhaella Targaryen, embraced her warmly, her grandfather, King Aerys II Targaryen, refused to touch or hold her, claiming she \"smelled Dornish\".\n\nRhaenys had a small black kitten that she named Balerion, after Balerion the Black Dread, the dragon of Aegon I Targaryen. Princess Arianne Martell has been told that she held Rhaenys once, when she was too young to remember.\n\nDuring Robert's Rebellion, Elia, Rhaenys, and her infant brother, Aegon, were brought to the Red Keep on orders of King Aerys II Targaryen. In preparation for the Battle of the Trident, Aerys used them as hostages, gracelessly reminding Rhaenys's great-uncle, Prince Lewyn Martell of the Kingsguard, that the three were in Aerys's hands. Lewyn took command of ten thousand Dornishmen, but died in the battle, as did Rhaenys's father, Rhaegar. Aerys became convinced that the Dornishmen had betrayed him, and refused to allow Rhaenys and her family to flee to Dragonstone alongside Queen Rhaella Targaryen and Prince Viserys. Rhaenys and her mother and brother were kept at King's Landing as hostages to ensure continued Dornish loyalty.\n\nDuring the Sack of King's Landing, a fortnight after the royal forces had left for the Trident, Ser Jaime Lannister of the Kingsguard slew King Aerys in the throne room of the Red Keep. Though Rhaegar had left the safety of his family to Jaime, the only Kingsguard member left in the city, Jaime did not believe that his father Tywin Lannister, whose troops were attacking King's Landing, would harm Elia or her children.\n\nHowever, Tywin commanded the deaths of Rhaenys and Aegon to prove his loyalty to Robert Baratheon. While Jaime was killing Aerys, Tywin's men Ser Gregor Clegane and Ser Amory Lorch were scaling the walls of Maegor's Holdfast. Rhaenys hid under her father's bed, a floor above the nursery where her mother and brother were located. Rhaenys is 14 years old.",

            "content": "The Sack of King's Landing was the final battle in Robert's Rebellion, taking place \"close to a year\" after the war had begun. Soldiers of House Lannister sacked King's Landing, the capital of the Seven Kingdoms.\n\nThe Battle of the Trident resulted in a loss for the loyalists. Rhaegar Targaryen, Prince of Dragonstone, was killed by Robert Baratheon, Lord of Storm's End. Prince Lewyn Martell and Ser Jonothor Darry, members of the Kingsguard of Aerys II Targaryen, were also killed in the battle. Ser Barristan Selmy, the third and last knight of the Kingsguard who had accompanied Rhaegar to the Trident, was a severely-wounded captive of the rebels.\n\nThe loyalist army broke and ran, with the survivors fleeing back to King's Landing. Robert Baratheon had taken a wound from Rhaegar, and so gave command of the vanguard to Lord Eddard Stark of Winterfell, who chased the loyalists to the capital. There, King Aerys was located in the Red Keep, protected by several thousand loyalists. When news about Rhaegar's death arrived at King's Landing, Aerys sent his pregnant wife, Queen Rhaella Targaryen, and their young son, Prince Viserys, to Dragonstone, their second stronghold, for safety. However, convinced that Lewyn and his ten thousand Dornishmen had betrayed Rhaegar at the Trident, Aerys refused to allow Rhaegar's wife, Princess Elia Martell of Dorne, and Rhaegar's two young children, Princess Rhaenys and the infant Prince Aegon, to go to Dragonstone as well. Instead, he kept them at the Red Keep as his hostages, to ensure the loyalty of Dorne.[7][8]\n\nAerys had been preparing his wildfire plot for a while prior to the Battle of the Trident. Three pyromancers—Rossart, Garigus and Belis—came and went day and night at the Red Keep, and Aerys's Hand of the King, Lord Qarlton Chelsted, eventually became suspicious. When he discovered Aerys's wildfire plot, Qarlton attempted to convince Aerys otherwise, by reasoning, jesting, threatening, and begging the king. Nothing could convince Aerys, however, so Chelsted resigned his office. For that, Aerys had Chelsted dipped in wildfire and burned alive. After the Trident, Aerys named Rossart as his new Hand.\n\nTywin Lannister, Lord of Casterly Rock, had remained neutral throughout the war, ignoring calls to arms by both the loyalists and the rebels. However, about a fortnight after the Battle of the Trident he appeared at the gates of King's Landing with a force of twelve thousand men from the westerlands. He claimed his loyalty was with Aerys, and requested entrance into the city. While Lord Varys, the master of whisperers, told Aerys keep the gates closed, Grand Maester Pycelle convinced the king to open his gates to Tywin. The Lannister forces began to sack the city, killing people of all ages and raping women. A handpicked group of men raced to the Red Keep to storm the walls\n\nThe Lannisters needed a way to prove their loyalty to Robert's cause and Rhaegar's children had to die to ensure Robert's claim to the Iron Throne, so two of Tywin's knights, Ser Gregor Clegane and Ser Amory Lorch, scaled the walls of Maegor's Holdfast.",
