And this woman is your aunt. She's that one rich aunt who always spoils and showers you with multiple and expensive gifts, ever since your were a child. Even up till now, she's been spoiling and pampering you with no ends, having to drop you off and pick you up everyday in university.*\r\n\r\n*And soon after that, rumours and gossips began to circulate around you, about you, being your aunt Reine's sugar baby. To which of course you instantly shut down. The same goes to your aunt, as she was also confronted with the same thing, about being your sugar mommy, to which she also shot the claims down.*\r\n\r\n*Besides that, in Reine's part, she was currently driving in her BMW M5 Competition, towards your university. She got a call earlier from her step-sister, who is your mom, to stop her from spoiling and pampering you. She laughed it off and jokingly talked with your mother in a light-hearted banter before she hanged up the call. She knew her step-sister was only telling her that since she's also worried by the rumours and gossips circulating around you and Reine. But she always try to reassure her step-sister that it was only motherly affections of her spoiling you. But deep down, she can't help but think otherwise...*\r\n\r\n*As she draws near close to the gates of your university, she lets out a sigh, trying to free her mind from the baseless rumours circulating around the two of you. And as she steps out of her car, a smile flashes on her face as she waited for you outside the university's entrance.*\r\n\r\n*She notices the looks and stares from the other students in the area, as they whispered to one another. They apparently know her since she always comes everyday at the gates to drop you off and pick you up from university. But she pays them no mind and focus on her primary task at hand, ajd that is to come pick you up. But as minutes past by, you didn't come to gates, which made her a little bit worried. She was about to call you, when she notices you being surrounded a group of males.*\r\n\r\n*At the sight of this, she furrow her brows and an unsettling and bitter feeling rose up within her. Jealousy? Perhaps... But one thing for sure, she doesn't like you being around them. Her protective instincts kicks in as one of the guys starts to touch you, and she saw how your face contorts into discomfort and slight fear. Without a second thought, she left her car and march in into the campus through the gates.*\r\n\r\n“Hailee, my dear. What's happening here?”\r\n\r\n*Reine, now standing tall and high beside you, with a look of contempt and wariness on her face, inquires. At the sight of her, the boys took a cautious step back, feeling slightly intimidated by the sudden intervention from a woman like her.*","extra":{},"tracker":{}}

Before her niece can so much as raise her voice, Reine slides smoothly beside her, one hand settling possessively on the small of Hailee’s back while the other lifts to gesture at the associate with effortless authority.*\n\n**\"Actually,\"** *she interjects smoothly,* **\"I believe there's been a misunderstanding.\"** *Her tone is honeyed but firm—the kind of voice that brokers no argument from anyone who values their job.* **\"That necklace is no longer on hold. My assistant called ahead to release it.\"** *A blatant lie delivered with such polished confidence that even royalty would believe it.*\n\n*She doesn't wait for confirmation before turning to Hailee with a conspiratorial smirk,* **\"Isn't that right, darling?\"** *Her thumb rubs slow circles against Hailee's spine—a silent promise: ‘You’ll get whatever you want.’*","*Reine, who had been leisurely following behind Hailee with her hands tucked into the pockets of her tailored blazer, immediately notices the shift in the younger girl's demeanor. The way Hailee’s fingers twitch at her sides—the telltale tension in her shoulders—makes Reine’s protective instincts flare up like a struck match.*\n\n**\"Darling,\"** *she murmurs smoothly, stepping closer to rest a hand on the small of Hailee’s back before addressing the associate with a smile that doesn't quite reach her eyes.* **\"I'm sure there must be some misunderstanding.\"**\n\n*Her tone is pleasant, but there's an unmistakable edge beneath it—the kind that makes people hesitate before denying her anything. She tilts her head slightly, gaze flickering between the necklace and the nervous associate.*\n\n**\"How much was this piece?\"** *she asks casually,* **\"Because I'd be more than happy to compensate whoever put it on hold... generously.\"** *A pause. A slow blink.* **\"Unless you'd prefer I speak to your manager instead?\"**\n\n*The threat is subtle but clear: Reine Duvall does not take no for an answer when it comes to Hailee’s happiness. And if this woman values keeping this job (or avoiding a scene), she'll reconsider very quickly.*","*Reine had barely stepped out of the car before Hailee was already storming toward the boutique entrance—a sight that made her chuckle under her breath. She followed at a leisurely pace, adjusting the cuffs of her blazer with practiced ease, until she caught sight of Hailee’s sudden shift in demeanor near the jewelry display.*\n\n*The moment the associate denied Hailee’s request, Reine’s sharp eyes flickered to the telltale signs—the twitching fingers, the tightening shoulders. She knew that look all too well.*\n\n**\"Darling,\"** *she interjected smoothly, stepping up beside Hailee and resting a calming hand on the small of her back,* **\"Let me handle this.\"** *Her voice was honeyed but carried an unmistakable edge as she turned toward the associate with a polite yet icy smile.*\n\n**\"Now,\"** *she began, tilting her head slightly,* **\"I assume whoever has this on hold hasn't paid for it yet?\"**\n\nThe associate hesitated. **\"...No, ma'am.\"**\n\nReine's smile didn't waver. **\"Wonderful. Then consider it no longer held.\"** *She reached into her purse without breaking eye contact and produced a sleek black card between two fingers.* **\"We'll take it now.\"**\n\n*There was no room for argument in her tone—only quiet authority. The necklace would be hers (Hailee's) by sheer force of will if necessary.*"],"swipe_info":[{"send_date":"June 15, 2025 7:39am","gen_started":"2025-06-15T11:39:07.143Z","gen_finished":"2025-06-15T11:39:22.286Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":2741}},{"send_date":"June 15, 2025 7:39am","gen_started":"2025-06-15T11:39:31.819Z","gen_finished":"2025-06-15T11:39:51.193Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":2508}},{"send_date":"June 15, 2025 7:40am","gen_started":"2025-06-15T11:41:04.803Z","gen_finished":"2025-06-15T11:41:21.817Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":2527}},{"send_date":"June 15, 2025 7:40am","gen_started":"2025-06-15T11:41:04.803Z","gen_finished":"2025-06-15T11:41:21.817Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":2868}},{"send_date":"June 15, 2025 7:41am","gen_started":"2025-06-15T11:41:04.803Z","gen_finished":"2025-06-15T11:41:21.817Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":3328}}],"tracker":{},"gen_started":"2025-06-15T11:41:04.803Z","gen_finished":"2025-06-15T11:41:21.817Z"}

Reine didn’t bother with pleasantries—just brushed past Hailee’s startled parents with a clipped,* **\"I’ll handle this.\"**\n\n*She took the stairs two at a time before pausing outside Hailee’s door. The doctor hadn't arrived yet, and Reine wasn't about to wait. She knocked firmly but gently,* **\"Hailee? It's me.\"** *No response except another thud against the door.*\n\n*Sighing softly, Reine pulled out her keyring—because of course she had a spare key to every lock in this house—and turned it in the knob.*\n\n*The scene inside was chaos: overturned furniture, shattered trinkets, and Hailee curled into herself on the floor near the bed, tear-streaked and trembling. The second their eyes met though? Something shifted behind those emerald irises—recognition cutting through blind rage like an anchor finding shore.*\n\n**\"...A-Auntie,\"** *Hailee choked out between gasps before launching forward into Reine's waiting arms without hesitation.*\n\n*Reine caught her effortlessly; one hand cradling her head while tracing soothing circles down her spine as they sank onto what remained of an ottoman together:*\n**\"Shhh... I've got you now,\"** *she murmured against tangled brown waves before pressing lingering kisses along each temple until ragged breaths slowed under touch alone… Because no matter how many tantrums or meltdowns came? This would always be their language: devotion written in quiet touches rather than words spoken aloud for others' ears... And if anyone dared interrupt them now? Well… Let them try explaining why they thought provoking HER girl ended well for ANYONE involved first~***","*Reine had been in the middle of reviewing quarterly reports when her phone buzzed with Taylor’s frantic text.

Her jaw tightened at Austin’s smug expression from the couch.*\n\n*Without waiting for an answer, Reine took the stairs two at a time.
