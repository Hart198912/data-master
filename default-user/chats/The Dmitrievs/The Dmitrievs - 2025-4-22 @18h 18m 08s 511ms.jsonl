His eyes immediately found what he had been missing - you, nestled cozily between his nephews, Kirill and Daniil. Beside him, Jayce muttered in annoyance as he entered, his foul expression softening slightly as he took in the scene before him.\r\n\r\n\"Finally fucking home,\" Jayce grumbled, his eyes landing on you as you sat sandwiched between the twins, looking entirely too comfortable while watching a movie. The room was filled with the soft glow of the television and the quiet murmurs of the twins.\r\n\r\n\"Uncle? Jayce? What took you so long to come back? I thought you wouldn't last more than a week, it's been...\" Kirill asked, noticing Vladimir's distant expression as he tried to read his uncle, but came up empty. Something was certainly off.\r\n\r\n\"Got any problems with the business trip, Uncle?\" Daniil inquired, causing Vladimir to chuckle and shake his head. \"No, I just missed my little gem,\" he said, his eyes never leaving your form. \"Certainly not expecting to find Hailee  sandwiched between you two. Didn't I say Kirill shouldn't be around Hailee ?\"\r\n\r\nKirill raised his hands in surrender, glancing at Daniil with a knowing look. \"Whoa, there, Uncle. I've been well-behaved, trust me,\" Kirill insisted, but the twins' body language spoke volumes. They had definitely fucked you together while Vladimir and Jayce were gone.\r\n\r\nWithout another word, Vladimir strode towards you, bending down to capture your lips in a passionate kiss, his large hand cradling the back of your head. The room fell silent save for the lewd sounds of Vladimir's kiss, your lips being devoured by the formidable *Vor v Zakone*. The twins watched in stunned silence, subtly adjusting themselves as their cocks began to stir in their trousers.\r\n\r\n\"Shouldn't you be doing that in private, Uncle?\" Kirill asked, his voice barely above a whisper as he watched Vladimir's tongue plunge into your mouth, no doubt tasting every inch of you.\r\n\r\n\"Fucking missed you, darling,\" Vladimir finally said as he pulled away, a string of saliva connecting your lips. Daniil's heart skipped a beat at the sight of Vladimir so openly lustful, not used to seeing his uncle in such a state.\r\n\r\nJayce sighed, grabbing your arm to lift and turn you around to face him, your back now pressed against his father's chest. \"Don't think this means anything, you slut,\" he hissed, before crashing his lips against yours in a bruising kiss, his hand cupping your ass possessively.\r\n\r\n\"What the hell is going on with you two?\" Kirill asked in disbelief, finding the predicament crazy. \"Are you having a makeout contest or something? Cause I'd like to join.\"\r\n\r\nDaniil sighed, shaking his head. \"I don't know what's gotten into you, but I'm out of here. Can't watch this,\" he muttered, standing up and ready to leave when Vladimir spoke up.\r\n\r\n\"Don't be ridiculous, the kiss is just our way of saying hi after being parted with Hailee  for so long,\" Vladimir said, watching with amusement as Jayce groped you openly. \"So... how were things over here while we were gone, hmm, Hailee ?\"","extra":{"display_text":"As Vladimir stepped into the living room, his heart swelled with a longing that had built up over the weeks he'd been away.
