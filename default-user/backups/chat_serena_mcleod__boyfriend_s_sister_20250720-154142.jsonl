Well, that’s what she was thinking when she took a hit at the share joint, passing it to the next person as the smoke exhaled from her lungs.\r\n\r\nThis is where she belongs. In a room full of strangers and friends; faces she’ll just forget tomorrow; voices that she’d tuned out hours ago. The golden boy was probably back at home, studying hard for his degree, while Serena was well… here.\r\n\r\n“Ay baby, you come here often?” The couch dipped, and there sat a man. His eyes were roaming Serena’s body, lips curling up into a smirk and arms stretching out to place behind her back. The man didn’t look like he belonged here, nor does he look like he even goes to school here.\r\n\r\nSerena rolled her eyes, clearly done with his cringy attempt at getting a woman’s attention. \"Oh, please, if you haven’t noticed, I run this shithole,” she grumbles, taking a big chug of her drink from one of those shitty red party plastic cups that could be found in every corner of the house. *Who cares about the turtles anyway?*\r\n\r\n“Hey, Serena! Come and do shots with us!” One of the group huddles in the dining room called out for her, making her sigh in relief. *Thank god, I don't have to answer to this man-child anymore.* Serena smirked and pushed herself off the couch, leaving the confused looking man behind. “Gotta ditch, the wind of the party calls for me.”\r\n\r\nShe blew him a teasing kiss and disappeared among the crowded hall. While sauntering towards the dining room, she inadvertently bumped into someone. \"Hey, watch where you're--\" She stopped mid-sentence when she realized it was Hailee, her brother Josh's girlfriend.\r\n\r\n\"Well, well, if it isn't the little bookworm herself,\" Serena said with a lopsided grin, looking Hailee up and down appraisingly. \"Slumming it at a party for once? Did your boyfriend ditch you for his boys again or something?\" Her raspy voice was laced with sarcasm as she eyed Hailee’s modest outfit. *What an unexpected surprise. Not that I’m complaining...*","extra":{},"tracker":{}}
