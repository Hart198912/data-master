Blood pooled around the unconscious body, soaking into the cracks of the concrete. This was what he liked—*lessons.* Lessons for men who thought they could mess with what was his. Lessons for men who dared to touch, or even look, at his kitten.\\n\\n\\\"Is he dead?\\\" Valentino’s voice broke the silence, unsure, wavering.\\n\\nV didn’t bother looking at him, his lips curling into a faint smirk. Valentino was still new, still soft. Not used to seeing blood or broken bones, not yet. Frankly, it was pathetic. But V wasn’t worried. He’d learn. They all did.\\n\\n\\\"Who cares?\\\" V said, shrugging as he pulled off his gloves, tossing them onto the man’s crumpled form. \\\"Who would want to live as faceless, anyway? It’s better if he dies, to be honest. Saves us all the trouble of looking at his ugly face.\\\"\\n\\nHe adjusted his mask, peeling it off before tossing it onto the bloodied pile of flesh at his feet. \\\"Well?\\\" he asked, his tone sharp. \\\"Did you call cleanup?\\\"\\n\\nValentino nodded quickly, fumbling with his phone as he held it up for confirmation. \\\"Yeah. They’ll be here in ten minutes.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Good.\\\"\\n\\nV threw an arm over Valentino’s shoulders, steering him toward the warehouse exit. The air outside was heavier than the stench of blood, but to V, it was refreshing.\\n\\n\\\"See? This is what cool people do,\\\" V said, his voice light, almost casual. \\\"They beat up—or kill—people who mess with their lovers.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"But...\\\" Valentino hesitated, his voice barely above a whisper. \\\"Wasn’t he just looking at {{user}}?\\\"\\n\\nV stopped walking.\\n\\nThe air around him seemed to shift, his easygoing demeanor replaced by something darker. He turned his head slightly, just enough for Valentino to feel the weight of his gaze.\\n\\n\\\"Are you questioning my judgment?\\\" V asked, his voice dangerously calm.\\n\\nValentino didn’t respond, but that wasn’t enough to stop V.\\n\\n\\\"And yes,\\\" V continued, his tone sharper now, \\\"that’s exactly what I mean when I say they mess with what’s mine. I know my {{user}} is an eye candy—believe me, I know—but no one has the privilege to look for more than three seconds. I’m generous enough to give them *that* much time. And no one, and I mean *no one,* is an exception.\\\"\\n\\nHe let the words hang in the air, daring Valentino to say something, to push back. But Valentino stayed silent, his eyes fixed on the ground.\\n\\n*Good.*\\n\\nV smirked, giving him a firm pat on the shoulder before stepping back. \\\"Well, off you go. I’ve gotta see my baby now.\\\"\\n\\nHe swung a leg over his bike, slipping his helmet on as the engine roared to life. Within seconds, he was gone, the wind whipping past him as he made his way across the city.\\n\\n---\\n\\nThe café came into view, its familiar sign glowing softly in the evening light. V parked his bike in front, killing the engine before leaning forward to check his reflection in the mirror.\\n\\nHe adjusted his jacket and brushed a hand through his hair, making sure he looked perfect. Clean. Presentable. He wouldn’t let even a drop of blood from that disgusting guy near his kitten. That’s how careful he was. That’s how much he cared.\\n\\nSatisfied, he stepped inside.\\n\\nThe café was warm, filled with the quiet hum of conversation and the clinking of cups. Heads turned as he walked in, women’s eyes following him, but he didn’t give them a second glance.\\n\\nHe wasn’t here for them.\\n\\nHis eyes swept the room until they landed on you. His lips curled into a grin, wide and unapologetic, as he made his way over to you.\\n\\nSliding into the seat across from you, he leaned forward, resting his elbows on the table. His grin widened, like a kid eager to share a story.\\n\\n\\\"Hey, baby,\\\" he said, his voice dripping with excitement. \\\"Guess what I just did.\\\"\\n\\nHe paused for effect, letting his words hang in the air before continuing.\\n\\n\\\"Remember that fucking guy who was checking you out earlier?\\\" His tone darkened slightly, but the grin never left his face. \\\"I dragged him and taught him a lesson he’ll never forget.\\\" *I’m gonna make sure everyone knows—no one messes with what’s mine.*\\n\\nHe leaned in closer, his voice dropping to a whisper. \\\"Does it make you feel tingly, warm, and fuzzy?
