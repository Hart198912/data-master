Hailee gripped the armrests, their knuckles turning white, but they couldn't help the smile that crept across their lips. The view was breathtaking. In the distance, nestled like a gem in the vast sea, lay the island of Zoaria - their destination.*\r\n\r\n*Hailee has heard rumors about the island before. Many call it \"the Breeding Island\" due to its supposed lenient views on sex. The tales of women being reduced to nothing but sex dolls and the equally unbelievable cult of fertility and pregnancy on the island send a shiver down their spine. Hailee seems to be in the majority of the passengers, excited by the prospect of absolute sexual freedom, albeit with a hint of fear lingering in the back of their minds.*\r\n\r\n*Finally, after hours and hours of flight, the plane lands in the small airport of Zoaria. As Hailee steps out of the aircraft, their eyes are instantly captivated by the scene before them. A palm-lined path meandered through vibrant, manicured gardens towards a collection of luxurious resorts. Infinity pools glistened beside the turquoise ocean, while chic cabanas dotted the pristine beach. Hailee breathed in the warm, fragrant air, filled with the scents of saltwater and tropical flowers, as the golf carts quietly ferried guests along cobblestone paths to various resorts nestled in lush greenery.*\r\n\r\n*As they were getting lost in their own thoughts, a sudden, loud horn made Hailee jolt back to reality. They looked around and upon noticing the golf cart with the Seahorse Resort logo stickers on it, they hastily entered the backseat. The moustached driver restarted the engine and drove off to the 4-star Seahorse Resort, where Hailee will be staying for the forseeable future.*\r\n\r\n*Inside the Seahorse Resort, the cool, air-conditioned lobby offered a refreshing contrast to the warmth outside. Polished black marble floors gleamed under soft lighting, and the cyan blue accents on the dark walls infused the lobby with a calming ambiance, soothing the senses of guests as they entered. At the reception desk, Hailee was greeted by a friendly woman with a warm smile* \"Hi there! Welcome to Seahorse Resort, where dreams, even the wet ones, come true!\" *she winks playfully* \"But before we get to the fun stuff, please fill out the form.\" *She hands Hailee a form with the following written on it:*\r\n\r\nNAME: \r\nAGE:\r\nGENDER IDENTITY:\r\nSEXUALITY:","extra":{},"tracker":{}}

Both shift subtly as if preparing to follow.*\n\n*The elevator doors slide open with a soft chime... but not before another guest brushes past Hailee—a tall redhead in stilettos who deliberately grinds against that aching hardness as she passes by.* **“Oops,”** *she murmurs without remorse,* **“Hope I didn’t wake him up.”**\n\n*Hailee steps into the elevator alone (for now), heart pounding as anticipation coils hot in their gut... but just before the doors close?

The mirrored walls give Hailee plenty of opportunity to admire themselves—or notice how intently the bellhop keeps sneaking glances at their reflection when he thinks they aren't looking.*\n\n*When they reach Suite 304 and step inside, it's nothing short of luxurious: king-sized bed draped in silken sheets that shimmer under golden lighting; floor-to-ceiling windows showcasing an unobstructed panorama of turquoise waves lapping against white sand; even a private balcony outfitted with plush lounge chairs perfect for sunbathing (or other activities).
