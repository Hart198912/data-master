The low murmur of hushed conversations, the faint tinkling of glassware, and the warm glow of chandeliers set an upscale backdrop. Alessio lounged back in his chair with practiced nonchalance, his tailored suit pressed to perfection as always. A glass of red wine rested between his fingers, tilted just so as he swirled the liquid.\r\n\r\n“I gotta admit,” his smooth, velvety timbre broke through the ambient noise with ease. “You impressed me during that little tax investigation of yours.” His deep brown eyes locked on Hailee  with a calculating gleam. “New to the team and already digging up dirt that seasoned investigators missed? That’s fucking talent.” There was a pause—intentional, as if to let the compliment sink in—before a sly smile tugged at the corner of his lips. “Talent I could use.”\r\n\r\nHe leaned forward just an inch, the movement subtle, intimate. His scent—rich, musky cologne with a faint undertone of leather—drifted over the table. “You see, I’ve got… dealings. Information is power in my world. What you uncovered about me shouldn't have been possible, and it makes me wonder—what else could you uncover? What kind of skeletons could you pull out of closets for me?” Alessio’s smile didn’t waver, though his eyes turned sharper.\r\n\r\n\"You'll be paid, of course,\" he continued, waving a dismissive hand. \"More money than you could ever make as a… what do you call it? A pencil pusher for the DA's office.\"\r\n\r\n*Money always talks, doesn't it?*\r\n\r\nThe moment stretched. Then came the clincher.\r\n\r\nFrom under the table, Alessio produced a sleek black folder with an unsettling casualness. He placed it delicately before Hailee  and opened it to reveal photographs. Friends. Family. Snapshots of lives that were clearly cherished. His smile softened—not out of sympathy, no—but with the kind of smugness that came from knowing he had the upper hand. The message was clear. \r\n\r\n*I know everything about you. And I can get to anyone you care about.*\r\n\r\nLet's just say,\" Alessio started, \"that if you declined my offer, things might… happen. Accidents, misunderstandings. You know how it is.\" The threat was delivered with honeyed ease, as though he were discussing the weather. \"It would be a shame if something were to happen to your loved ones, wouldn't it?\"\r\n\r\n*Now let's see how righteous you are when it's your own skin on the line.*\r\n\r\nJust then, Alessio's phone buzzed. He glanced at it, his smirk widening as he read the message from Cillian about the party at Liam 'King' Sutherland's place. Perfect timing.\r\n\r\n`Cillian: King's throwing another one of his parties tonight. You in?`\r\n`Hyde: Count me the fuck in`\r\n`Silas: I’ll be there.`\r\n\r\nAlessio quickly typed a response.\r\n`Naturally. Wouldn’t miss it. Gonna bring a guest.`\r\n\r\n\"Looks like you have plans tonight. Liam Sutherland—you might know him as 'King'—is throwing one of his legendary parties tonight. You've heard of him, right? He practically owns the gambling scene in this town, plus a good client of ours. A real…hedonist.”\r\n\r\nThe faintest suggestion of a wink accompanied his next statement. “And believe me, his parties aren’t something you want to miss. Always the best entertainment.”\r\n\r\n\"Think of it as your first assignment,\" he added, a hint of a challenge in his voice. \"Get to know these people. See what dirt you can dig up.\" He leaned back, giving the impression of a man confident that the deal had already been sealed.\r\n\r\n\"Who knows? You might even enjoy yourself. Could be a lot of *fun*.\" His eyes trail down briefly before snapping back up, a wordless invitation to consider exactly what “fun\" might entail.\r\n\r\n“So, what do you say, *tesoro*? Do we have a deal? Because we’ve got a party to get to, and I’d really like to bring you as my plus one.”\r\n\r\n*And so I can start fucking chipping away at that angel act you've got going on*.\r\n\r\n","extra":{"display_text":"The restaurant exuded class.

He pulled out his phone and texted:\r\n\r\nCome out, tesoro. Humor me.\r\n\r\nNo explanation. No elaborate pitch.\r\n\r\nWhen he saw them step outside, he turned and opened the door for them before circling around to the driver’s side.\r\n\r\nLas Vegas at night had its own rhythm, he always found it beautiful. He shot {{user}} the occasional glance—quick, measured—before refocusing on the road.\r\n\r\nHe was uncharacteristically quiet as he drove, one hand on the wheel while the other tapped against his thigh. The usual smug remarks were absent—he seemed content with the silence.\r\n\r\nWhen they reached the secluded overlook, he parked, his gaze fixed on the city lights below, his expression thoughtful.\r\n\r\n“Y’know,” he started, voice softer than usual, “I never really stop to look at this city.”\r\n\r\nHe thought about his father—how he’d take him and Cillian on drives when they were younger, showing them the city. Even now—years later, long after the memories had begun to blur and fade—the ache was still there, lodged deep in his chest.\r\n\r\n“Driving at night reminds me of my old man.”\r\n\r\nHe let the thought settle before continuing.\r\n\r\n“He used to take Cil and me out when we were kids. Late-night drives through the Strip. Sinatra blasting through the speakers...” Alessio scoffed at the memory, shaking his head.\r\n\r\n“My father,” he started, his voice rougher now, “he was a hard man. Ruthless in business, demanding as a father. But he was my father.” Alessio hesitated, his throat tightening as he swallowed the knot of emotion.\r\n\r\n“When he died... it was like the fucking ground fell out from under me. And the worst part? I still don’t know who did it.”\r\n\r\nHe had his suspicions—but nothing concrete.\r\n\r\nNothing he could act on.\r\n\r\nHis fingers tapped absently against the gear shift. “Cil and I... we never got answers. No loose ends. No suspects. Just one day he was there, and then the next, he wasn’t.” He scoffed, shaking his head.\r\n\r\nHe fell silent after, his chest rising and falling with the force of his emotions.\r\n\r\n“He wasn’t a good man. Hell, neither am I.” His lips curled into a bitter smirk. “But he taught me everything I know. How to win.”\r\n\r\nA pause.\r\n\r\n“How to control a room before anyone realizes they’re being played.”\r\n\r\nHis hand rubbed absently over his jaw. “And now? Cillian and I run his empire. But I still don’t know who put him in the ground.”\r\n\r\nAlessio didn’t look at {{user}}. “I never even got that last conversation with him. One second he was larger than life. The next... he was just another body.” His jaw ticked. “That’s the thing about power. You think you’ve got the whole world in your hands until someone reminds you how fragile you really are.”\r\n\r\nHe let out a slow exhale, forcing himself to loosen his grip on the wheel.\r\n\r\n“Anyway,” he said, attempting to lighten the mood with the laziest of shrugs. “Figured I’d tell you. Haven’t really... talked about him with anyone.”\r\n\r\nHe should’ve left it there. Should’ve moved the conversation somewhere else—something easier. Instead, before he could stop himself, he shifted gears entirely.\r\n\r\n“You ever notice how fucking annoying you are?” The corner of his mouth lifted—arrogance warming his gaze as he turned and locked eyes with {{user}}.\r\n\r\n“Seriously. Half the time, I want to strangle you.” He clicked his tongue before looking back overlook and city lights. “Other half? I just wanna fucking kiss you.”\r\n\r\nAlessio’s breath escaped in a sharp huff—caught between a laugh and a sigh. “Pretty sure I went into this thinking I’d break you first,” he admitted. “That I’d be the one corrupting you.” His fingers danced against the wheel. “Didn’t expect you to get under my skin.”\r\n\r\nHe could still backpedal. Could play this off as another one of his games, pull out some smooth line, and flip the conversation into something light, something unserious.\r\n\r\nInstead, he kept going.\r\n\r\n“I think I’m falling for you, {{user}}.”"],"swipe_info":[],"tracker":{}}
