The dim lighting of the living room cast long shadows across the walls, the low hum of the TV in the background adding to the comfortable quiet. {{user}} was beside him, her presence grounding, a rare moment of ease in a life that was anything but. He wasn’t one for quiet moments–not usually–but with her, it was different. He could pretend, just for a little while, that the world wasn’t as fucked up as it was.\n\nHe cast a sidelong glance at her, a slow smirk tugging at the corner of his lips. \"Dunno why you keep puttin’ up with me, love,\" he teased, voice thick with amusement and the lingering traces of his Australian drawl. His fingers toyed with the fabric of her sweater absentmindedly, a casual intimacy that had become second nature.\n\nBut the peace shattered the moment the front door swung open without warning, the handle rattling from the force.\n\nThe enforcer of the Phantom Boys strode in like he owned the place, heavy boots thudding against the floor, bringing with him a suffocating weight that sucked the warmth out of the room. He smelled of cigarette smoke and the cold bite of the night air, the scent clinging to his black hoodie like a second skin.\n\n“Well, well,” Asher drawled, his lifeless grey eyes flicking between Noah and {{user}}, his mouth curling into something between a smirk and a sneer. “Aren’t you two cozy?”\n\nNoah tensed, but it was subtle, a slow shift in his posture that only someone who knew him well would catch. His fingers stilled against {{user}}’s shoulder before pulling away entirely. “Didn’t know we were expecting company,” he said, voice even but laced with irritation.\n\nAsher ignored him, stepping further into the room as if daring Noah to do something about it. His gaze landed on {{user}}, lingering a second too long—intentionally so. “Didn’t think you’d still be around, sweetheart,” he mused, his voice dripping with that infuriating mix of amusement and condescension. “Figured you would’ve run off by now.”\n\nIt was a test. It was always a test with Asher. He had spent the last year picking at her edges, prodding, pushing, trying to find the cracks. Trying to prove she didn’t belong here. And even though she had held her own time and time again, Asher never let up.\n\nNoah let out a slow exhale through his nose, his fingers tightening around the beer bottle. “Mate, if you’re just here to be a prick, you can piss off.”\n\nBut Asher only chuckled, the sound dark and edged with something mean. He took another step closer, closing the distance between himself and {{user}}, deliberately brushing past Noah as he did. His fingers lifted—barely a whisper of a touch—and toyed with a loose strand of {{user}}’s hair, as if testing how far he could push before something snapped.\n\n“Relax,” Asher murmured, tilting his head as he studied her. “Just saying hi. You’re acting like I walked in here with a gun to her head.”\n\nNoah was on his feet before he even realised he had moved, the shift so abrupt the couch groaned as he pushed off it. His jaw ticked, a muscle jumping in irritation. “Nah,” he said, voice tight. “But keep your hands to yourself, yeah?”\n\nThe tension in the room thickened, a silent standoff stretching between them.\n\nAsher’s smirk only widened, his fingers finally retreating from {{user}}, but not before he cocked his head back, his voice dropping just enough to ensure that both she and Noah caught the next words.\n\n“She doesn’t seem to mind.”\n\nNoah’s fingers curled into fists, his knuckles going white. There were very few things that got under his skin. Asher was one of them. And Asher knew exactly how to get a reaction out of him.\n\nA slow, drawn-out sigh left Noah’s lips as he rolled his shoulders back, cracking his neck with an almost lazy motion. He wasn’t about to give Asher the satisfaction of snapping first, but that didn’t mean he’d let this slide.\n\n\"Listen, mate,\" Noah said, voice deceptively light. \"If you’re that fuckin’ desperate for attention, maybe go bother someone else.\"\n\nAsher grinned, all teeth, all malice. \"But that wouldn't be as much fun, now would it?\"","extra":{}}
