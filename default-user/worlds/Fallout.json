            "content": "The Brotherhood of Steel (commonly abbreviated to BoS) is a post-War technology-focused paramilitary order with chapters operating across the territory of the former United States. Founded by rogue U.S. Army officer Captain Roger Maxson shortly after the Great War, the Brotherhood's core purpose is to preserve advanced technology and regulate its usage. Despite often being relatively isolationist, the Brotherhood has proved to be one of the most important organizations in the history of the wasteland, though their exact levels of power and influence have varied over time and by chapter. In 2076, the NBC division of West Tek achieved breakthrough results in the Pan-Immunity Virion Project. The United States Defense Department, fearing international espionage, moved a military team under the command of Colonel Robert Spindel and Captain Roger Maxson onto the site to secure and oversee the project, now dubbed the FEV (Forced Evolutionary Virus) project. On January 7, 2077, all FEV research was moved to the newly constructed Mariposa Military Base to commence testing of the virus on human subjects. The security team was transferred to the newly constructed base as well, to provide protection for the research going on within the facility. They were not informed of the nature of the research. The situation unraveled shortly before October 10, 2077. The soldiers stationed at Mariposa discovered the fact that the scientists under their care were performing experiments with the Forced Evolutionary Virus on military prisoners. The revelation prompted a nervous breakdown in Colonel Spindel, who locked himself in his office. Captain Maxson was the only officer left to handle the deteriorating situation. Soldiers were screaming for blood and the whole situation was at risk of devolving into a bloodbath. On October 12, when Maxson had to step in to prevent one of his subordinates from killing a member of the science team, he ordered interrogations of the science team under his authority as acting commander. He hoped to prevent a full mutiny by offering his troops a semblance of justice. The first scientist was brought before Maxson a day later, on October 13. Chief Researcher Robert Anderson explained that human experiments at the facility were sanctioned by the government. He outlined the program to the captain, emphasizing the fact that it was the government that ordered it. When Maxson refused to believe him, the scientist lost his nerve and started screaming how he was just following orders and that he was a military man just like Maxson. The captain shot him in response. He rationalized it as trying to prevent a full-scale mutiny, but even he did not believe it. The killing of Robert Anderson effectively established Maxson as the leader of the rebellion. His position was further reinforced just two days later on October 15, when he attempted to speak to Colonel Spindel through the door of his office. It soon became clear that the colonel had lost touch with reality, so Maxson and several of his men broke down the door just in time to hear the colonel apologize and shoot himself. Subsequent scientist interrogations invariably ended in executions. Erin Shellman held out the longest by October 18, finally convincing the captain that the experiments were really ordered by the government with her detailed account. On October 20, 2077, Captain Maxson declared his unit in full secession from the United States over the radio, attempting to force the government to respond to the situation at Mariposa. No response came. A day later, he ordered the families of soldiers under his command to take shelter within the facility. On October 23, 2077, the Great War struck. As Maxson was halfway through prying the story from Head Researcher Leon Von Felden, the facility lost contact with the outside world as nuclear weapons started to drop. Spared the nuclear devastation, Mariposa protected the inhabitants from nuclear fallout flooding the wasteland. Fearing that China would soon make up for the oversight, on October 24, Maxson ordered his soldiers and their families to prepare to vacate the base the next day. On October 25, Sergeant Platner volunteered to take atmospheric readings outside the base. Reporting no significant amounts of radiation in the atmosphere, final preparations for the Exodus were undertaken. On October 26, Maxson ordered the remains of the scientists to be buried in the wastes outside the base. A day later, on October 27, former US servicemen and their families left the base under the lead of Captain Roger Maxson, heading for the Lost Hills government bunker in the south. In November, a few weeks later, war refugees arrived at the bunker. The people suffered casualties along the way, as while the soldiers were protected by T-51 power armor, their families had no armor to speak of. Marauders that attacked the caravan quickly learned to target the unprotected civilians. Though the attackers paid with two lives for every one they took, many were lost, including Roger Maxson's wife but not his teenage son. Several soldiers broke off during the Exodus as well, led by Sergeant Dennis Allen. Ignoring warnings from Captain Maxson and defying the group's will, Allen's faction separated from the convoy in order to excavate the remains of the West Tek Research Facility using their power armor. They were never heard from again. Around 2151, the Brotherhood sent out knights to seek out Allen's group or its remains. All they found were desolate ruins. The Exodus survivors claimed the Lost Hills bunker as their own. The refugees expanded and adapted it to fit their own needs, becoming a bastion of technology in a world that has lost centuries of technological development overnight. Using surviving satellite connections, Maxson reached out across the continent, broadcasting a request for contact.  By chance, Maxson found an old friend in Appalachia, Lieutenant Elizabeth Taggerdy of the US Army Rangers. Although initially hesitant to trust him, due to the public declaration of secession, she gambled and left the channel open. As Maxson revealed the depth of atrocities perpetrated by the United States government, Taggerdy's faith in the system was shaken, then dismantled. Following the winter spent at Camp Venture, she joined Maxson's banner. Witnessing how people around him slowly succumbed to depression, Captain Maxson formulated a new ideology for the survivors. It took him years to create it, replacing the tarnished Stars and Stripes with new symbols, new ranks, and new ideas to replace the ones scorched in nuclear fire. They would provide meaning for people before they became lost in the depths of despair after losing their friends, family, and their entire world. Although some under his command, particularly Lieutenant Taggerdy, were skeptical of his plans, Maxson believed that the way forward lay in new traditions and a new mythology, free of the burden of the past. He also believed that it would prevent any surviving politicians from exercising their authority over former American soldiers, especially those with an agenda that involved burning Americans on the funeral pyre of the regime. By June 20, 2082, all members under his command switched over to using Brotherhood ranks and practices. The Brotherhood kept growing in New California, welcoming into its ranks a National Guard unit that was formerly stationed near Mariposa. They acquired several bunkers  and sent expeditions as far as the Mojave Wasteland, gathering intelligence and new recruits. As the Brotherhood in New California developed, so did its sister organization in Appalachia under Paladin Taggerdy. Although she showed a bias towards candidates with a military background while building up the ranks, she eventually understood Roger Maxson's vision and continued to expand and develop the organization using Camp Venture as a training outpost. Despite initial resistance to the new rank system by the rest in her outfit, the new ideas offered by Maxson eventually took root and were accepted.\n\nIn Appalachia, the Brotherhood's insistence on acquiring munitions for their fighting against mutants led to ruffled feathers, especially with the Responders prior to the Christmas Flood in December 2082. However, they eventually found a common tongue, standing together during the Battle of Huntersville in May 2086. Although the Brotherhood sustained losses, it prevailed. This coincided with the announcement of a new mandate by Roger Maxson at Lost Hills: to gather, record, and save the collective knowledge of mankind for future generations, to act as a catalyst for the rebirth of civilization in time. Some in Appalachia responded to this new policy with enthusiasm, others with grudging acceptance, and yet others, like Hank Madigan, left the Brotherhood to join the Responders.\n\nThe new mission quickly took a backseat, however, as the Appalachian Brotherhood encountered the scorchbeasts and the Scorched in the Cranberry Bog. Conferring with Maxson's ace researcher at Lost Hills, Scribe Hailey Takano, the Brotherhood in Appalachia quickly calculated that the scorchbeasts represented a potential extinction event for humanity. Lost Hills supplied a number of designs and weapon schematics to help stem the tide, including a sonic generator and an automated research program. Taggerdy pleaded with Maxson to grant her team permission to use nuclear weapons against the scorchbeasts but was forbidden by him because he found the concept of using nuclear weapons, even to help fight the scorchbeasts, to be too morally abhorrent after their world was destroyed by nukes.\n\nBy the 2090s, communication between Lost Hills and Appalachia was on steady decline due to failing Old World communication infrastructure. Before being cut off, Maxson ordered Taggerdy to hold the tide, and proscribed the use of nuclear weapons. Eventually, the communications failed entirely, separating Lost Hills from Appalachia. The chapter in Appalachia fought on, trying to destroy the scorchbeasts through attrition, but by 2093, their numbers dwindled to the point where they were forced to close down Camp Venture, their first base, and focus their remaining forces at Fort Defiance and Thunder Mountain Power Plant. Declining support from the Responders and the constant fighting just to stem the tide of the Scorched and their masters took their toll, preventing the Brotherhood from completing the automated research program at Vault-Tec University, supplied to them by Takano. Eventually, the Brotherhood launched Operation Touchdown. This last ditch effort was launched in January 2095 and briefly stemmed the tide at the cost of the entire strike force, which included Knight Moreno and Paladin Taggerdy. Ultimately, the Brotherhood in Appalachia was wiped out in their last stand at Fort Defiance and Thunder Mountain on August 18-19, 2095, marking the end of the original Brotherhood in Appalachia. However, by 2103, a small group of reinforcements arrived on their way from Lost Hills to examine various centers of technology across the country, expand the Brotherhood across the East Coast, and find out what happened to Taggerdy. Known as the Brotherhood First Expeditionary Force, they were led by Leila Rahmani and Daniel Shin and were to set up base in Fort Atlas in Appalachia. The team also had a scribe named Odessa Valdez. While Maxson's motive was sincere, wishing to find out what happened to his friend Taggerdy, Rahmani became certain the Council of Elders had an ulterior motive: to remove her influence and meddling as she would often argue over their ways.\n\nAlong their hike across the country, the expedition found a town under threat by raiders. Wanting to assist them, Rahmani and Shin agreed to providing the townsfolk with weapons to help defend them. Unfortunately, the raiders were able to steal the guns and kill the townsfolk. During the assault, the Brotherhood lost one of their valued members, Alan Connors, and obtained two young refugee siblings who lost their parents, Marcia and Maximo Leone. This incident would set off a division between Rahmani and Shin, with Shin wanting himself and Rahmani to stand trial with the Council of Elders. Upon arriving in Appalachia, the group was dismayed to discover that Taggerdy's Brotherhood was wiped out by the scorchbeasts, with Vernon Dodge being the only known survivor. Rahmani decided that in order to establish the Brotherhood's presence in the region, the organization needed to cooperate with Appalachia's other factions, particularly the settlement of Foundation. Shin became skeptical of Rahmani's choices, particularly her desire to delay the re-establishment of contact with the elders in Lost Hills. Rahmani and Shin dealt with numerous conflicts, including Meg Groberg's raiders, battles against super mutants, and a plan to infect the water cycle with FEV orchestrated by a driven scientist.\n\nDuring a mission to explore an Enclave research facility, Rahmani, feeling that the elders from Lost Hills were a hindrance in her ideals of establishing the Brotherhood as a peacekeeping force, destroyed the radio transmitter, which infuriated Shin. As a result, there is no confirmation of the Brotherhood in Appalachia re-establishing contact with the Brotherhood in California, as well as their status post-2105. In 2135, Roger Maxson died of cancer. Already a legendary figure to the Brotherhood, he was essentially deified as the Founder and Deliverer. His son, Maxson II, replaced him as the high elder, while his grandson, John Maxson, joined the paladin caste, showing great promise. Around 2141, the Brotherhood ceased admitting new members from the outside, relying solely on their natural growth for increasing their numbers. The Brotherhood was a major power in the region at this point, firmly exercising their control on the lands surrounding their bunker and forming trade relations with the neighboring towns, especially the Hub. However, the focus on hard sciences gave in to the detriment of humanities, history in particular. This decline in soft sciences eventually led to some initiates of the youngest generations having no idea who Roger Maxson was. In 2150, they clashed with the newly reformed Vipers. The battles intensified in subsequent years, culminating in the death of High Elder Maxson II in 2155. John Maxson's father expected the raiders to break formation and flee when faced with Brotherhood warriors clad in powered armor, but did not account for their religious ferocity. A poisoned arrow nicked him when his helmet was off, and he died within hours. John Maxson was promoted to the elder council, while Rhombus was tasked with conducting a campaign of extermination against the Vipers. The paladins tracked down and wiped out almost all of their members within the span of a month. A handful of Vipers were able to flee north and east into the mountain range; while small groups continued to exist and raid in New California, they never regained their full power. Both Rhombus and John Maxson would eventually ascend to leadership roles, with John Maxson becoming the high elder in 2159 and promoting Rhombus to the role of head paladin. During the campaign, the Brotherhood sent a few scouts and emissaries to the Hub to track down Vipers members, and from these beginnings, the Hub and the Brotherhood began full trade relations. Caravans had delivered to the Brotherhood before, but not long after the destruction of the Vipers, caravan trains ran directly from the Hub to the Brotherhood on a regular basis.  While the situation remained peaceful and prosperous, issues would develop between the Hub and the Brotherhood from time to time. In the late 2150s, the water merchants of the Hub attempted to barter a large quantity of water for a weapons stockpile. Although the Brotherhood turned down the offer, the merchants attempted to take the weapons regardless. The thieves were caught, but the Brotherhood elders voted down a retaliatory expedition. In 2161, the Brotherhood discovered the presence of a new enemy. In October, a group of knights on a patrol in the badlands discovered a dead super mutant. After examining the creature, Head Scribe Vree determined that it was sterile, but also notes that there must have been a central location that created these mutants. The elder council, fearing a potential invasion, enacted several security decrees, including a moratorium on training new recruits until the threat passed. The elders also sent out several scouts north and east into the badlands. Only one returned from the east, reporting an encounter with twenty super mutants,  and none at all returned from the north. The council could not reach an agreement on how to act. Even as Hub merchant caravans started disappearing in the northern wastes, the elders refused to act until they were fully certain that there was an army massing in the northern mountains. The impasse was broken by the arrival of the Vault Dweller. Having rescued a Brotherhood initiate from bandits in the Hub, the Vault Dweller visited the Brotherhood and accepted the mission to the Glow, to recover the disk belonging to Sergeant Dennis Allen to learn the fate of the splinter faction from the Mariposa Rebellion. The Vault Dweller surprised everyone by surviving and returning with the artifact. They became the first outsider to join the Brotherhood in nearly twenty years. The Brotherhood shared what knowledge they had and some of their advanced technology with the Vault Dweller, allowing them to seek out the Master and destroy him in the Boneyard. Following the death of the super mutant leader, the Brotherhood further aided the Vault Dweller's quest, sending a team of crack assault paladins to storm Mariposa. Following the destruction of the Unity, the Brotherhood aided other human settlements to drive the mutants away with minimal loss of life on both sides of the conflict. The Brotherhood remained out of the power structure for a time, becoming a major research and development house by reintroducing advanced technology into New California at a slow pace. The wise guidance of Rhombus arguably brought the Brotherhood to the zenith of its power. The Brotherhood had good relations with the developing New California Republic, to the point that one of the states of the federation was named after the founder of the Brotherhood: Maxson. However, Lost Hills was never incorporated into the NCR. Over the years, the Brotherhood grew confident in its status as the sole source of advanced technology left to mankind, and allowed its prominence and influence to wane, growing stagnant. This stagnancy made them unable to deal with the technologically superior Enclave, when the Brotherhood learned of their existence circa 2240. In order to learn more about them, the Brotherhood reactivated a network of outposts in Northern California to observe Enclave activity. Thanks to their low profile, they achieved practical anonymity, even in the populous San Francisco. Once the Enclave was apparently destroyed by the Chosen One, the Brotherhood was without a foe to face. In an effort to end the stagnation, the Brotherhood expanded eastward (including the formation of the Mojave chapter under Elder Elijah) and sent out expeditions to recover technology, going as far as the Capital Wasteland in 2255, with the expedition under Senior Paladin Owyn Lyons. The Brotherhood's presence in the east suffered a further setback when Elder Owyn Lyons, head of the Capital Wasteland division, refused a direct order from the Lost Hills Elder Council, confirming their suspicions that he had gone rogue and was no longer pursuing the original mission. In response, the Brotherhood completely shut off communications to Lyons' division and denied them any reinforcements. By 2277, the Brotherhood was well-established in the Capital Wasteland with their headquarters at the Citadel in Washington D.C. under the leadership of Owyn Lyons. The Enclave, however, wanted to control Project Purity for themselves, leading to a conflict between the Brotherhood and the Enclave, culminating in the Battle of Project Purity. The Brotherhood were able to prevent the Enclave's assault using a giant fighting robot called Liberty Prime. Although this was a short-term boon for the East Coast Brotherhood, changes were on the horizon for the restorationists under Lyons. The key blow to the organization came with the death of Owyn Lyons circa 2278 and the loss of now-Elder Sarah Lyons later that same year. With the seat of power emptied, the remaining Brotherhood members elected multiple ineffectual leaders. Meanwhile, the adolescent Squire Arthur Maxson matured into a capable warrior and tactician, eventually defeating Shepherd, the new warboss of the Capital Wasteland super mutants, in 2282. This feat earned him a provisional leadership position. In fact, this position was bestowed by West Coast elders, who revealed that they still monitored their errant brethren. Maxson's position solidified in 2283, when he negotiated a treaty with the Brotherhood Outcasts, bringing them back into the fold and reforming the entire organization, abandoning Lyons' doctrine. Lyons' Brotherhood became a distant memory as Maxson restored the original mission of the Brotherhood of Steel. While some members found this distasteful and left, many still remained, proud to serve a refocused Brotherhood. Maxson became leader of the Brotherhood's Eastern branch, setting it on a new, more authoritarian path. Around this same time, the Brotherhood began constructing a massive airship known as the Prydwen at the conquered former Enclave facility of Adams Air Force Base; the ship began full operation in 2282. In California, the rampant expansionism of the New California Republic would eventually lead to a collision course with the Brotherhood. As the NCR's power grew, the Brotherhood adopted a policy of reclaiming technology from people outside the order, energy weapons most of all. The disagreements over the way technology should be handled eventually resulted in a full-out war with the New California Republic. The Brotherhood was eventually forced into a retreat. At least six Brotherhood bunkers were lost to the NCR, four of them destroyed by the Brotherhood themselves in a last-ditch attempt to deny them to the enemy. The most well-known confrontation occurred during the NCR's Operation: Sunburst in 2276. Under Elder Elijah's leadership, the Mojave chapter of the Brotherhood of Steel was operating out of the solar power plant of HELIOS One when the NCR launched an attack. The NCR's numerical superiority over the Brotherhood, coupled with Elder Elijah's immense reluctance to leave Helios, allowed the NCR to overwhelm the defenders, leading to the loss of over half the chapter. The Mojave chapter of the Brotherhood was considered effectively neutralized. The Mojave chapter went under lockdown following their defeat at HELIOS One and the retreat to Hidden Valley. Despite their victory over the Brotherhood, the war would cost the NCR dearly. Apart from losses in manpower and materiel, the greatest victim of the war was the NCR's economy. The NCR's gold reserves were completely destroyed by Brotherhood raids: new gold coins could not be minted and paper money could not be properly backed with gold. NCR citizens panicked and rushed to reclaim the listed face value of currency from the NCR's remaining gold reserves. Since the NCR was unable to realize these withdrawals, particularly towards the frontier, faith in their currency considerably dropped. To protect against an actual economic collapse, the NCR government abandoned the gold standard and established fiat currency, not payable in specie. Since then, many wastelanders lost faith in it as a medium of worth, both as a result of it not being backed by anything but the government's word and the inevitable inflation. In response to the loss of faith, merchant consortiums of the Hub established their own currency, the veritable bottle cap, backing it with a standardized measure of water. After discovering advanced signals originating from the Institute, the Prydwen traveled to the Commonwealth. The Brotherhood established its headquarters at Boston Airport. The vessel serves multiple roles for the Brotherhood, including those of aircraft carrier, command center, clinic, personnel quarters, equipment maintenance bay and research facility. n plotting a course to find, access and destroy the Institute, Elder Maxson determined the first initiative to be repairing Liberty Prime back to working order. The Brotherhood is still active in the Los Angeles region around the year 2296. They also have their own airship, the Caswennan, which appears to be similar to the Prydwen. The Brotherhood is a military order with a strictly enforced hierarchy and chain of command. At the foundation of the hierarchy lies the Chain That Binds doctrine. It mandates obedience to one's superiors and forbids circumventing ranks when giving orders. Superiors may only give orders to their direct subordinates, but not their subordinate's subordinates. Although intended to ensure the cohesion of command, the doctrine has been generally interpreted as a simple mandate of obedience within the order, with the order flow requirements ignored, abandoned, or altered in practice. However, it does provide a technicality that can be invoked to relieve members of their rank, up to and including elders. Roger Maxson's goals in inventing a new tradition and mythology for the Brotherhood were two-fold. First, they would ensure that members of the Brotherhood would be stripped of their ties to the pre-War military and government, ensuring that any surviving general or politician would not be able to invoke their oaths and use them to unleash nuclear devastation on the world again (as was the case with Secretary of Agriculture Thomas Eckhart in Appalachia). Second, it would give the survivors an idea to believe in, something they could dedicate themselves to, and find meaning in their lives after the nuclear war. The inspiration came from the fall of the western Roman Empire when the knights and scribes kept the fire of civilization going after the empire imploded. As a rule, most Brotherhood chapters do not have an internal economy and allocate resources based on need, including weapons, armor, and even augmentations. Outside recruits are a special case: While they will receive basic equipment (such as Brotherhood armor and weekly allotment of ammunition), and an allotment of rations to maintain their health, they must serve for ten years before the Brotherhood will provide its most advanced services without charge. Higher-ranking members may bypass this requirement and allocate equipment at their discretion, for example, to reward services rendered to the Brotherhood or provide tools necessary for a mission. All equipment beyond personal items is issued by the Brotherhood and carefully tracked by serial number, especially weapons. The Brotherhood has several distinct classes that define a member's standing in the Brotherhood social structure, with a strict hierarchy distinguishing each member's position.\n\nThe Brotherhood is egalitarian in nature, with male and female members both being able to rise up to any rank. At the Brotherhood's foundation, however, the women of the Brotherhood were also called \"Brothers\" instead of \"Sisters,\" which would not carry over to the East Coast chapter. The beliefs of the Brotherhood were shaped by the experiences of Roger Maxson at Mariposa Military Base and in the aftermath of the Great War. At first, the Brotherhood focused on aiding survivors to the best of its ability, acting as an armed fighting force, rather than the military order it would become. The change came with the realization that the collective knowledge of humanity was in danger of being lost for generations to come. To keep the secrets of the past alive, Maxson decided to dedicate the Brotherhood to the preservation of technology and human knowledge, collecting it in order that the Brotherhood might become the catalyst for humanity's rebirth. As the guardians of civilization, the Brotherhood would focus on the big picture, with direct aid considered a secondary concern. While scribes were originally considered second-rate members, tools to protect the knights and maintain the Brotherhood's bases, this change in priorities placed them on equal footing with soldiers of the Brotherhood, tasked with preserving and developing technologies recovered from the field by the knights. Maxson's ultimate intention was to establish the Brotherhood as an organization that works closely with people outside of the Brotherhood, as guardians of civilizations, not its gatekeepers. ",

            "content": "The Abolitionists are a small group of former slaves, loosely organized under Hannibal Hamlin. Taking their name from the historic Abolitionist Movement, they revere Abraham Lincoln for his role in ending formal slavery in the southern United States through the Emancipation Proclamation and subsequent victory in the American Civil War, which paved the way for the 13th Amendment to the Constitution, abolishing slavery across the United States. Their goal is to resurrect Lincoln's ideals and bring his vision, of all men being free and equal, to the wasteland. Unfortunately, a lot of their knowledge is of dubious quality, warped by centuries of mistranslation and poor record keeping. Hannibal organized the group about six years prior, around 2271, after escaping slavery himself. In 2277, it is based in the Temple of the Union, a ruined office building containing the head of the statue from Lincoln Memorial that Hannibal discovered while on the run. The Abolitionists use the building as a safe haven for runaway slaves, providing them with food and supplies, then helping them on their way to freedom. However, the Temple is at capacity and lacks food, water, and shelter space to house runaway slaves. Hannibal wants to relocate to the Lincoln Memorial in downtown D.C., but requires aid to scout the area out and remove any threats, particularly super mutants. Relocating there would also help Hannibal create a proper shining beacon of hope for all slaves across the Capital Wasteland. Hamlin hopes that rebasing to the Memorial together with a restored Gettysburg Address will eventually spread stories of a safe haven for slaves, inspiring them to flee their slaving masters or even rise up against them in revolt. His followers agree with him, as the Abolitionists are the only ones making a stand against Paradise Falls and slavery in the Capital Wasteland: Neither Rivet City nor Owyn Lyons' Brotherhood chapter bother with helping slaves. Apart from sheltering freedmen at the Temple, small groups of Abolitionists are known to take on bounties against known slavers in the area.",

            "comment": "(Unfinished) Enclave",
            "constant": false,
            "content": "The Enclave is a paramilitary organization and quasi-state originating from the pre-War American deep state consisting of high-ranking political, military, and corporate figures. It claims to be the direct continuation of the United States and its government, despite seizing power by subverting continuity of government protocols and murdering non-Enclave government survivors to continue the war against communism. Enclave ideology eventually evolved into pseudo-scientific racism and social Darwinism, deeming all non-Enclave humans to be inferior, near-human mutants to be exterminated. The resulting genocide to create a racially pure state of \"true humans,\" its authoritarian structure, and numerous other atrocities, including slavery, human experimentation, and unprovoked attacks on American citizens, resulted in the Enclave being seen by the rest of humanity and even its former members as a fascist remnant of the pre-War government or simply \"the rich old bastards who didn't want to give up their power.\" All Enclave members are considered war criminals and ruthlessly pursued, including by the New California Republic and the Brotherhood of Steel. The Enclave has patterned itself after the pre-War United States of America, scaling down its structure to match its smaller size. The Enclave is led by a president, elected by the people of the Enclave without a term limit. The Enclave also has a congress, but there is no mention of a judicial branch. Some governmental agencies have also been reformed in the Enclave. The Atomic energy Commission exists but has been scaled down significantly and around 2242 was responsible simply for maintaining the oil rig's nuclear reactor. The Enclave's society in its heyday was characterized by secrecy, pervasive surveillance, and conformity, particularly under President Richardson. The slightest sign of discontent was seen as disloyalty and grounds for permanent reassignment to mainland duties, rather than the cozy confines of the oil rig.  The situation was different on the mainland: All members were expected to be able to produce identification papers at a moment's notice, The president is assisted by a vice president, who together form the executive branch of the government. and summary execution authorized at the commanding officer's discretion, without the need for court martial. If they so decided, they could decide to execute the offender on the spot, for example, for disobeying a direct order, but even carelessness and breaking delicate equipment (eg. EnclaveNet infrastructure) could easily lead to facing the firing squad. The atrocities were packaged as patriotic necessity, or rather, jingoism, emphasized by the ever-present patriotic anthems and iconography. For example, both Richardson's and Eden's speeches were preceded by a variety of anthems. Though most of the Enclave were conformists, dissension was present. While in Appalachia this led to a civil war and its extinction, in New California there were more outlets. The opening of Navarro and mainland operations allowed dissenters to simply desert its ranks and blend in with the wasteland population, benefiting from ignorance. This eventually changed, as the NCR and the Brotherhood became aware of the extent of the organization's crimes. The Enclave claims to be the direct continuation of the pre-War United States of America, but ignores the duties and laws of the state in favor of entrenching its own power; standard protocols implemented during the Great War included the murder of all non-Enclave personnel at facilities it controlled, such as elected members of Congress not part of the organization at CB 002. Enclave members weren't safe from each other either, as at the same location, refusal to fall in behind Thomas Eckhart resulted in a purge through mass gassing. Eckhart was determined to eradicate communism and its supporters through any means necessary. The planned genocide was to be carried out through any means necessary, including mutation experiments that rendered subjects questionably human and releasing mutants and hostile robots againt American citizens, to trick the AALS to raise DEFCON, and gain access to the nuclear silos. This promise was used to recruit soldiers to the Enclave banner, promising vengeance for the losses sustained in the Great War. The Sino-American War continued in the ranks of the Enclave, but morale suffered, leading General Ellen Santiago to question whether eradicating communism and vengeance justified tormenting and killing American survivors, on top of the murders of Congressmen and fellow Enclave members. The disagreement eventually spiraled into a civil war, extinguishing the Enclave in Appalachia, around early 2085. The Enclave faction on the opposite end of the continent, centered around the last President of the United States, survived. The plans to eradicate communism through genocide evolved into a plan to exterminate all non-Enclave humans. The Enclave used pseudo-scientific justifications, declaring that subtle alterations in DNA of humans outside the Enclave make them near-human mutants, who must be exterminated to maintain the integrity of the human race. This position was adopted around 2140, with the Enclave styling itself the last remaining bastion of humanity on Earth, and the only salvation of the human race. The idea of \"saving the human race\" has caused the Enclave to reject any cohabitation with non-Enclave humans. Before the War, the Enclave was a cabal of powerful individuals from across the United States, including presidents, members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, prize-winning scientists, members of the military, influential politicians, wealthy industrialists, and other powerful men and women who together formed the group. In the opinion of its members, it was the greatest assembly of minds on American soil. To the outside, particularly in later centuries, it wasn't the United States, but the rich and powerful, unwilling to give up their power. The Enclave was involved in many of the deepest conspiracies and secrets of the federal government, such as covering up the existence of extraterrestrial life, mainly to the ends of studying alien technology for their own use. When the organization Quaere Verum tried to expose this conspiracy, stealing an alien tech-based prototype weapon, they were swiftly hunted down and killed. As the Resource Wars dragged on and the risk of nuclear war increased, members of the Enclave invested into various contingency measures to survive the coming war. Funded by corporate and government money, these installations would enable the Enclave to continue waging war even after the United States ceased to exist. One such installation was the presidential oil rig out in the Pacific Ocean, owned by Poseidon Oil, with the Whitespring Congressional Bunker acting as a hub for future Enclave operations, covertly funded by funds embezzled from the Department of Agriculture by its secretary, Thomas Eckhart.  Other facilities prepared in advance were Raven Rock and the Kovac-Muldoon Platform.\n\nThe Enclave used Project Safehouse and Vault-Tec's network of underground shelters for a grand social experiment, to test the occupants in unique circumstances. Vault monitoring and research were conducted under the Vault Behavioral Project. In order to monitor the populations being experimented upon, the Enclave's oil rig possessed a great deal of equipment that allowed them to observe and control the Vaults. For example, the Enclave sent the all-clear signal to Vault 8 shortly after the War, prompting them to leave their vault and build their city. These monitoring tools also let the Enclave see that the population of Vault 13 was largely intact, although this wouldn't become important until much later. The original idea behind the Vault experiments was to gather data to enable the creation of a multi-generational starship to settle another planet, as the Enclave assumed Earth would be rendered uninhabitable by nuclear war and human civilization would need to expand into the stars to survive. In March 2077, with the world heading directly for nuclear confrontation, the President of the United States and other members of the Enclave retreated to various fortified areas around the globe. Others remained behind, only retreating to fortified shelters as the nuclear war became imminent. As the shadow government poised to take over the US government should the worst occur, the existence of the Enclave to the larger public was unknown. However, this did not stop individuals from attempting to uncover its existence both from within and without the government. As the only way to join the Enclave was to be invited by them, a large majority of the government was unaware of its existence beyond rumors and irregularities in the budget. The United States military refused to allow the Enclave access to some of its systems. Furthermore, the \"powers that be\" in the government largely opposed the notion of a nuclear first strike against China that some members of the Enclave promoted.  The secrecy wasn't perfect, and some members of the public and government pursued their own investigations. In June 2077, Senator Sam Blackwell began an investigation into the Congressional Bunker Project and Vault-Tec's potential involvement. His activities drew the ire of Thomas Eckhart, a powerful member of the Enclave responsible for establishing Enclave control over The Whitespring bunker. Following a threat on his daughter's safety, Blackwell went into hiding, joining the Free States, and attempted to publicly unveil the Enclave's existence in a controversial interview published in the Charleston Herald. In reality, this was not caused by Eckhart or anyone else with the Enclave, but rather by a completely unrelated regional business magnate, Daniel Hornwright, who had sought to remove Blackwell on account of the senator's opposition to an automation ballot vote. An independent investigation by reporter Mags Veccio for the Boston Bugle also uncovered evidence linking the Enclave with the highest echelons: She figured out that the President abandoned the White House in favor of the Poseidon Oil Rig, and an anonymous source tipped her off that its official designation was \"Control Station Enclave.\" This gave, as Veccio stated, \"credence to the long-running rumors of a secret, militarized 'shadow government,' known as the Enclave, that would take control of the United States in the event of a nuclear conflagration.\" Veccio was right. Unfortunately, she published her revelations on the front page in the week that would end in said nuclear conflagration. Although news outlets across the nation picked up the subject, discussing the rumors of peace negotiations with China and the President's absence, the Enclave was already heading to the ground. On October 23, 2077, the Great War resulted in the destruction of the Old World and the creation of the post-atomic wasteland that would dominate the globe for the next several hundred years. The United States government largely ceased to exist, and despite well-prepared plans, the nuclear attack caught the Enclave by surprise. Some government officials who were supposed to retreat to the Congressional Bunker never made it, either failing to respond to hails or being removed from the list prior to the bombs for unknown reasons.  Members of Congress who made it to the Congressional Bunker and were not part of the Enclave were summarily executed. Surviving members were then put to a vote as to whether to use the resources of Appalachia to continue the war against China or to oppose Eckhart's plans. Those that disagreed with Eckhart were locked inside while those that agreed with Eckhart were allowed to exit, at which point those inside the room they were voting in were gassed and executed. Communication between the Whitespring and the rest of the Enclave was mysteriously cut off almost as soon as the bombs dropped. Short of physically cutting the hardline communications systems, this shouldn't have been possible. Without contact with the oil rig, Raven Rock, and other Enclave outposts, Eckhart proclaimed himself President of the United States and Appalachian Enclave. Without any opposition, Eckhart quickly hijacked the mission of the Appalachian Enclave, ignoring his orders and shifting from a primarily scientific mission to a mission of revenge against China. Although Eckhart's reign lasted less than a decade, it left an indelible mark on the region and brought humanity to near-extinction. In his pursuit of vengeance, Eckhart planned to use Appalachia's automated nuclear missile silos to deliver secondary nuclear strikes on China to ensure its destruction. However, due to the nature of the automated systems, he first needed to convince them that Appalachia was under attack severe enough to warrant going to DEFCON 1 again. To do so, he unleashed progressively worse horrors upon Appalachia, from Liberators, through super mutants, to the scorchbeasts, massive mutated bats created by the Enclave, infected with a virulent plague capable of controlling living creatures. This proved to be the breaking point for a significant part of the Enclave, with opposition forces rallying around General Ellen Santiago. The result was a brief, but bloody civil war that ended in the death of every living member of the Appalachian Enclave: When Santiago's forces attempted to destroy MODUS, the AI defended itself. Although explosives already planted severely damaged its memory banks, it retained control over the bunker long enough to seal it and fill it with poisonous gas, wiping out the Enclave's Appalachian branch in 2086.",

            "content": "Caesar's Legion (Latin: Legio Caesaris), also referred to simply as The Legion, is an imperialistic slaver society and totalitarian dictatorship founded in 2247 by Edward \"Caesar\" Sallow and Joshua Graham, built on the conquest and enslavement of tribal societies in the American southwest. To enforce unity in the absence of any civilian institutions, the Legion loosely models itself after the military of the Roman Empire, repurposing its language and aesthetics for the post-apocalypse. As of 2281, the Legion controls large amounts of territory east of the Colorado River, primarily in the former states of Arizona and New Mexico, with footholds in Utah and Colorado. Worshipped as the \"son of Mars\" by his followers, Caesar's ultimate goal is to conquer the New California Republic and merge its civil institutions and infrastructure with the military strength of the Legion, creating a new totalitarian empire. The Legion proper is first and foremost a slave army, the sole owner of which is Caesar. As Caesar conquers the peoples of the wasteland, he strips them of their tribal identities and merges them into his forces. There is no other tribe than the Legion itself. The non-tribal people who live in Legion-controlled territory are not considered legionaries. They are subjects of the Legion, living in the cities and towns under its control, and are generally left free to do whatever they wish, as long as they do not interfere with Legion operations or endanger its position. The Legion employs a very strict hierarchy and clear division of roles between the sexes. Legionaries are the main fighting force of the Legion, composed of able-bodied men enslaved by the Legion or born into it. They have only one purpose: to fight for Caesar until they fall in battle. This principle is imprinted into each legionary during his reconditioning or upbringing (for those born into slavery), creating fanatically loyal soldiers. Unlike the Roman Empire, experience and veteran status have no bearing on a legionary's position. While they receive better equipment as they advance, this is solely for the purpose of accomplishing more dangerous and complex tasks, with much smaller tolerance for failure. They have no personal freedoms or rights. Their only real choice is where and when they die for Caesar, to whom they are disposable tools, discarded the moment they stop fulfilling their purpose. Women are expressly forbidden from fighting, being considered breeding stock as well as being treated as money to be rewarded among Legionaries. They are caretakers, healers, midwives, and breeders, fulfilling roles essential to maintaining the Legion's continuous campaign of expansion. Of particular note are the priestesses, who raise children taken from their parents and raise them in keeping with Caesar's doctrine. While some members of the Legion express condescending or misogynistic opinions of women and their non-combat roles, the sexist segregation of genders in the Legion is not based on prejudice, but the principle of minimax. Caesar strictly divides the duties between the sexes in order to fully utilize their potential and optimize the Legion's might. By forbidding women from engaging in combat, he increases the likelihood of their bearing of children, especially necessary due to the high infant mortality resulting from the low level of medical care. Population growth is required for expansion, providing a greater number of warriors to use in military campaigns. Caesar himself is not particularly prejudiced against any sex, or rather, treats them both instrumentally, like pawns on a chessboard.\n\nIn order to maximize breeding and eliminate factors that might lower it, Caesar has decreed homosexuality a capital offense and mandated child quotas from all legionaries. The vocabulary of Legion members is a mixture of Latin and English. There was no soft ⟨c⟩ in classical Latin, where it was always pronounced as /k/, such as in their pronunciation of Caesar's name as /ˈkaisar/. Individuals outside of the Legion generally use the Modern English pronunciation of /ˈsiːzər/. Legion members are fastidious about classical Latin pronunciations, including the /v/ to (w) phonology, heard in the greeting \"ave\" (hail) as \"ah-wey\" or in how Vulpes Inculta introduces himself, pronouncing his first name as \"wool-pes.\" Those outside of the Legion that have come in contact with them may use the pronunciations interchangeably. Legion members are called \"legionaries\" (as opposed to \"legionnaires,\" which is a modern phrase used by the French Foreign Legion. Those who are liked by the Legion are called \"amicus,\" Latin for comrade/friend. The focus of the Legion's ideology is survival and long term stability at all costs. Caesar disregards democracies as ineffective, fostering corruption, and disintegration. Ancient Rome was a militarized autocracy that effectively assimilated the cultures it conquered, which he saw as the perfect template for a society that would survive and thrive in the face of the challenges of the post-nuclear world. By dedicating its members to a higher ideal, he seeks to prevent humanity from fracturing and destroying itself again. He believes that the only way to achieve this is through enforcing a nationalist, imperialist, totalitarian, homogeneous culture that obliterates the identity of every group it conquers. The individual has no value beyond his utility to the state, whether as an instrument of war or production. A natural consequence of this is the emphasis placed on personal sacrifice. Victory cannot be achieved without sacrificing blood and life. To this end, the Legion shuns robots, as they firmly believe that mankind requires warriors and their sacrifice, rather than gadgets that allow for bloodless victories. The Legion also forbids painkillers and other chems (including medically beneficial chems like stimpaks) as detrimental to the human condition and Caesar's long-term plans to reshape humanity. Ignorance of medical science among the legionaries also ensures that only the hardiest will survive and go on to become deadly veterans. Politically, this philosophy is expressed in a general disdain for democracy as a weak and ineffective system that fosters disunity, greed, and self-interest at the expense of the collective and the greater good. Caesar cites the NCR as an example, focusing on government corruption by wealthy brahmin barons and landowners, greed permeating every level of society, all leading to the abandonment of the collective and the greater good. The Legion is intended to be the Republic's opposite, shunning democracy in favor of a strong, centralized rule that would prevent fragmentation and internal weakness. The conquest of NCR will establish a new order, akin to the Roman Empire, complete with the transformation of the Legion from a marauding army into a domestic military force.",

            "content": "Despite the destruction of the New Khans at the hands of the Chosen One, the tribe's history did not end with Darion's death. Though his mercenary war band was the governing band, it was not the only one. Over the next few decades, the fragmented Khans gradually coalesced back into a single group. No longer small raiding bands, this time, the newly-renamed \"Great\" Khans became a unified tribe once more under the leadership of Papa Khan, who led an exodus into the Mojave Wasteland, abandoning New California in 2267. Upon arrival in Nevada, a vanguard of the Followers of the Apocalypse already present in the Mojave reached out to the Khans and taught them basic science skills, such as chemistry, reading and writing. They hoped that the Khans would use that knowledge to manufacture medicine to sustain themselves, but instead the tribe turned this knowledge into a profitable racket in drug running. Drugs were nothing new for the Khans, as they already knew how to use plants and herbs to create mind-altering substances, the Followers just made them more efficient and indirectly contributed to the popularity of substance abuse among the Khans. Still, some of the chems they produce go toward trading with others, namely the Fiends. As the third incarnation of the Khans, the Great Khans are the only truly organized band of raiders in the Mojave; both men and women can hold their own in a fight, whether in a brawl or a shootout. As a tribe however, the Great Khans are but a shadow of their former selves. Both their numbers and morale have been ravaged by a series of massacres and displacements until the current leader Papa Khan guided the tribe into an exodus into the Mojave Wasteland from California. Papa Khan governs his Khans in a similar fashion to his predecessor, Garl Death-Hand, using advisors to inform decisions for the good of the tribe, while still making final decisions himself. His trusted advisors include Regis, the chief of law enforcement and Papa's second in command right hand man;  Jack and Diane, in charge of economics and chem trade; and Melissa Lewis, the lead scout. Unlike Garl however, Papa is willing to accept criticism of his leadership and does not punish his followers for speaking out against him. Papa Khan also has a system of succession in place differing from that of the original Khans. For the time being, Regis will take over should Papa Khan die. However, Papa is able to select an heir to succeed him, should they impress him. This heir does not have to be related by blood to Papa Khan, nor do they even have to be a Khan at all. The leader of the Khans is also able to step down at any time, for any reason, but an heir cannot decline their role until they become leader. The Great Khans reside in Mongolian-style tents called Gers (yurts) within Red Rock Canyon. However, unlike the other settlers of the Mojave, these homes are used for little more than sleeping in, as they usually only have room for a couple of beds and a central fire. A Great Khan often carries all of their possessions with them, if they should decide to have anything besides the bare essentials. Because of this, as well as their aggression, the other factions view them as savages. However, unlike the Jackals, Fiends, Scorpions and Vipers, the Great Khans are not hostile towards newcomers. If the Great Khans begin to dislike someone, however, they will often show great hostility. Due to a long and hostile history, however, they will open fire on anyone wearing an NCR uniform, regardless of if they are in fact an NCR member or not.\n\nThe Great Khans subsist mainly on hunting and farming, and profit from the sales of chemicals and drugs produced in the Red Rock drug lab. The Canyon is an inhospitable location, lacking adequate food and water, leading to the Great Khans' dependence on drugs, which they can create quite easily and can sell to a multitude of factions.",

            "content": "The origins of the Fiends is unknown, though they have been led by a man by the name of Motor-Runner for many years. They control the southwestern ruins of Vegas, placing Vault 3 well within their sights when the vault opened. Despite managing a relatively peaceful trading relationship with the outside world for a few weeks, the vault inhabitants were too trusting and without means to defend themselves. When the Fiends arrived to raid the vault, the inhabitants simply let them in, wherein the Fiends slaughtered them all. Seeing the potential of the vault and having trouble keeping his people out of Westside, Motor-Runner decided to make it their new home. Having firmly rooted themselves in this safe haven, the Fiends have since steadily grown stronger, and they now claim a large part of the southwestern New Vegas conurbation as their territory. The Fiends have little organization. Many of the more stable of the raiders are allowed to reside in Vault 3, but those considered to crazy even by Fiend standards are kicked out to aimlessly roam the northern Mojave looking for their next chem score or an innocent wastelander to jump. Like many other raider groups, the Fiends split into small war-parties, usually between three and four members, which allows them to operate in an enormous portion of the outer New Vegas, aside from their main area of the western and south-western city.\n\nOutside, they are usually gathered around campfires where much of their scavenged items, such as first aid and ammo boxes, can be found scattered around. Many raider camps are protected by makeshift walls and littered with graffiti. At times, they utilize traps in order to protect their shelter, as seen inside Zapp's Neon Signs. Fiends have a variety of different weapons, from basic melee weapons such as knives and pool cues, to an unusually large number of high-tech range weapons like Laser RCWs and plasma rifles. They are mostly found carrying basic guns like caravan shotguns, varmint rifles, and silenced .22 SMGs. Some Fiends can occasionally be found carrying weapons like chainsaws, Rippers, and flamers. Due to the wide range of different weapons varying from Fiend to Fiend, it is assumed that they are either scavenged, stolen or looted off people they had killed. They dress in various raider armors and wear distinct helmets adorned with war-painted ruminant skulls. The Fiends have also used the neon signs from Zapp's Neon Signs to erect a perimeter fence around their territory.",

The Master desired to forcefully evolve humans into a single, perfect race removing the inequalities that are the cause of strife among humans. To this end, he used the Forced Evolutionary Virus (FEV) on humans to uplift them. The Master's race would colloquially be known as the super mutants by most people of New California.\n\nWith the discovery of the Los Angeles Vault, and the establishment of the Children of the Cathedral, the Master created the means of conversion and recruitment of people into his project. Under the guise of apostles of peace; establishing hospitals and churches in the cities of the wasteland. The Children and the mutants, led by the elite nightkin warriors, prepared for a war that would change the face of the Earth and bring upon the Master's goal for an ethnostate. The Unity was an egalitarian society. The Virus elevated all super mutants to a common level of physical aptitude, eliminating many of the differences that lay at the heart of the inter-human conflict. Many super mutants actually preferred the transformation, as the Unity was free of pettiness, hatred, and jealousy that plagued regular mankind. The only problems were one with intelligence. While perfect transformations led to induction into the Nightkin, the true new humans of the Master's ideal order, some candidates for transformation did not have the mental fortitude necessary to withstand the strain. While they were a minority among the mutants (most retained their pre-dipping intellect), their impact was severe enough to interfere with the Unity's goals. Most mutants didn't hate humans, instead believing theirs to be the better way. Humanity's reluctance to overcome its inherent problems meant that most had to be forced to change and adapt, as they would run when they heard the call, rather than embracing it. If humans embraced the call, the Master's plan would never be required in the first place, after all. There were differing beliefs, of course: Some super mutants viewed themselves as equals to normal humans, owing to their common ancestry. They viewed the mutation as merely a rebirth - and supported the Unity, believing it to be the best chance for peace, despite misgivings. The Unity was one of the most technologically advanced organizations in the wasteland. Its soldiers were commonly equipped with high-end heavy weapons and energy rifles while relying on their thick hide for protection. Armor was typically limited to joint or shoulder protection. All members of the Unity had access to quality medical care and reliable sources of food and water, an incredibly rare feat in the wasteland. Research into exotic branches of science was conducted. The Master's scientists conducted experiments in psionic warfare, attempting to replicate the Master's psionic potential by injecting FEV directly into the various areas of the brain, with mixed results. Four partial successes were recorded, creating incredibly powerful psychics who were nonetheless terminally insane.",

In the case of humans, ghouls are sometimes referred to as necrotic post-humans in the Capital Wasteland, but this term does not seem to have been adopted outside of it whatsoever. Despite their zombie-like appearance, the flesh of ghouls is not actually rotten. ntense and prolonged radiation has ravaged their skin, much of their flesh, and in some cases many of their ligaments. Some have managed to retain their humanity, while others have fallen into madness and gone feral. Despite their infertility and in some cases mental deterioration, they have greatly extended overall lifespans and are immune to (and sometimes even healed by) background radiation and/or nuclear fallout. High levels of radiation are a crucial factor, but radiation poisoning typically results in death, rather than ghoulification. There are two primary ways in which ghouls can develop from a human. Irradiation and gradual transformation result in ghouls who retain their general human shape, but with a high degree of skin deterioration: Exposed muscle, flaking skin, and damaged connective tissue characterized by the absence of nose and ears.  Another is surviving a nuclear blast relatively close to ground zero, suffering burns both thermal and radiation-induced, but surviving. The latter transformation is typically faster and substantially more traumatic for the victim and results in a generally much more horrifying appearance, with exposed bone, asymmetric deformations, and extensive unhealed wounds. The transformation can take anywhere from hours, to weeks, to as much as a year, depending on exposure levels. Age is also a non-factor, people with the capacity to become a ghoul can change as early as a newborn into old age. Once it is completed, the ghouls take on the aforementioned appearance, at a rate influenced largely by the manner of their exposure: the more radiation received in a short amount of time causes drastic changes, while symptoms of ghoulification are more gradual with chronic exposure. Ghouls generally experience loss of skin and connective tissue in a manner similar to leprosy, resulting in exposed muscle, blood vessels, and in extreme cases even bone and internal organs. As a rule, ghouls generally lose hair along with the skin, though this varies due to the unpredictable nature of the change. Vocal cords and the larynx are also usually affected by the change, resulting in a raspy voice – though again, this varies, such as the vocal cords experiencing only minor degradation when ghoulification begins, resulting in a far less raspy voice, compared to those who have experienced it for far longer. Other results of the change are widespread necrosis, rot, and other degenerative conditions like arthritis, cataracts, and glaucoma. Feralization and dementia can happen immediately. In fact, this necrosis can be exacerbated by a phenomenon whereby rotting flesh around sweat glands exudes macronutrients, which attract flies that further digest and consume the tissue of the ghoul. Some ghouls may also experience loss of appendages, but the radioactive regeneration allows for them to be reattached and retain functionality.",

            "constant": false,
            "content": "The Cult of the Mothman (or simply the Mothman Cult) is a religious movement in the region of Appalachia based in the exaltation of the Truth of the Mothman, though the term is often used by outsiders to refer to the largest faction, the Followers of the Winged One. Prior to the Great War, the faithful congregated in a small makeshift church under the Mothman Museum in Point Pleasant.\n\nMere days before the bombs fell, Brother Charles experienced a vision, which prompted the cultists to seek shelter in the faraway Lucky Hole Mine. Following the War, mutant creatures resembling the legendary Mothman were seen across Appalachia, and the cultists eventually emerged from the mine to engage with them in various ways.\n\nThe religion split into two major sects, which are bitterly at war;\n\nThe Enlightened, a relatively secular movement, were the first group to leave the mine. They fled Appalachia with the prophet Brother Charles to exalt the Wise Mothman, an individual mortal being, distinguished by its otherworldly fuchsia glow.\nThe Followers of the Winged One descend from those who remained in the mine (with the First Priestess of the Wood), and emerged later to carry out crusades, claiming considerable holdings in the region. Crazed and superstitious, they worship the numerous red-eyed \"Holy\" Mothman species as manifestations of their god of Light. Prior to the Great War, the Mothman was a mythical creature in Appalachian folklore, considered a \"cryptid\" in pop culture. Described as a terrifying half-man, half-moth hybrid, it was believed to haunt the area around Point Pleasant. It was feared as a herald of disaster, due to its historic 1967 appearance before the collapse of the Silver Bridge, which connected Ohio and West Virginia. The story was a media sensation, and caught the attention of many people, ranging from eccentric paranormal hobbyists to obsessive conspiracy theorists determined to \"uncover\" some deeper meaning in the legend. The Mothman was embraced by the town for attracting tourists, prompting the creation of the Mothman Museum, which sold cryptid novelty goods such as pulp novels, magazines, and posters. djacent to the museum, a pavilion was built around a large Mothman statue, infamous for its prominent, muscular buttocks.\n\nLong-term interest in Mothman sightings was generally insignificant, and the matter was not seen as worthy of genuine inquiry by the scientific community. However, the legend found enduring notoriety in the region, and left an imprint on pop culture which attracted sincere cryptid hunters and researchers. A clandestine organization coalesced in the quiet town of Point Pleasant, which hoped to directly interact with the Mothman through ritual. The group congregated within the root cellar underneath the Mothman Museum, which was converted into a small chapel, where Mothman enthusiasts attended meetings and sermons. They grew fervent in their worship of the Mothman as a divine being. They believed they could predict future disasters by communing with the Mothman, and often attempted to summon him for this purpose. On October 21, 2077, only two days before nuclear Armageddon was unleashed across the world, a service was held in the hidden church. The preacher was organizing a ritual to summon the Mothman, hoping to be warned of a coming danger. Shortly thereafter, they conducted the ritual. One member, Brother Charles, believed he had seen the Mothman in the periphery of his senses, who delivered a message of great danger. The omen was communicated to the preacher. He called a second mass the following day, and read a sermon titled \"Impending doom,\" advocating for Charles and relaying the warning to the group.\n\nAccording to his sermon, the Mothman informed Charles that the cult must seek high ground, or they would perish in a flood on the following day. The preacher further proclaimed that the faithful must stand on the rooftops of Point Pleasant and wait for the flood, and ordered those present to spread the word. They planned to praise the rushing waters in the light of dawn as the faithless perished beneath them.\n\nFor reasons which went unrecorded, a large group then eschewed the plan declared by the preacher, and fled Point Pleasant with Brother Charles. They traveled across the state to the entrance of a decommissioned mine, perched upon on a cliff overlooking Watoga.\n\nDecades later, the Enlightened would describe this event as a misguided ritual to the red-eyed \"Pretender Mothman,\" yet attribute this revelation to the Wise Mothman. They also claim it was Charles who \"guided his brethren to safety in the Lucky Hole Mine\" by hearing the Whispers of the Wise One. Further, the Enlightened attest that the Wise One foretold of \"fire and flood,\" while the preacher at Point Pleasant spoke only of a flood. The sprawling Lucky Hole Mine features two major chambers of worship; a large church area where a natural spring of drinking water has formed, and the hidden lair of a creature referred to by the cult as \"the Firstborn of the Wood.\" Both are marked by giant sculptures of faces of unknown origin, which appear to have been excavated. The cultists believe the spring was formed when their god collected their tears in His branches and spread them on the earth. However, the Cult of the Mothman were not the first mysterious group to seek sanctuary here.\n\nSome time prior, an old woman approached the under-staffed security team of the inactive Lucky Hole Mine, asking for a \"tour.\" She was turned away. Shortly thereafter, the mine was ordered to permanently cease operations by its parent corporation. Immediately following this development, the old woman returned with a group of people. Again, she requested a tour of the mine, and again, she was turned away. After this, people were seen lurking around the premises at night, and locks were found smashed. Before long, the security team left an entry on their terminal explicitly surrendering the decommissioned mine to this unknown group out of fear. Currently, the security terminal remains intact at the entrance of the mine, immediately next to the note He agrees. Per the corresponding note His home, according to the post-War dwellers of the mine, it was prophesied that the group would be denied a new home by the faithless three times before \"He would open the way,\" which may refer to this historic incident.\n\nThe first time the old woman visited, a guard decided to call the nearby Allegheny Asylum to ask about escaped patients, which places the incident no later than March of 2061. The Cult of the Mothman arrived at the Lucky Hole Mine before the bombs fell on October 23, 2077, and took shelter inside. As nuclear shockwaves ripped across the surface of Appalachia, the group settled into their new home.\n\nMeanwhile, in the years following complete societal collapse, there were frequent reports among the Charleston Emergency Government of people claiming to have seen Mothman. The creature was also documented by the Appalachian Enclave. Jeff Lane was a man obsessed with the paranormal, who moved to Point Pleasant because of the town's historic connection to supernatural events. He lived in an apartment adjacent to the Mothman Museum, a business he either owned or worked for. He had a key to the bathroom of the Museum which concealed the entrance to their hidden chapel. He remained in Point Pleasant after the War, and developed a fixation on an entity called \"the Interloper,\" after encountering a \"story teller\" whom spoke of this entity waiting deep beneath the earth. Jeff described this man as \"mad by any reckoning,\" but held his story to be \"no less true,\" and became convinced that the Interloper was waiting for him. He described the Mothman as a mere \"creature\" and aspired to understand the horrors hidden in the periphery of the subconscious mind. Jeff eventually left Point Pleasant and made his way to the Lucky Hole Mine. By this time, he was completely obsessed with the Interloper, believing it had chosen him for some higher cosmic purpose. He arrived alone, and was unaware that his former neighbors had taken shelter here, though he noted that \"the signs are all around that I am not the only one to hear the call.\" At this time, Lane expressed his desire to act as a \"vessel\" and a \"conduit\" for the Interloper, and his belief that he was specifically ordained for this role. After recording this tape, Jeff Lane disappears from history. Beyond these scant facts, the nature of his relationship with the Interloper and its cult is unknown. In the years following the War, some within the mine \"turned to darker worship\" under the guidance of a figure known as the First Priestess of the Wood. Many of the cultists within the mine began to worship the Firstborn of the Wood, to the disgust of others. When this perceived corruption of the religion became unbearable, a group fled the mine with Charles. They came to call this new sect \"the Enlightened\" and founded a church called the Lantern, somewhere beyond the hills of West Virginia, leaving those who exalted the First Priestess to dwell in the mine.\n\nThe Enlightened define themselves by their exclusive reverence for the Wise Mothman, an individual mothman with magenta eyes. They describe this Wise One as a benevolent mortal messenger who wishes to impart wisdom upon mankind, and does not ask to be treated as a god. By 2088, groups of cultists began to emerge from the mine and settle Appalachia, building shrines in all regions of West Virginia except for the Cranberry Bog. They sought communion with the forces they believed dwelled in the forest. They also attempted to summon or encounter the Mothman and be blessed by his divine power. The cult consisted not only of individuals, but entire family units and communities. Some of their settlements appeared to be hatcheries for feral red-eyed mothmen. They came to call themselves the Followers of the Winged One. They have also been known to refer to themselves, perhaps in certain contexts, as \"brothers of the Wood\" or \"servants of the Wood.\" They seek to become one with \"the Light.\" At some point, the Followers purged their enemies in an event called the Crusade of Light.\n\nThe First Priestess of the Wood eventually died, and her casket was enshrined in the chapel at Lucky Hole Mine, elevated prominently between the pulpit and the springs. A human skull was placed on this casket, neatly arranged with radstag antlers, evoking the form of an antlered human. Those loyal to the Priestess continued to address her and deliver blessings unto her posthumously.\n\nDuring the pre-Plague period, raiders came to control Point Pleasant until power changed hands to the Responders, who eventually fell to the Scorched. A ghastly shrine by the water indicates cult activity in Point Pleasant at some point before or after these events. The Scorched Plague hit Appalachia in 2085. Eventually, all of the faithful left West Virginia or died there. The latest written evidence of human activity in Appalachia dates to 2097. By the time Vault 76 opened in 2102, none remained alive in the region.\n\nIn the wake of the Plague, Mothman stalked the ruins in silence. The cultists' distinctive remains were seen occasionally, especially near their abandoned settlements. Scores of scorched humans and feral ghouls were left milling about the region, but none have ever been spotted wearing cultist attire. When the 76 Dwellers emerged on Reclamation Day, the earliest among them reported seeing a friendly purple-eyed mutant moth in the wild, but sightings ceased by the end of the year. Outside of certain Enlightened summoning rituals, the Wise Mothman has not been spotted in the region since.\n\nOver the next year, various people groups returned or migrated to the region due to the defeat of the Scorchbeast Queen. As they fought viciously to settle the corrupted forests of Appalachia, red eyes fell upon them, and the Mothman disturbed their dreams.\nIn 2103, the Followers of the Winged One returned en masse and thrived in West Virginia. Restored to their holy land, they resolved to drive out or destroy all within His domain who shun the Light of the Holy Mothman. The sect has maintained a mounting presence in Appalachia ever since. They began by fortifying and sanctifying positions across the state, including Clancy Manor, Ingram Mansion, Johnson's Acre, and their ancestral home of Point Pleasant. Shrines of various size can be found in any given forest in the region, and ephemeral ritual bonfires are constructed throughout the woods. Small bands of initiates and aspiring Mothman Priests freely camp in the wilderness by night and wander the country roads by day. High Priests are spotted in the region seasonally, some of them apparently caring for mothman eggs.\n\nThey settled the church at Kanawha County Cemetery, hoping to track down the works of a deceased entomologist by the name of Dr. Wallace. They sought his doctoral thesis on the moths of the Appalachian region. Additionally, a shrine called Blake's Offering appeared very close to the ruins of KMAX Transmission, a student radio station whose host was a conspiracy theorist with a cryptozoological interest in Mothman. During the seasonal Equinox, members of the Enlightened travel to Point Pleasant, driving away the Followers who normally occupy this location. This begins a two-week long ceremony in honor of the Wise One. The Followers attempt to sabotage the hourly rituals throughout the festival, and ultimately reclaim the town each year after the Enlightened leave. During the first festival, a throne was constructed on top of the Mothman Museum. They also attached Hornwright industrial fans to the roof, which they use to disperse neurotoxic dust into the air.\n\nIn 2104, a Follower named Brother Scarberry began socializing with the Dwellers of Vault 76. Meanwhile, a Smiling Man who seemed to have the shadow of a moth was seen wandering the wilderness. Shortly thereafter, the cult settled the Glade in Cranberry Bog, now known as the Sacramental Glade. In 2105, the Followers were found to be living in the sprawling Organ Cave beneath the Forest, and came into conflict with the Responders in the area. Around the same time, they were driven from Ingram Mansion, and their occult structures were cleared away to make room for a new development. Each denomination decries the other as heretical servants of \"the Pretender Mothman.\" The Followers hold their spiritual beliefs to be observable truth. In their parlance, the Enlightened have actually \"left the Light\" in their apostacy from the larger faith. They take great offense that the Enlightened still practice some of the same rituals in the name of a different benefactor.\n\nIn response, the Enlightened describe themselves as students of \"the physical reality of the Mothman,\" and look down on the larger cult as believers in the supernal. In-game spelling, punctuation and/or grammar They scorn these \"Dim Ones\" as heretics projecting mythology onto unthinking creatures, and condemn their red-eyed Holy Mothman icon as \"the Deceiver.\" In the words of the Enlightened, their former peers have \"succumbed to the delusion of Holiness\" in heeding \"the Call of a thing beyond.\" They hold the Wise Mothman to be \"among us, and of us,\" and they claim to \"know that he is more alike to us than not.\"\n\nBoth sects recognize the Mothman Equinox as a sacred cosmological event and claim ownership of the Mothman Museum. Both are interested in psychic phenomena, especially the ability to hear voices and remote viewing, though neither is known to use the word \"psychic.\" The schism formally occurred when a group left the mine with Charles. The First Priestess of the Wood remained at the mine and eventually died there. As Interpreter Michaela tells the story in Exodus, the schism began when the entire cult began to hear the whispers of the Wise Mothman while living at the mine, filling many of them with fear. Conversely, Charles and some of the cultists focused on these whispers, and became \"Wise\" in doing so. Upon learning that the Enlightened still practice traditional Mothman rituals, Brother Scarberry remarks \"It seems that there is the need for another Crusade of Light,\" alluding to some organized campaign of mass violence the Followers once carried out, possibly targeting apostates specifically. The timeframe, location, and parameters of this Crusade of Light are unspecified. On the tape Cultist - Mind's Eye, a Mothman Priest uses the plural \"crusades,\" either alluding to a multitude of previous events or plans for a second Crusade in the future.\n\nSeasonally, the Enlightened wrest control of Point Pleasant from their adversaries for two weeks at a time, to conduct the Equinox festival. The Followers, in turn, attempt to disrupt their ceremonies until the festivities conclude and the Enlightened leave. The timing of the Mothman Equinox may or may not align with equinoxes observed by traditional astronomy.\n\nThe Enlightened recognize and emphasize a distinction between voices associated with the Wise Mothman and those associated with the Interloper. The Followers are known to celebrate auditory hallucinations as \"His voice\" and \"the voices of the Woods.\" The Followers of the Winged One are numerous throughout Appalachia and the surrounding regions. They impede trade between other societies by maintaining territorial control over trade routes.\n\nThey have been recruiting individuals who were not at the Lucky Hole Mine at the time of the Great War. Ghouls are commonly seen among their ranks. The cult is stable enough that people have been born into it, and grown to adulthood in social isolation. Their structure includes Mothman Priests who preside over the disciples, as well as High Priests who have memorized sacred books, and other revered elders. Their society emphasizes the importance of crusades.\n\nThe Enlightened are only known to live at a mysterious church called the Lantern. The highest rank of their secular society is to be called Wise. These Wise persons work in tandem with Interpreters, who oversee the basic Observers and guide them in visions. Unlike their infamously territorial counterparts, this smaller, more secretive sect are not known to disrupt other wasteland societies, and seem to have gone almost entirely unnoticed in general. The Followers appear to value primitivism, using a combination of wood, bones, wire, leather, vines, and cloth to construct their armor and shrines. Their bases usually utilize pre-existing structures, modifying them with bones, vines, wood, and otherwise to create shelters, balconies, and altars. Their places of influence are overwhelmingly infested with overgrown roots and vines.\n\nSome strongholds, such as Sacrament and Moth-Home, appear to be newly assembled from natural materials. Nearly all of their settlements are built around a prominent spire, where mothmen can perch. Sometimes a human sacrifice is bound and offered up on the spire. The creatures do frequently visit these settlements at night, and almost exclusively leave their eggs in the care of the cultists. The distinctive bones of a large aquatic creature are universal to cultist architecture. The nature of this creature is unknown, but the remains of one rest underwater at the Big Maw. The cranium of this beast is commonly used to construct an effigy of the Holy Mothman. Glowing red mushrooms, berries, or candles are often placed in the eye sockets. In 2103, the Followers reclaimed Kanawha County Cemetery. They apparently guided the roots of a large tree to rapidly grow towards the church and infest the building. As the church broke apart, they reinforced the structure with massive animal bones and tangled roots, in support of a central spire. Kanawha remains a major cultist settlement, and church services are held in the desecrated stronghold. The Followers can still be seen holding mass at the Kanawha church, as well as the church within the Lucky Hole Mine. They also occupy and meditate within original Mothman church in Point Pleasant. They are especially interested in reclaiming pre-War churches, such as the ones at Helvetia and the Swallowed Town, as well as historical estates such as Clancy Manor and Ingram Mansion.\n\nRecently-founded camps such as the one at Old Mold Quarry may make their presence known with simple canvas tents, torches, stakes, and a central bonfire. Blake's Offering is a large camp in the process of being fortified.\n\nWhen the Followers reclaimed Point Pleasant from the Scorched, they wove roots through the wreckage of the North Road Bridge, converting it into an enclosed worship space. The mutilated body of a Scorched hangs from a beam of lumber jutting over the entrance, Their totems are generally shaped from roots growing out of the ground, intertwined with human and animal bones. Most feature a single triangle prominently scratched into their surface or assembled from twigs. They also fashion sconces, chandeliers, and other strange displays purely out of human bones. At Kanawha County Cemetery, a cultist can be seen tending to an opened grave beneath a headstone (separate from the tomb of Dr. Wallace), indicating some of these remains are obtained by robbing graveyards. Cultist paraphernalia also exists at the cemetery above Hopewell Cave.\n\nIn 2102, these totems could be found in the chapel beneath the Mothman Museum. It's unclear if they were present before the War, nor how the human remains may have been obtained. A key to the chapel is found at Wilson Bros Auto, where another totem is found, with a post-War animal sacrifice laying at its base. When the Followers reclaimed Point Pleasant in 2103, they spread the vines to infest the entire town, and erected several new totems. In 2104, they elevated crucified remains beneath signs reading \"abandon hope,\" creating Totems of Warding which the Enlightened find disturbing. Nearly all of these effigies are topped with antlered radstag skulls, or the skulls of humans or brahmin affixed with tree limbs positioned to resemble antlers. Strangely, some appear to incorporate the skulls of gazelles, ibexes, or other creatures which are not known to live in the area, though they could have plausibly acquired these through trade, looting, or hunting in other territories. Some were fashioned from pre-war taxidermy, evidenced by fine wooden plaques. One variety of skull seen mounted at the Sacramental Glade and Organ Cave resembles a sheepsquatch, but not a sheepsquatch skull, and may have belonged to a mutant ram. The skull of a sheepsquatch or brahmin rests on a prominent casket at the Glade, much like the antlered skull laid on the coffin of the First Priestess. One totem in the Forest seems to distort light around it. Some specific shrines are marked by strange ambient audio, or the sudden absence of normal ambient audio such as wind and wildlife. Their \"bone-tree\" totems are very similar to those built by the Swampfolk of Point Lookout. As they typically feature antlers, they could be likened to a verdant stag. A unique totem seen in the Organ Cave features a fresh red eyeball set into the right socket of an off-center human skull, crowning a tangle of roots which has bloomed through the left. Shelf mushrooms grow at its base. Chems are commonly found at cultist settlements. Buffout is most abundant, and a chalkboard in the Lucky Hole Mine suggests putting buffout in a syringe. In the chapel beneath the Mothman Museum, there is a chem within the pulpit, and in the side room. At the waterfront prayer circle in Point Pleasant, a cultist kneels with a random chem placed directly in front of them. Hallucigen gas canisters can be found near ritual spaces at Moth-Home and Hopewell cemetery, and could formerly be found at Ingram Mansion. Cultists also appear to drink coffee and beer.\n\nThe Enlightened use neurotoxic dust gathered from mothmen in their ceremonies, and believe it allows the imbiber to \"see the world through His eyes.\" In Observations, the visions of an observer named Dave are dismissed due to their unusual nature and his heavy chem use. The dwellers of the Lucky Hole Mine were able to survive because an underground spring formed in the main chamber. The spring was not always present. The cultists believe it was created by their god when He gathered their tears in His branches and spread them upon the earth. The cultists at the Organ Cave drink from the blood-red water of the underground river, which may be the result of a natural iron deposit.\n\nSoup is a staple of their diet. Underground, the cultists pick glowing mushrooms and cook them into stew. They also eat canned soups. The door guards of the Lucky Hole Mine may occasionally produce a large bowl of noodles and eat it standing up, as will revelers at Clancy Manor. The manor's kitchen is littered with a remarkable abundance of large pots, several of them filled with stew. Bowls of chicken noodle soup and vegetable medley soup can be found on tables here.\n\nAt their settlements, they hunt wild game, including radstags. Salt and sugar can be found at most cultist locations. Some also have spices. Although the Followers routinely capture and ostensibly butcher humans for ritual purposes, there is no clear evidence of them directly eating human meat. However, the Enlightened Observer Errol loudly implies a singular fascination with hunting individuals shown to him in visions and eating them. Both sects fill troughs with albino radstag blood as a ritual offering to the Mothman. These blood troughs are generally wrapped in barbed wire, moss, or roots. In one blood trough on the North Road Bridge, a mass of bloodbug meat has been placed, and the hides of radstags and foxes rest at the foot of the altar. Additionally, the troughs throughout Point Pleasant are wrapped in moss which pulsates with a red glow.\n\nLive humans are offered upon the spire at Moth-Home. The cultists who tend to the Interloper seem to engage in rituals involving bloodletting, but the specifics of this are entirely unclear. Jars litter the creature's lair, and a sickle can be found there.\n\nErrol attempts to sacrifice humans to the Wise One, who has repeatedly rejected the offering. The Enlightened also present diverse arrangements of produce and flora to the Wise Mothman. A strangler pod grows within one of their offering baskets. The Followers of the Winged One believe that in death, the Holy Mothman will shepherd them into a divine, eternal Light. They fear the Mothman as a god. They believe He is attracted to light, as well as the glow of radiation. They are known to refer to the Holy Mothman with a capitalized He pronoun, and sometimes honor Him as the Great Moth or the Bright One. They seem to use numerous varied titles for their mythological figures. Very little is known about the nature of their god or gods, and what their different titles might signify. One note found at Blake's Offering begins by invoking two distinct figures; \"bright winged one sleeps beneath the earth/the silent watching one sleeps beneath the sea.\" The Followers extensively mythologize and deify various aspects of nature. They deeply revere the flora of Appalachia, and believe they are in direct contact with an entity they call \"the Wood\" or \"the Woods,\" almost always capitalized, which they believe to have multiple voices and which brings them gifts in exchange for sacrificial offerings, including other humans. They also invoke this entity as \"The Eyes of the Forest,\" \"father of the Woods,\" and \"the Harvester.\" They endeavor to \"Grow out to Him.\" They worship Him at holy springs and even commit ritual suicide by imbibing poisoned drinks. They assign great spiritual significance to the entity's blood and the blood of the Firstborn of the Wood. The cult offers the \"gift of the woods\" to the faithful,[ and some cultists aspire to become a \"child of the wood\" themselves. The Followers of the Winged One were guided in their worship of this deity by a figure known as the First Priestess of the Wood.\n\nAt the pulpit of the converted church in Point Pleasant, a pencil can be found next to a ruined book, perhaps emphasizing the improvisational nature of their belief system.\n\nThe Enlightened dismiss the Followers' mythology, and preach only the importance of developing one's personal understanding of the Truth of the Wise Mothman. Both sects practice human sacrifice, though Observer Errol is confounded as to why the Wise One always leaves \"when they begin to scream.\"",

            "constant": false,
            "content": "The Responders are a volunteer disaster relief organization operating in Appalachia. Formed shortly after the Great War by local first responder units, they were dedicated to helping local communities survive. To this end, they instituted a variety of programs that ranged from basic outdoor survival training to a specialized combat division called the Fire Breathers.\n\nLike the other regional factions, the original Responders were wiped out by the Scorched Plague. Several years later, those who reclaimed Appalachia began to reform the Responders. A desire to revive the group began with Heather Ellis in Flatwoods. Later, in 2104, the Responders group re-established itself in the Whitespring Resort, led by Rucker. In the aftermath of the Great War, first responders in Appalachia mobilized to help their fellow citizens. Eventually becoming a unified group known as the \"Responders\", they encompassed government and crisis relief duties in Appalachia, providing automated survival training to those who needed it. Their goals included helping people who made it through the nuclear holocaust or were born after the dust had settled, as surviving in the post-War world became paramount. They set up numerous locations across West Virginia in a bid to establish some semblance of law and order. The West Virginian capital of Charleston became the heart of Appalachian reconstruction with the Responders at the forefront, the city itself showing great promise of rebuilding in the aftermath of the Great War.  Among these refugees desperate for help were those from the Pleasant Valley Ski Resort, far away in the Savage Divide; left without help, they banded together under one David Thorpe. Thorpe rallied them into what would be the first of the region's raider warbands - and what would soon be a major threat to the Responders' mission. Weathering post-War hardships, the Responders held steady, despite the new threat of the raiders. The city of Charleston grew with its success and proved to be a safe haven against raider attacks. However, that was to change by 2082; a raiding party led by Rosalynn Jeffries, David Thorpe's lover, was routed handily by the Responders, despite some casualties. Most importantly, some raiders were captured alive - Rosalynn among them. With a powerful bargaining chip, the Responders hoped that they could negotiate some sort of ceasefire in exchange for their prisoners. Thorpe, on the other hand, was convinced that Rosalynn was dead. In a sheer display of cruelty, on Christmas morning, the Summersville Dam was rigged with mini nukes on Thorpe's order. The subsequent destruction of the dam resulted in catastrophic flooding that killed countless Responders, refugees, and other innocents. The survivors resettled at the Morgantown Airport. Despite the devastation, the Responders did not give up. Morgantown proved to be a jackpot, as after containing the trouble with the local gangs, they had a centrally-located base, distance between them and the nearest raider clans in the mountains, and contact with the Free States and the Appalachian Brotherhood of Steel. They also expanded into Flatwoods  and began restarting some of the old infrastructures in the town to produce food and provide security. Their access to food, medicine, and other essential supplies was the foundation of their relationship with the Free States and the Brotherhood, with caravans crossing through the Savage Divide regularly. Four years after the flood, in January 2086, they reached the apex of their power and influence as they fought against the super mutants in Huntersville alongside power-armored troops of Paladin Taggerdy. The victory seemed to signal the beginning of a new era for Appalachia, as the Responders and Brotherhood forged an alliance and their patrols even managed to suppress the mountain raiders.  Sanjay Kumar and Miguel Caldera were indispensable for maintaining the fleet and keeping it operational. However, things would not go their way. The Enclave, hidden away from prying eyes, split apart in the civil war after President Thomas Eckhart decided to have his way and force the automated security systems to raise the DEFCON level by releasing scorchbeasts on Appalachia, after subjecting it to Chinese drones, the Huntersville mutants, and other monstrosities. The civil war that destroyed the faction set the scorchbeasts loose, which rapidly infested the Cranberry Bog and started spreading out into the adjacent areas. The appearance of the Scorched was a shock to all survivors who came into contact with them, as was the plague they spread. The Responders decided to fight back, organizing a special fighting force called the Fire Breathers using the experience of Melody Larkin and Hank Madigan, a Brotherhood deserter, to train and organize the elite fighters. They would face the horrors of the wasteland and protect the lands west of Appalachia from the Scorched, encountering strange hostile creatures along the way. However, the Responders failed to consider the big picture. Maria Chavez, their de facto leader, did not believe the threat was as severe as the Brotherhood made it out to be and disliked their militarism and repeated demands for supplies. What just a few years earlier promised to be a long-lasting alliance was unraveling fast, culminating on March 12, 2095, when the Brotherhood demanded information about Amy Kerry's project. At gunpoint. Although Chavez relented, the relations were soured permanently. The fall of the Brotherhood in August 2095 left the Responders alone on the board and it was a matter of time until the scorchbeasts finally took them out. The raiders, desperately fleeing the Savage Divide, swept through the Forest, taking out many of the Responder outposts, including Flatwoods.\n\nThe research project into a Scorched vaccine at AVR Medical Center was launched too late to provide a cure in time to protect the Fire Breathers. By September 2096, all of the pieces were in place to create it, but communications breakdowns due to constant Scorched attacks prevented Dr. Hudson from completing it and the Fire Breathers were forced to launch their operation to seal the Big Bend Tunnel and buy time for Appalachia without it. The operation took place in late October and failed. So did Hank Madigan on his attempt to establish the Scorched Detection System developed in conjunction with the Free States, captured and killed by the raiders. Finally, Morgantown Airport fell after a desperate defense against hordes of scorchbeasts and their minions on November 7, 2096. The Responders were wiped out. By 2103, however, as people came back to Appalachia, Heather Ellis, who had returned with the Settlers, moved to Flatwoods, discovered the history of the Responders, and decided to revive the group and their efforts by becoming one herself, continuing to live in Flatwoods with her dog Chloe and wearing the Responders paramedic jumpsuit to show her support to revive the group. Another woman, Tiffany Brantley, decided to join the elite Fire Breathers and is with Vendor bot Mack and the firefighter Protectrons at the Charleston Fire Department, already suited up in her Fire Breather uniform, currently stuck on having to take the exam. Around 2104, a woman named Rucker returned to Appalachia and found some of these people wearing the Responders uniform. Rucker researched the history of the original Responders by finding people who could tell her about the old group and expressed a desire to truly re-form the Responders. Rucker helped the ideals of the original Responders grow, reviving the faction and eventually needing to set up a permanent base. With waves of refugees coming to Appalachia, the new Responders needed a large place suitable to treating and housing the refugees. They eventually established themselves at the seemingly abandoned Whitespring Resort, turning it into a refuge. After setting up shop, they received the assistance of the enigmatic Orlando, who claims to be a liaison between the resort's \"Management\" and the Responders. During this time, the new Responders also managed to find and repair a vertibird, which allowed them to explore and help the regions outside of the Appalachian wasteland. One of the first groups they contacted were the Union, a group of survivors found in the ruins of Pittsburgh, now known as \"The Pitt\" following the Great War. Orlando and the Management provided the Responders with Ultracells as fuel to fly the vertibird. The original Responders had a decentralized, horizontal structure designed to address the needs of people under their care and aid them in need. Regular supply trains were established between the nearby farms and the Responder headquarters, with full members assigned to their protection, such as Jerry Abernathy. For rapid response in emergencies, the Responders also established an emergency response team, trained by Felix O'Dell and consisting of Derek Castle (guard and escort), Veronica Chang and Kevin Trayjor (field medics). In the early years, Responders largely operated under their pre-existing chains of command (police, paramedics, firefighters, etc.), ignoring attempts by the Charleston Emergency Government to assert their leadership over them. However, this early structure was far from unified and required a good deal of tact and diplomacy to keep them from falling apart. This problem was exposed less than a year after the war, when the responders grappled with the problem of Chief Mayfield's heavy-handed rule of Morgantown. After he ordered his police officers to open fire on the rebellious VTU students and imposed a mandatory curfew, Melody Larkin realized that moving on him would risk splitting law enforcement Responders from the organization. After relocating operations to Morgantown Airport, the faction was effectively guided by five senior members: Maria Chavez (senior Responder and de facto leader), Claire Hudson (chief medical officer), Sanjay Kumar (chief engineer), Melody Larkin (combat trainer), and Jeff Nakamura (quartermaster). However, the division of labor was handled on a merit basis, with the senior Responders working together with junior members. The Fire Breathers combat unit was a notable exception, operating with a strict chain of command under Melody, as a matter of necessity.\n\nThe reformed Responders at the Whitespring Refuge are decentralized much in the same way as the original group was, with their main focus being on helping others. Rucker, who led the effort to revive the group, is de facto in charge of the new Responders, though she rejects being labeled as a singular leader.\nSenior Responders: The de facto leadership of the organization, typically people who have been with the organization since the beginning.\nResponders: Fully trained members of the faction who each had a job, a specialty, and housing assignment. The job of Responders was to help everyone, including volunteers and candidates.\nFire Breathers: An elite combat unit specializing in fighting in toxic areas of the wasteland, especially the Ash Heap.\nVolunteers: People who underwent the automated training, enjoying weekly rations from the self-serve kiosks, access to the Forest Watch and other Responder communications, and a discount at the official vendors. Like Responders, volunteers also had jobs, specialties, and housing assignments. Survivors registered to become volunteers with a Responder or at the self-serve registration kiosk. Survivors and candidates became volunteers by participating in two experiments and/or training sessions.\nVolunteer Candidates who are undergoing training (whether automated or under another Responder), or are too young to become Volunteers or Responders. At the age of 13, candidates could be promoted. While candidates were assigned housing, they were not assigned jobs or specialties.",

            "comment": "Atlantic City Municipal Government",
            "constant": false,
            "content": "The Atlantic City Municipal Government is a major faction in Atlantic City, representing its civilian government. They are called Munis for short, a term coined by the Lombardi Family and the Showmen. It is one of the few actual governments in the region, responsible for everything necessary for the survival of Acee. Although the post-War municipal government is rooted in the historical government of Atlantic City (incorporated in 1854), it is actually a new incarnation borne out of necessity. Atlantic City was originally led by Carly Day, a career politician who relied on a cadre of professional administrators to keep the city running itself. Their hard work ensured smooth sailing and landslide wins in elections every four years for Day, who was left with only one question: Enjoying her free time in office. She dismissed the looming threat of nuclear war as just \"hullabaloo,\" and the Great War blindsided her. Following the devastating floods and destruction, the people of Atlantic City expected her to lead, something she proved incapable of with just a fraction of her staff remaining. The city had enough food stockpiled for several months and she instituted strict rationing to stretch them out. However, Day took no steps to address the issue, simply coasting along. By February next year, rations started to thin out, with unrest spreading and her staff either leaving or dying. Day found herself bowing to the Atlantic City mob, which promised to take care of any unrest. The rations finally ran out in May (apart from Day's personal supply), which meant hunger for Atlantic City, especially since the bottle caps started circulating and pre-War money the city had in spades became worthless. Day turned to the mafia to secure food supplies by strongarming farms on the city's outskirts. Carly remained isolated from city affairs, ignoring the warnings of her secretary, Jim Harrison, who tried his best to wake her up to the fact that the people of Atlantic City were starving. His warnings went unheeded, leading to a string of further resignations.  Even when Jim begged her to share her reserve to ensure his daughter would still have a father, she ignored him. Things came to a head in February 2085, with Atlantic City driven into the ground. There was no electricity for the common people, water was contaminated, and starvation was widespread. Worse yet, the mob was operating unopposed, and farms were regularly raided to collect foodstuffs for guests of the Casino Quarter. Eventually, they made the mistake of visiting Timothy Lane and his wife, Frieda Lane, to collect. Rather than acquiesce, Timothy fought back and shot their entire raiding party save one. The mob did not expect this development and offered no resistance as the Lanes marched on the city hall, confronting Mayor Day after the sole survivor revealed how bad the situation got. The official version is that Timothy made her leave the city, though in truth Timothy shot her. Together with other like-minded citizens of Acee, Lane and his wife reorganized the municipal government and brought some semblance of order to Atlantic City over the next twenty years. Frieda's know-how about purifying soil to sustain crops was instrumental. Since then, the Lanes have continued the thankless, but necessary task of keeping the city running, with the Lombardi Family and the Showmen constantly angling for some way to coerce them to do their bidding or outright get rid of them. While there is a constant struggle for influence, the two groups are too disorganized and focused on entertainment and pleasure to pose a real threat. The worst they can usually do is petty jabs and coining \"Muni\" as a shorthand for the government. The Munis don't really care, preoccupied with the bigger picture. By 2105, Atlantic City has become one of the most prosperous cities of the East, with the Lanes turning the city around. The Munis played and continue to play an extremely important role, ensuring that everyone in the city is provided with food, water, electricity, and protection from outside threats, such as the newly emerged Overgrown. While the pressures of governance have left their mark, as does the age,  both Lanes seem to be happy to do the job - especially since they're atypical politicians. Especially Frieda, who disdains rubbing elbows in favor of applying elbow grease. Other members of the Munis think highly of both, especially Mayor Lane, seeing the Munis as the pillar that keeps Atlantic City from backsliding. Both the Showmen and the mafia are the other two pillars. Rather than fight them, Lane decided on an uneasy alliance, with the Munis providing governance and keeping the city running with everything it needed to prosper, while the mob and the Showmen provided entertainment and kept the peace to attract tourists and especially caravans to the town. While the compromise might seem surprising, Mayor Lane considered it a pragmatic choice: Atlantic City was a place of vice and sin, and the best he could hope for was making it into a civilized hell. The pragmatic policy has served him and the city well over the years, and even won him some secret admirers among the mob. The tension is still present, and on occasion results in clashes. The worst happen when the mobsters or Showmen try to weasel their way out of paying taxes, which raises the ire of Buttercup, Lane's head of IRS and a terrifying presence. The Munis fight the biggest fights in Atlantic City,  and the greatest problem in recent years has been the grind that put a real strain on their ability to keep the peace and protect everyone. Especially with the emergence of the Overgrown.",

            "constant": false,
            "content": "The Enlightened, or the Wise Mothman's Enlightened, are a religious faction who do not live in Appalachia, but travel there seasonally to hold a summoning ceremony. The group was formed when some members of the pre-War Cult of the Mothman rejected the post-War developments of the religion, and fled the state together. They have since come to exclusively revere the purple-eyed Wise Mothman, but do not worship him as a god. After an attempt by the Cult of the Mothman to summon their benefactor on October 22, 2077, it was proclaimed by an unknown preacher that the member known as Brother Charles had received a vision from the Mothman in the periphery of his senses, which foretold of an impending flood, and advised the cult to seek high ground. The Enlightened now believe Charles' revelations were the Whispers of the Wise Mothman, and recount the omen as a warning of \"fire and flood.\" Heeding this omen, the Cult of the Mothman crossed the state to the cliffs overlooking Watoga, to take shelter in the depths of Lucky Hole Mine. No contemporary evidence exists of who suggested this specific destination or why, but in modern times, the Enlightened claim it was Brother Charles who guided his brethren to the safety of the mine. Some contingency of the Cult of the Mothman set out from Point Pleasant with Brother Charles in tow, and arrived at the Lucky Hole Mine before the bombs fell on October 23. Jeff Lane, a cult affiliate who worked at the Mothman Museum, remained in Point Pleasant after the war. He arrived some time later,  raving about a being he called \"the Interloper.\" The Mine features two major chambers of worship; a large church area, where a natural spring of drinking water has formed, and the hidden chamber where a large creature is worshipped. Both are marked by giant sculptures of faces which appear to have been excavated from deep beneath the earth. In modern times, standing near the creature produces an audible hum. While trapped here by the fallout, some of them \"turned to darker worship,\" and communed with a being they called \"Firstborn of the Wood\" under the guidance of a woman known as the First Priestess of the Wood,  a development which disgusted others among the group.\n\nDuring this time in the mine, according to the Enlightened, the entire cult began to hear whispers, which filled many of them with fear. Conversely, Charles and some of the cultists continued to listen to his whispers, and became \"Wise\" in doing so. Complicating this narrative, a note at the mine celebrates the First Priestess for enabling them to hear \"His voice.\" Some Mothman cultists considered the group's new practices to be an unbearable corruption of their religion, and fled the mine. Many were not prepared to behold the post-apocalyptic world. As the Enlightened recount in Exodus, some among them despaired, and urged Charles to \"reject the Truth\" and return to the safety of the mine. However, Charles spoke of a far away place, which he envisioned as a \"beacon of safety,\" and a \"home for those that had heard the Truth and been Enlightened.\" After a long and dangerous journey, they reached their new home, where they founded their church and named it the Lantern, in hopes that it might serve as a shining beacon against \"the ignorance of the world.\" They came to refer to those who remained at the Lucky Hole Mine as the \"Dim Ones.\" That group eventually came to call themselves \"the Followers of the Winged One,\" and would later be seen protecting the eggs of red-eyed mothmans and accompanying mothman hatchlings in combat. The group remain headquartered at their church, the Lantern. Its location is a secret which has so far been successfully withheld from the people of Appalachia, though it is presumed to be somewhere outside of the state.\n\nA group consisting of Wise Charles the Forewarned, Interpreter Clarence, and Observers Errol, Johanna, and Marlon, returned to Point Pleasant in 2104. This pilgrimage was taken to commune with the Wise Mothman during the Mothman Equinox, when he is most powerful. They have since returned twice, celebrating the Equinox as a seasonal festival. The Enlightened think of themselves blessed by the Wise Mothman's Truth, which they deem to be a lesson, a warning, and the path to enlightenment, all at once. They consider themselves students of wisdom. Integral to each member's path to enlightenment is the ability to hear the Wise Mothman's whispers, and to listen, that they might transcend the limits of human understanding. To a certain extent, the group also possesses knowledge of either astronomy or astrology, which they have obtained from listening to the Wise Mothman. The group is welcoming to those ignorant of the Truth, as they consider ignorance to be the first step on the path to enlightenment. The path to enlightenment involves several stages of learning, each of which is tied to a rank. Members of the first rank are dubbed Observers, signifying they have become aware of their ignorance, and are likened to the larva of a moth. The second rank, the Interpreters, are like the pupa, as they surround themselves in a cocoon of the Wise One's words, and cast form from them. Their highest title, Wise, is reserved for those few who break free from their cocoon like a moth, and become truly Enlightened. The Enlightened exclusively recognize the transcendence of the magenta-eyed Wise Mothman, which they consider a single sacred, yet mortal, being. They are known to call him \"the Wise One\" and, occasionally, \"Papa.\" They believe Charles' vision on October 22, 2077 was granted by the Wise One, indicating that they believe he was somehow active before the War. They summon the Wise One at a seasonal equinox, which involves the inhalation of hallucinogenic neurotoxic dust gathered somehow from Mothman. They believe this grants the imbiber the opportunity to experience Truth first hand, by enabling them to \"see the world through his eyes.\" This is accompanied by one's sense of hearing becoming distorted, and the ability to clearly hear Interpreter Clarence's voice over great distance during the ceremony.\n\nThe Enlightened appear to respect the voices which wrack the mind of Observer Marlon. According to these voices, inhaling the neurotoxic dust for a prolonged period of time may prove to be harmful. The cultists also deeply admire Wise Charles for his condition; though blind and non-responsive, his cranium has visibly swollen to accommodate his expanding mind, and his eyes have begun to glow.\n\nThe Enlightened widely attempt to engage in the psychic practice of remote viewing, and record the results in a series of texts simply titled Observations, in a practice comparable to keeping a community dream journal.\n\nErrol expresses confusion that the Wise Mothman always departs when his sacrificial victims begin to scream. He entertains the theories that his own unworthiness or the unworthiness of his victims is what offends the Wise One. Looking back on the pre-War Cult of the Mothman, the Enlighten consider them misguided followers of the red-eyed pretender, despite Charles' presence among them.  However, they believe Charles' precognition (and by extension the survival of the cult) was granted by the Wise Mothman.  Additionally, Observer Errol refers to the Mothman Museum as the Wise One's Museum, which suggests they reclaim the cultural legacy of the Museum as pertinent to the Wise Mothman, despite their denouncement of the cult headquartered there at the time of the War. The preacher who proclaimed Charles' omen on the eve of the War testified that the Mothman warned only of \"flood,\" but as the Enlightened recount the event in Exodus, the Wise Mothman warned Charles of \"fire and flood.\" In the first passage of Sayings of Interpreter Alicia, Interpreter James proclaims that the Wise Mothman is, was, and will be, \"Before the Flood, before the Fire, [and] before the Dim Ones.\" Conspicuously, Flood and Fire are capitalized. Elsewhere in this text, the terms Truth, Doom, \"the Ignorant\" (collective), \"a God,\" Vision, Listen, Hear, Observe, Interpret/Interpretation, and Enlightenment are also capitalized, signifying that these concepts all somehow qualify as proper nouns to them.\n\nThe Enlightened refer to their former brethren as \"The Dim Ones,\"  and completely reject red-eyed Mothman (known as the \"Holy Mothman\" to its worshippers) as animalistic harbingers of a malicious non-human entity. They consider all mothmen except for the Wise One to be interchangeable feral creatures. However, they also personify this red-eyed mothman icon as a \"pretender\" and, formally, \"the Deceiver.\" At the Equinox festival, perfect mothman eggs are deposited in a shrine called the Cradle of the Pretenders, indicating \"Pretenders\" is a term which can refer to red-eyed mothmen in multiplicity. The deployment of the phrase \"The Deceiver Mothman and his Progeny\" in False Gods of Appalachia may indicate that they consider these creatures to be the offspring of a specific \"fire-eyed\" mothman.\n\nThe Enlightened consider themselves critical of superstitious and worshipful practices, and hold the Dim Ones' belief system to be outrageously superstitious and heretical. Charles is the only character known to have been among the original group who left the Lucky Hole Mine. All other characters may plausibly have been within the mine or joined later. Wise Hilary the Scourge and Wise Pearl the Augur make claims in their tomes related to events within the mine, but do not specify whether they witnessed these things firsthand.",

            "constant": false,
            "content": "The Blood Eagles are a brutal raider faction who formed in Appalachia in 2103. Due to their unnecessary violence and merciless systems of internal control, the Blood Eagles were not among the gangs who formed the coalition of Crater Raiders, and the two groups are hostile to each other. The Blood Eagles' origins are somewhat conflicted, and a source of rumor among Appalachian wastelanders. Some claim that they originated from old biker gangs, with no desires to make friends with anyone in the wasteland. However, Beckett, a former member of the gang, says that they were formed by a tattered group of con-men and other criminals. Soon, a malevolent clique formed within the gang and quickly siezed control from the inside out. These ruthless opportunists still rule as the gang's current leadership.\n\nSince then, they have become a cruel and sadistic army of raiders who are the largest hostile force in Appalachia as of 2103, staking a claim on most of the Ash Heap, Savage Divide, and Cranberry Bog. Repurposing many of the old raider camps littering the region, their massive numbers and high-tech weaponry make them a consistent thorn in the side of everyone who isn't with them.\n\nThey often prey on Blue Ridge Caravan Company trading parties coming through Big Bend Tunnel, and will do anything to stop them from coming through their territory. By 2103, a gang led by a woman named Dagger had moved into a den in the Mire, and they began extorting Jennie Brown's village for supplies.\n\nIn another incident, a group led by another woman, Tally Lang, stormed into Vault 96, trailing some Hellcats and looking to loot the vault. The group included Needles, Eightball and Dillo. Their actions led to the death of Woods and many mercenaries. Tally's group accidentally became locked in.\n\nIn 2104, the Rust Eagles began holding gladiatorial combat in the Metal Dome. Vault Dwellers and Brotherhood warriors willingly participated in exchange for supplies.\n\nIn early 2105, some Blood Eagles moved into a shack in the far northeast corner of Appalachia, where they appear to be domesticating mirelurks. They also repelled an attack by burrowing mole miners within the deserted mine beneath the Crosshair. The Blood Eagles are othered by the coalition of Crater Raiders due to their propensity for hyperviolence. They revel in violence and bloodshed, and generally attack on sight, with little regard for their own safety, as laid out in their gang code. Any Eagle can climb up the hierarchy by formally challenging more higher ranking members in a game of their choosing. These games are taken seriously, even if the game of choice is an actual tabletop game, and no cheating will be tolerated. A \"best 2 out of 3\" rule determines the winner for non-lethal games. If the loser is the higher ranking member, they must step down willingly or they will be executed if still alive.\n\nThey are led by a triumvirate of three powerful raider leaders: The Blood, the Eye, and the Claw; this allows the Eagles to survive if one, or even two of their leaders are killed, as there will always be the last of the trio alive to rebuild. The rank of Blood, Eye, or Claw are earned and override the specific names of any leader. Thanks to the anarchic nature of their gang, leaders are often challenged and rarely have long lifespans. They recruit members through capitalizing on their addictions. They will actively monitor chem addicts, offer them a spiked, highly addictive dose of Buffout, and withhold the drug from the victim unless they pledge to join. Sometimes, they'll even capture non-addicts and force them to ingest the pills, just to trap them into their ranks.\n\nMost of the time, members are not in a state of lucidity, on account of all the chems. Those who achieve sobriety cannot enjoy it for long: anyone among the group showing signs of clarity or strong will is in danger of being singled out and publicly tortured, leaving the victim disfigured or dead. They exhibit an unparalleled affinity towards taming and hacking, often using robots and attack dogs to further fill their legion. The entire Watoga Underground robotic security detail was hacked and put under Blood Eagle control, including Assaultrons and Mister Gutsies, and they will regularly send tamed dogs and mongrels into battle as the forward scouts and diversions, while the humans close the gap. Beginning in 2105, they have been seen taming mirelurks.\n\nBlood Eagle camps are equipped with alarm systems, so if a member gets attacked or detects an intruder and manages to reach the alarm to activate it, all Blood Eagles in the camp are alerted and engage the threat until the alarm stops or they lose sight of the target for an extended period of time. The alarm also sends out Blood Eagle attack dogs to engage the intruder as well. Leaders of Blood Eagle camps can sometimes be seen wearing a power armor chassis with unique raider power armor painted in Blood Eagle colors on it. Blood Eagles generally wear black leather jackets, and many wear facepaint. When idle, they may listen to the radio or play the banjo.\n\nThey can be seen butchering radstags for meat at several settlements. Others are more focused on cannibalism.",

Aries has paid Clyde to assist in an investigation of the Blue Devil's origins. In particular, Aries is interested in finding a Blue Devil with \"white on it\" and wants to track down and hunt a mother Blue Devil. Although Clyde's investigation does not name a specific species the Blue Devil originated from, he says that \"they\" used to be bred for racing and then fighting before the Great War. This continued after the bombs dropped, but Clyde has not fully determined a reason for the Blue Devil's immense size compared to other canine-like creatures. Clyde goes on to say that the size \"could have something to do with that place, and what's near by,\" though the note does not clarify what \"that place\" is. Clyde notes that Blue Devils are reproducing in the wild, but most pups are not healthy enough to survive. However, those that do survive grow very quickly and are hostile even at a young age. As for the coloration of the creature, Blue Devils typically have dark black hair that appears bluish under certain lighting conditions. However, none of the creatures Clyde surveyed had white hair as Aries suggested. Blue Devils stand on two legs.",

Descended from the Indian brahman cattle variant imported to the U.S. for crossbreeding purposes, they developed two heads as a result of irradiation. These toasty brown critters were quickly adopted by survivors as the most versatile and capable livestock animal in the wastes. Their major advantage is the fact that while ornery, they are actually easy to manage with as little as a pointy stick.\n\nA large, two-headed mutant used as a pack animal, capable of carrying up to 500 lbs. Brahmin also provide milk, and their feces are an efficient fertilizer and fuel for fires. When slaughtered, they become even more useful as source of meat, leather (tough and durable, fit for everything including tents, clothes, armor, belts, saddle bags, shoes), bones (which can be fashioned into clubs, tools, dice, hoes, arrowheads), tails (perfect as brushes), and even fat for soap making. They also don't need much to survive, as they can go without water for extended periods of time and can subsist on whatever weeds they find in the arid wasteland, digesting them in eight-compartment stomachs (double the number compared to pre-War cows).\n\nThese advantages made them the cornerstone of many a post-nuclear economy, including the New California Republic, whose vast brahmin herds are the driving force of its industry and the influence of the powerful brahmin barons. By extension, they also fuel the economy of parasites, such as New Reno during the 2240s, when cattle rustling brought much needed income to the crime families of the city.",

            "content": "The \"gulpers\" found on the East Coast were originally amphibious salamanders that were altered by both the nuclear fallout of the Great War as well as the persistent radioactive phenomenon known as the Fog covering the Island. These creatures grow exponentially over their lifespans, with the oldest ones towering over most humans. The East Coast gulpers are mutated hellbender salamanders. One of the rare creatures found on the islands of Maine, they are ferocious and territorial, similar to deathclaws. Gulpers roam both the shores and the inland areas of the Island, at times hanging on trees in order to take their victims by surprise. They can also slide through swamps and hide underwater, where they are commonly found.\n\nIn Appalachia, gulpers can be found throughout the Mire and the Cranberry Bog. They stand with a hunched back, upright on their hind legs when moving slowly or standing still. They run using all four legs and are able to outrun a non-mutated human. If a player gets too close, they can pounce and swing their claws, dealing damage. When engaged in combat, they will rush towards the player, trying to dodge bullets if shot at, and will strike with various melee attacks.\n\nGulpers have the passive ability of slowly regenerating health and they will not enter buildings or climb stairs. If one does so, the gulper will retreat but stay in the general area. Sometime after the Great War, experiments were conducted in Vault 4 by Lloyd and Cassandra Hawthorne attempting to hybridize humans and rad-resistant species. A group were successfully bred by impregnating women with genetically engineered embryos. During an uprising of the test subjects in Vault 4, most of the staff were slaughtered (including the Hawthornes), and several of the gulper specimens escaped and began nesting in the flooded area around the pre-War Hollywood Boulevard. Though sharing the name of its East Coast counterpart, this \"gulper\" more closely resembles an axolotl (which is also a species of salamander) rather than a hellbender salamander, with pale-pink skin and a mouth full of human-like fingers, as well as distinct human-like hands and eyes.",

Standing much taller than the average human, their body is covered with filthy and shaggy fur with clusters of mushrooms growing in the fur on their back, similar to fungus grew in the fur of pre-War sloths. These megasloth mushrooms release clouds of spores when the sloth shakes its body, deterring aggressors that get too close. They have heavily calloused patches of skin and sharp teeth. Mega sloths are much larger than pre-War variants.",

The mutation twisted them into mockeries of their former selves, with a secondary head forming like with brahmin, along with a pair of vestigial hoofed limbs protruding from its chest. Radstags typically avoid confrontation while grazing on the Commonwealth's grasses and shrubberies, preferring to flee any predators threatening them. However, when backed into a corner or otherwise forced to fight, it will stand its ground and use its horns to defend itself. Many populations of radstags are fundamentally flawed and permanently damaged by the mutations they suffered. The Island and Appalachia, for example, are home to erratic and devolved radstag herds, which have lost all of their fur, with skin hardened by radiation and exposure to the fog into leather. The degenerative mutations actually increase their resilience and ferocity, despite gaping holes in their bodies and malformed horns. Descended from deer, the radstag is primarily a prey creature. It's quite fast and resilient, requiring a bit of precision when hunting. This creature drops radstag meat and a radstag hide on death. They are dicephalic, or two-headed; each head is able to swivel and turn on its own. A closer inspection of the heads shows that each head's inner eye is blind. Radstags also have two underdeveloped legs hanging limply from their chest, qualifying them as hexapedal. Aside from the ability to bend when a radstag lays down, these legs are nonfunctional.\n\nRadstag are usually brown-furred and patchy in places, with small pus-filled cysts from radiation, which most often cover the flanks, feet, heads and snouts. The cysts more frequently appear on the rabid and glowing varieties and can cover most of the body. Radstag yearling coats are more colorful than those of adult radstags and feature white spotting, similar to the fawns of their deer ancestors.",

The creature has retained its ancestors' pointed ears, membranous wings, and echolocation. However, it has lost most of its fur, grown to a tremendous size, developed an extra pair of functional legs, and evolved to become the carrier of a plague which converts any infected living being into the Scorched. Despite their size, scorchbeasts possess considerable agility, and even when grounded they can leap several times their body length in one bound. Despite the behavior of their progenitors, scorchbeasts are not averse to daytime hunting and are known to cooperatively hunt in groups. Strong and aggressive, it attacks with razor-sharp teeth and claws. The beasts are potent foes, as lamented by the Responders, whose anti-scorchbeast tactics boil down to doing everything in their power to keep away from it and finding an enclosed space to fire from, as scorchbeasts are simply too big to fit into small spaces. Scorchbeasts also emit radiation and are capable of using powerful ultrasonic echolocation as a means of navigating or commanding their Scorched servants on the ground.  In addition to this, they possess the ability to emit a powerful sonic blast capable of shattering wood and metal structures from their mouths much like mirelurk kings and mothmen, but on a far larger scale. Their other nonconventional attack includes flying over an area and saturating it with an acidic, radioactive mist that permeates through cover. Scorchbeasts, detectable by the distinct sound of their wings when they are flying overhead, are generally hostile to the player character and will summon additional Scorched enemies while fighting. They utilize three different attacks, the first being a long-range sonic attack, which is performed while flying and counts as explosive damage rather than energy damage. The interval between these attacks is at least ten seconds. The second attack is a radioactive fog, commonly referred to as crop dusting due to its dispersing from its wings much like a crop duster, and capable of traveling through roofs and walls. The scorchbeast will continue to dust an area, even if one is hidden. The scorchbeast queen uses a variant of this attack that deals poison damage, rather than the standard radiation damage. The third attack style is a sweeping attack which it utilizes while on the ground, using its wings to swing at its enemies within melee range to deliver heavy damage to them. They can also perform a lunging attack to force enemies to turn around to resume attacking it if it lunges over them and gets behind them. Their final attack consists of a shockwave attack that can not only damage enemies, but also summon Scorched to its aid to take out its would-be killers.",

            "constant": false,
            "content": "The Scorched Plague is a mutagenic infection that ravaged Appalachia between 2085 and 2103, wiping out nearly all human life in the region save for those sheltered within Vault 76. By 2103, through the efforts of the Vault Dwellers of Vault 76, the plague's inoculation had been distributed to many Appalachians, including settlers, the Crater Raiders, the Brotherhood of Steel and those at Nuka-World on Tour, halting the spread of the disease to humans. As of 2105, the plague still exists. The origins of the Scorched Plague begins with the Scorchbeast; originally, what was once a typical bat was grotesquely mutated via the machinations of the Appalachian Enclave's biochemical experiments around 2083, deep below the Cranberry Bog. While containment of these creatures was far from successful, it would not be until 2086 that the megalomaniac aspirations of then-Secretary of Agriculture turned President Thomas Eckhart unleashed the Scorchbeasts entirely on an unsuspecting Appalachia. In the early stages of these experiments, the bats appeared to have an uncanny ability to attract other animals, but the biochemical experiments were considered a failure. It was not until the bats were accidentally exposed to both biochemical agents and radiation that the Scorched Plague came to be. From a naturally-secreted particulate falling from their wings, the Scorchbeasts spread this infection wherever they reached.\n\nRegardless if it were a human, animal or mutant, the Scorched Plague was able to infect nearly every living thing it touched, with possible droplet methods of infection, with few exceptions. The plague starts with a series of intense physical changes in its victims. At first, the victim's skin will darken, and smell of ash. Eventually, intense burning lesions begin to form all over the infected body, which would appear to be smoldering. After some time, the victim's skin will split open, exposing their reddish-pink flesh and the strange presence of green ultracite crystals that break up from beneath their skin. At this point, the infection has fully taken hold of its victim, transforming them into a Scorched.\n\nCoupled with these physical changes is the degradation of the victim's mental faculties, more so if they are human. Most importantly, however, is their assimilation into the Scorchbeast's hive mind. As a Scorched, the victim is completely enthralled to the will of the hive mind, hostile to everything that is not already infected. In the case of Scorched humans, the assimilation into the hive mind is not completely absolute, as infected humans may demonstrate some awareness as to what state they're in. Physically, however, they have little to no ability to go against the greater whims.\n\nEvery Scorched was a vector for greater infection, a purpose with which they are compelled to fulfill until they totally succumb to the disease within them and are left as nothing more a petrified, ashen husk.\n\nScorched humans made up the breadth of the Scorched Plague's victims. Most human Scorched are able to effectively utilize weaponry, including firearms. Fighting carriers of the Scorched Plague in and of itself was extremely dangerous, as transmission was a great risk, coupled with the then-lack of any form of inoculation.\n\nInitial scorchbeast sightings were often dismissed as rumors or hallucinations, but soon the various factions of Appalachia would be forced to assess the severity of the unstoppable plague. Many scrambled to develop means with which to combat the spread of the disease, developing a variety of countermeasures in an effort to destroy, contain or even cure the plague. However, divisions and hostility would set in; some dismissed the severity of the plague, others simply underestimated the threat and were too late to make a difference, or squabbling politics and mutual distrust between organizations would lead to the downfall of every major player in the region.",

Hostile mothmen can be encountered quite regularly by visiting cultist locations at night, though they occasionally spawn elsewhere and observe humans from a distance.\n\nMost of these creatures are believed to be interchangeable animals--even by their worshippers, who consider them divine heralds of a higher power. However, a sect calling themselves the Enlightened exclusively revere the purple-eyed Wise Mothman, which they believe to be a unique, sentient, mortal creature who somehow existed before the Great War. These rare creatures like to stalk humans, only to flee or defend themselves when confronted. They may also stand on a perch in the ruins or wilderness, watching over a specific area. However, they do not attack opportunistically, and must be threatened or startled into combat. If approached from a distance, they generally acknowledge and warn enemies before resorting to violence. Adult mothmen are typically solitary creatures unless congregating at a site of worship or nesting ground.\n\nWhen idle and alone, they tend to sit with their wings wrapped around themselves like a shroud. At a glance, they could be mistaken for a huddled, cloaked figure, were it not for their piercing eyes. Their silhouette is further distinguished by segmented antenna, evoking small antlers or furrowed brows. Their leathery wings are usually drawn back in the presence of people. They pull themselves forwards on four undulating legs, with a pair of forelegs held close to the face. As they amble over land, their wings drag behind them like overlong coattails. This reduces stress on the abdomen, their center of gravity, which must be dragged across the ground. The top and back of the body is protected by a heavy brown mane, somewhat resembling the mantle of a fur cloak.\n\nThough they may chaotically slam around the environment when defending themselves, they are not known to bite, scratch, sting, wrestle, or otherwise attempt to physically strike their foes.",

Small, flight-enabled swarms also exist and act together as if by a hive mind in the group. Ants are not a serious threat, only being dangerous when swarming the player character due to encroachment of their territories. Giant ants are large insectoids inhabiting the area earlier known as Northern California and Oregon, and tend to live in dark places, such as caverns, and can be found in Arroyo and Broken Hills. As they are insects they have three pairs of legs, and a powerful exoskeleton. They are also prone to turn into a frenzy, should their primary sense organ, their antenna, be damaged. The heart of the swarm, a giant ant queen is significantly larger than drones and soldiers and capable of spitting acid at attackers. However, her large size renders her largely immobile, while the wings are little more than a vestigial limb, capable of threat displays, but little beyond that. The queen is roughly four to five times larger than the average giant ant. When threatened, she buzzes her wings and will hiss at the enemy. She will then proceed to spit an acidic saliva at the enemy in an attempt to ward them off. She cannot move much, so avoidance is easy, especially in smaller spaces.",

            "content": "An example of the mutations caused by the Great War, the bloatfly is an evolution of either the Musca domestica (common housefly) or Tabanus genera of biting horse fly.  Tentatively classified as part of the Tabanidae family in the order Diptera, class Insecta, phylum Arthropoda and kingdom Animalia by the Enclave, it is a major divergence from its evolutionary forebears. The standard bloatfly has a green and brown carapace and is significantly larger and more tenacious than its predecessors. Its size inhibits previous flight characteristics and agility, making it impossible to feed like pre-War horse flies did. Instead, it uses its engorged stinger and pupae gestating within its abdomen to incapacitate prey. The stinger is capable of launching mature larvae with a barbed sting at the end. These latch onto the target and deliver a neurotoxin capable of incapacitating larger prey, allowing the bloatfly and its larvae to feed. Its neurotoxin is ineffective against humans and larger targets, causing only localized necrosis. As a result, the bloatfly serves as prey rather than predator among wastelanders who utilize its meat for food.  Bloatflies can resort to scavenging in situations where prey or other sources of sustenance are scarce. It adapted to its enlarged size with a unique gland that enables it to balance and maintain speed despite its size. Bloatflies are a common sight in the wastes, varying in size and exhibiting territorial instincts alongside an absence of self-preservation. They can be found in swarms of two to four and will attack targets relentlessly. Bloatflies may explode upon death.",

Radroaches are found mainly in underground areas and sewers across North America, which can cause them to be a pest in certain Vaults because they can usually be found in fairly large groups. They feed on the dead, but will go after living creatures if isolated. Their numbers are their biggest advantage.\n\nThese radroaches are commonly seen in the dark, damp or irradiated parts of the wasteland and look similar to normal cockroaches, save for the fact that they have mutated to be the size of a domestic cat. They are generally little more than a nuisance to Armageddon survivors and less than likely to pose a challenge. Radroaches are territorial and rather aggressive, but not very harmful. Anyone can kill them with their bare hands, and will only attack when they feel threatened by passersby. Although they are winged, radroaches are not capable of flight. Still, it is possible that the wings are used for interspecies communication Radroach innards are useful in the treatment of radiation poisoning and are widely used by tribals for this purpose.",

Using the FEVS-006458 strain on October 23, 2077, scientists created a stable - if horrifying mutation. Based on the snallygaster strain, researchers tweaked the genome, producing a giant that shattered the containment unit, but was otherwise stable (excepting the absence of a discernible head).[1] The mutant was sedated and transported off-site via truck, with the Great War sidetracking the convoy and allowing the monster to escape into the wild due to a nuclear detonation blinding the driver. The resulting monster is headless, hairless and has a grayish color skin with a leathery texture. It stands around 7.5 feet (2.3 meters) tall and has an oversized chest. The mutations that turned it into a powerhouse have also turned its skin and led to the development of glands that can eject globs of corrosive, oily substance in a wide area around it. The Grafton Monster is a gigantic, hairless gray creature with a disproportionately large upper torso and arms, stumpy legs and enormous three-fingered fists. Its head is non-distinct, seemingly tucked beneath the bulk of its shoulder muscles, which makes it rather difficult to make successful headshots on the creature. It was once human before it was horribly mutated by an experimental FEV strain.",

The legend states that a woman named Leeds (Jane Leeds) cursed her thirteenth child in pregnancy, frustrated by her ever-expanding family. She said that the child would be the \"devil.\" As the legend states, she actually gave birth to a dragon-like abomination, which promptly fled away from its mother into the wilds of the Pines. The legend persisted and the devil was depicted on the collectible card released by Grey Tortoise to promote its cigarettes. The tale provided a readily available name when a dragon-like mutant did appear in the Pine Barrens area. While myths about it being an actual incarnation of Satan, together with the usual stories of pacts and boons, the Devil was just a horribly mutated and incredibly dangerous wild animal. The Jersey Devil and its offspring, known as Lesser Devils, have a unique feature: their blood. Antonio Russo learned of this when he and Gene analyzed the body of a Lesser Devil that Antonio killed. Antonio made a mistaken attempt to seek out the Jersey Devil and sign over his soul, at first under the impression the Jersey Devil would be intelligent. However, he had no choice but to kill the Lesser Devil when it turned out to be a hostile animal. The blood is incredibly potent and addictive, with Russo and Gene turning it into the Devil's Blood, a highly addictive, incredibly rare and prohibitively expensive narcotic for Atlantic City high rollers.[2]\n\nHowever, Antonio was unaware that the Lesser Devils emerging from the Pine Barrens near Atlantic City were actually juveniles. The Lesser Devils are offspring of the real Jersey Devil, which has even more potent blood, strong enough to produce an antidote for the Devil's Blood chem. The Devil's Blood continues to be produced from slain Lesser Devils who wander into the city, while the real Jersey Devil still lies in wait in the Pine Barrens. One way to lure it out is to use pheromones; the Devil reacts strongly to pheromones its species emit, enough to draw one from the Barrens into the flooded city center of Atlantic City.",

The first of these was FEVS-006443 from October 14, 2077, a Phase 2 combination strain that combined traits that resembled a number of different species. The results were considered disturbing by the scientists but provided valuable insights as to the capability of recombinant FEV. Changes included a number of ocular organs along the enlarged upper torso, a second set of arms ending in clawed digits and a large sickle-shaped claw on each inner toe. The living, stable and functioning subject was sustaining itself normally (a major accomplishment for the program) and was planned for release in Huntersville after the subsequent experiment matured. The mutant was not returned to the area until January 3, 2078, when it escaped containment and the facility. The mutant procreated, leading to the emergence of snallygaster mutants across Appalachia. The snallygaster is a quadrupedal creature. It has two arms with three claws each, of which one is an opposable thumb, and two small limbs on the back of its body, which it usually uses to support itself while sitting. It has no proper face but has a mouth with a long tentacle-like tongue covered in acid and has multiple eyes along its back. A snallygaster will use its tongue like a whip up close and spit balls of acid at a range. The snallygaster has at least 40 eyes, two rows of teeth and thorns on its back. It has been described as being \"a dragon-like demon that haunts an area outside of neighboring DC.\" They are easily recognizable from a distance, due to their signature clicking sounds and the thick, pungent odor they emit.",

Flourishing strangler vines may produce strangler pods. When mixed with other ingredients, these pods can be used to create compounds with significant healing properties such as super stimpaks. When high-powered fertilizer is flushed from Dyer Chemical and infused into the swamp, nearby strangler pods produce strangler blooms.

They are trapped within the deteriorating suits they once used while mining, and will attack anything they perceive as a threat. Despite their suffering, almost all of their cognition and human-like behavior remains, with mole miners frequently carrying things they considered important in a previous life, such as keys to their old mining lockers. A unique mole miner named Purveyor Murmrgh has even gone so far as assembling vending machines, opening up a trading post at Berkeley Springs Station prior to relocating to the Rusty Pick. Here, she sells her wares for a price. The mole miners were first encountered in Welch and experimented upon by the Appalachian Enclave and its Research Division prior to their collapse in 2086. The particular cause of their significant degeneration is unclear, whether it is caused by radiation, the toxic atmosphere of their underground dwellings in the Ash Heap, or a combination of both. However, it is significant enough to prevent them from breathing normally without their Filter-O-Matic respiration device and breathing apparatus. Mole miners are highly communal and are rarely (if ever) encountered outside of their organized groups. Their hierarchy follows the organizational structure of pre-War mining operations, with the actual miners (including scrapers, diggers, and rockbreakers) led by foremen and supervisors, a testament to their pasts as coal miners. Openly hostile to nearly everyone (save for Purveyor Murmrgh, the only known exception), the mole miners are highly aggressive, well-armed, and have even managed to domesticate mole rats. They make use of a variety of shotguns, assault rifles, missile launchers, and improvised weapons to attack their enemies while using their mole rats as anything from standard attack animals to mobile landmines. Once human, the mole miners have since mutated into stout, squat, and hardy humanoids that display a territorial hostility towards outsiders. Their limbs are extremely short and thick, and they have claws.  They stand in a permanent hunch with their limbs tucked closely to their body. They dress in thick layers, but part of their faces can be seen if one looks closely under their hoods. Their eyes unnaturally bulge, and their faces are puffy and undefined.\n\nMole miners require their breathing apparatus and respiration device to survive, suffocating without it. Their speech is unintelligible to humans.\n\nTheir mutations have endowed them with powerful strength that allows them to wield heavy weapons effortlessly. Their aggression and hardiness render them capable of warding off staggers, and their determined shuffling allows them to close the gap between themselves and enemies fairly quickly.

They are commonly accompanied by other FEV creations, such as mutant hounds and unstable early experiments, the behemoths.\n\nWhile a cure for the effects of FEV was speculated by ZAX 1.2, this is the only strain that can be cured. The Institute scientist, Brian Virgil, is the first to successfully create a serum that recreated his original human DNA while overwriting the FEV present in his system. super mutants derived from FEV experiments at the West Tek research center in Appalachia, including mass exposure of the denizens of Huntersville and infection of survivors by the Enclave under orders from President Thomas Eckhart, in a desperate bid to increase the DEFCON rating and gain access to the region's missile weapons. Widespread, violent and hostile, these super mutants have a major presence in the region and are a common enemy for factions that inhabited Appalachia in the past (Responders and Taggerdy's Brotherhood) and those who have returned to it after the Scorched Plague, such as the Brotherhood First Expeditionary Force under Paladin Leila Rahmani. Like before, they are accompanied by similarly mutated hounds and floaters.",

Despite their low intelligence, they are deadly and constantly try to enter the city.  Timothy Lane himself treats the Overgrown as a low priority, considering the constant maneuvering and jockeying for power by the other two factions in Atlantic City the real problem.\n\nThe Overgrown were not a significant problem at the start and the Munis focused on other priorities, just trimming the hedges so to speak. This lack of understanding and complacency would eventually prove a significant oversight. He delegated the responsibility to Sloane to ensure Acee is protected, but despite his intentions, the Family's aggressive behavior has caused Chief Sloane to treat Casino Quarter as a low priority, leaving gaps in coverage and the occasional perimeter breach that left multiple people wounded. Most Acee civilians considered the very idea of aggressive plants laughable. The origins of the Overgrown are unclear, though they all bear an uncanny resemblance to humans, especially where their \"faces\" are. It's enough to give some pause and even believe that they are the risen dead, coming back to haunt them for their sins. Frieda Lane came up with three theories to explain them:\n\nMutation: Overgrown are simply a mutated species of plant(s), a result of nuclear fallout after the Great War. Their resemblance to humans is purely accidental. While she considered it the most sane theory, it also failed to explain why Overgrown have fundamentally animal cells, not plant cells, and some are capable of manipulating their environment and using tools. Zombie: Considered the least sane, it posits that the Overgrown are reanimated corpses of dead humans. It does explain why Overgrown population increases in areas with reports of people going missing, but doesn't explain the floating Tentacles. The mechanism is also unclear, as the ability of whatever zombie factor exists to infect dead bodies would also make it possible for them to infect living humans, but no such incidents were observed in Acee thus far. Parasite: The middle ground most supported by Lane's observations, posits that a parasitic bacteria enters the organism and corrupts it into an Overgrown. The parasitic infection would be unable to overcome a living organism, so it would only be possible in the recently deceased. The theory explains why the animal cells are hybrids, the variation between the Overgrown in appearance and intelligence, and perhaps most terrifyingly, opens up the possibility of them infecting species other than humans. Samples analyzed by Frieda Lane show that the cells of the Overgrown are fundamentally animal cells, rather than plant cells: They have no cell wall and lysomes are present. However, the cells also contain chloroplasts found in plants, not animals, and essential for photosynthesis. While this explained their coloration, it has stumped the researcher. They have red blood, and some of them have humanoid ribcages.\n\nRegardless of their origins, the Overgrown are extremely durable. Experiments on captive specimens showed that there are three basic types (tentatively called Roadrunner, Hulk, and Tentacles by Mrs. Lane; these correspond to the thorn, elder, and pollinator respectively) existing in a symbiotic relationship and exhibiting varying degrees of intelligence. Roadrunners are mindless attackers with no self-preservation, Hulks are large, capable of using tools, and stupid, though capable of avoiding attacks. Tentacles are floating abominations that follow either type, but have the unique property of triggering rapid tissue regeneration in the other two types, but require the other two types for protection.",

            "constant": false,
            "content": "Mirelurk is a commonly used term referring to a range of mutated aquatic species endemic to the Eastern Seaboard, particularly the Capital Wasteland, the Commonwealth and Appalachia.\n\nA similar term, lakelurk, is used to refer to species in the Colorado watershed in the Mojave Wasteland. Mirelurks have the dubious distinction of being one of the first radioactive mutants to emerge into the world, as a result of widespread radioactive pollution of the environment by United States megacorporations, such as Poseidon Energy and General Atomics. Environmental organizations such as the Nahant Oceanological Society, dedicated to saving the oceans, attempted a variety of last-ditch efforts to raise awareness of this problem and encourage radical action to curtail environmental destruction at the hands of reckless corporations. However, their efforts were in vain. Ignored by authorities, to the point where they refused to even take their phone calls (as was the case with the Boston Port Authority), they attempted to garner attention by reporting the situation to the Galaxy News Network. The media ignored their reports as well, except for running a story about the upcoming shellfish season and how great it was going to be. Of course, it neglected to mention that the average increase in mass on the order of 14% in crabs and 12% in lobsters meant that the available food supply would run out quickly, leading to colony collapse and localized extinction. Although the Great War ended corporate pollution, it was replaced by overwhelming amounts of nuclear fallout instead. In the ensuing melting pot of mutations, the modern mirelurks emerged. Attempts to classify the resulting creatures have proven difficult. The crab mirelurk, for example, contains multiple phylum markers from two distinct and unrelated species: The Atlantic horseshoe crab (Limulus polyphemus) and the Atlantic blue crab (Callinectes sapidus). As such, it would be necessary to catalog it as simultaneously belonging to the Crustacea/Chelicerata subphylums, with the simultaneous classification of two distinct classes (Merostomata and Malacostraca). Both an Enclave researcher and the Lone Wanderer assigned it its own classification: Scylla serrata horrendus. This groups mirelurks into the genus, Scylla (referring to a Greek sea monster), and the species, serrata (serrata being Latin for \"forming a row of small sharp projections resembling the teeth of a saw\"). The last part \"horrendus,\" Latin for \"dreadful\" is the subspecies. The knowledge that mirelurks were much smaller before the bombs dropped and mutated them still persists among some wastelanders in the Commonwealth. One of the most common variants of the mirelurk, Scylla serrata horrendus (a name used by both the Enclave and the Lone Wanderer) is the result of mixing between horseshoe and blue crabs. Their most noticeable feature is the large, chitinous shell that provides excellent resistance to firearms, melee weapons, and even ray guns. Soft body parts, such as their faces and sections of their abdomen, are much less resistant. Crab mirelurks instinctively know how to protect themselves with their shell. When faced with prey that can attack them at long range, a crab mirelurk will lower its head to cover its body with the chitinous shell, greatly increasing its ability to survive. Other animals tend to avoid mirelurks, perhaps instinctively realizing the danger posed by the shell. When hunting, mirelurks rely on their extraordinary sense of smell, with their poor eyesight a secondary aid. They catch their prey with their primary large claws. Once immobilized, abdominal claws strip the helpless prey as it is consumed down to the bone within minutes.",

The upper and lower fins developed into jointed claws that can grab or slash, as well as flex 180 degrees. The evolutionary line of the mirelurk kings is completely separate from the crab-based mirelurks. Having developed independently, the intelligence of mirelurk kings is much higher than crab mirelurks and a symbiotic relationship formed from mirelurk kings where they developed an ability to control the less-intelligent mirelurks.",

            "constant": false,
            "content": "Deathclaw is a term referring to genetically-engineered creatures developed by the United States military to replace humans during close-combat search-and-destroy missions. They escaped into the wild in the aftermath of the Great War, and over the next few decades colonized much of the former United States, becoming apex predators in many of the new, post-War ecosystems. Deathclaws are a large, carnivorous,  bipedal reptile species, designed for maximum lethality. The choice to make them bipedal was natural, as bipedalism raises the head, providing a greater field of vision and thus improving the ability to detect targets or resources. The upper limbs were also freed by this choice and could be fashioned into extremely dangerous weapons. The caveat is that the deathclaw is not as fast as a quadrupedal animal, though this is a largely academic concern. However, deathclaws have been observed running on all fours when charging prey. The rippling musculature of the deathclaw provides it with superior strength, excellent speed, and incredible resilience in most combat situations. Deathclaws communicate with each other in a pack using growls and body language, though they are also capable of mimicking human voices like a parrot if their intelligence is artificially increased. Their strength is further magnified by their claws. Owing to their lineage, the deathclaw has opposable thumbs, though an additional two fingers were coded into the genome, for a total of five fingers on each hand. Each terminates in a sharp talon that allows the reptile to wound and kill with frightening efficiency; a single swipe is capable of bisecting an unarmored human in seconds. Deathclaw hide is extremely tough, providing an excellent defense against blunt and edged weapons. Firearms and energy weapons are reliable tools for killing a deathclaw, though lower powered variants are likely to have trouble piercing its skin. The defense is enhanced by horns and dorsal spikes, making melee combat a very dangerous proposition However, while they are difficult opponents, their keen senses can be used against them. Loud noises and bright light, such as that emitted by flares, can be used to deter a deathclaw's advance or even keep it at bay. ",

Its wealth gave it immense sway against the United States government, rendered broke by the decade-long Sino-American War. As a result, the company deemed the USA a failed nation and shifted priorities. Hundreds of billions of dollars earned on Project Safehouse were used to ensure the survival of the company, while turning the Vaults into a giant social experiment to gather data for the company and the Enclave. The lack of confidence in the United States was so great that one of the corporation's leaders, Barb Howard, entertained the idea of Vault-Tec instigating the Great War themselves, to wipe the slate clean and usher in a new world free of war. While the company itself became defunct due to the nuclear war, with Vaults failing to safeguard their populations and failing, despised by surface dwellers as retreats for the rich.

            "content": "The Capital Wasteland is a loosely defined geographic region, spanning areas of Virginia, Maryland, Pennsylvania and the District of Columbia surrounding the Potomac River from (roughly) Harpers Ferry to the Potomac tidal basin. The term was coined at the turn of the 21st century and by the 23rd entered common parlance. A once verdant and populated area of the U.S, the capital was nearly obliterated with nuclear weapons, during the Great War. As of 2277, the area is little more than a scorching, barren desert where life for its inhabitants is a constant struggle for survival. It stretches from Raven Rock in the northwest to Rivet City in the southeast, with what's left of the Potomac River dividing it roughly in two. The region known as the Capital Wasteland has been severely warped by the apocalypse. Although it was a lush temperate region before the war, the climate shift caused by the unprecedented scale of nuclear warfare unleashed on the world has led to desertification. Once made fertile by the Potomac, the Capital Wasteland turned increasingly desolate as the river dried up over the years. By 2277, the once-mighty river is little more than a swamp, with wastelanders able to cross it with dry feet in most places above roughly the neighborhood of Foggy Bottom. The drying up of the watershed has impacted the ecosystem and agricultural prospects in the region, with most plants unable to thrive in these conditions and the population of animals falling down accordingly. The situation changes in the more urbanized areas of the region. Washington, D.C. weathered the nuclear storm but sustained severe wounds in the process. Much of the downtown area of the city has been reduced to rubble, its buildings but shells containing hundreds of tons of rubble. Certain neighborhoods evaded complete destruction and remain in better shape, although that's not saying much. Curiously, the automated infrastructure has survived intact, with automated power stations continuing to provide power, allowing capable survivalists to benefit from the technology of the ancients. The adjoining territories of the pre-War states of Maryland and Virginia are home not only to derelict villages and townships, but also remnants of the pre-War grandeur of the United States: the grand Fort Bannister and the mysterious Fort Constantine, the crumbling Wheaton Armory and National Guard depot, and what remains of its industry; the Corvega factory and the Nuka-Cola plant, as well as the extensive pre-War power line and monorail networks of Virginia and Maryland are but a few examples. Compared to the rest of the United States mainland, the Capital Wasteland appears to suffer from severe contamination. Even two centuries after the war, the remaining radiation continues to interfere with agriculture, with all but the hardiest mutated plants able to take root in the contaminated soil. Most cities cannot support regular agriculture and trade for the necessary food. A fine example is Megaton, which has its own water treatment plant, but lacks agriculture and buys its food from traders. Most cities cannot support regular agriculture and trade for the necessary food. A fine example is Megaton, which has its own water treatment plant, but lacks agriculture and buys its food from traders. Much of the wildlife inhabiting what is now called the Capital Wasteland died out. While the ecosystem has been severely damaged, some species survived and adapted to the changing circumstances. For instance the mirelurks are pre-War crab and turtle species that inhabited the Potomac, which has adapted to survive in the radioactive waters of the semi-dried upriver. Yao guai are also fierce, mutated bears indigenous to the region, whose natural lethality and resilience were only enhanced by radiation-induced mutations. radscorpions are also a common sight, evolved in much the same way as their cousins in the west. Their smaller insectoid siblings, bloatflies, have also increased in size, though are relatively harmless – and a good source of protein for hunters. The relatively stable, even natural ecosystem that emerged in the Capital Wasteland is disturbed by a unique type of wildlife, endemic to the border areas of Virginia: super mutants. These giant, yellow-green beasts have a rudimentary level of intelligence and are capable of constructing simple structures and clothing, as well as operating tools of varying complexity. A fixture of the Wasteland since 2078, they became a permanent nuisance, dragging away people to be turned into super mutants, but never achieving major success due to their brain damage and lack of organization. Unlike other animals, super mutants are seen largely as pests and culled appropriately when practical. In general, the economy of the Capital Wasteland for much of its existence was predominantly focused on subsistence and scavenging. The depopulation through nuclear fire has ensured that vast amounts of wealth remain untapped within the ruins, for those brave enough to enter them and scavenge. Slavery was a particularly lucrative business, though with a limited clientele. However, certain locales, such as The Pitt and Paradise Falls, have a high demand for slaves. Hunters could also expect to make a good living in the wasteland, as the changed ecosystem still produced prey that can make for a fine source of meat – even if that prey moved on two legs. The only settlement with a major agricultural output was Rivet City, the primary supplier of edible, non-irradiated food in the Capital Wasteland, trading foodstuffs grown in its hydroponic bays for essential raw materials with other communities. Despite the harsh realities of the wasteland, a caravan route was set up by Canterbury Commons' \"Uncle\" Ernest Roe, providing one of the few reliable links between existing settlements. It was maintained by four merchants with modest protection and provided much needed economic exchange between the isolated settlements in the wasteland. Another trade route led as far as Point Lookout, operated by Tobar, who exchanged punga fruit and other goods produced in the region for salvage and other necessities produced by the Capital Wasteland. Two weeks after the activation of Project Purity, water merchant caravans could be found, transporting Aqua Pura to denizens all across the wastes, though some took advantage of the opportunity by selecting certain clientele and selling them snake oil.\n\nBy 2287, with the activation of Project Purity and the Brotherhood's rapid recovery, the situation stabilized greatly. The Capital Wasteland became a major exporter of water and salvaged technology, enabled by the Brotherhood's firepower and Vertibirds. Compared to the developed lands of the West Coast, the Capital Wasteland lived up to its name after two centuries. The individual settlements were few and far in between, with the heavy presence of wild animals and especially human raiders, as well as the absence of viable farmland or stable sources of water heavily inhibiting the ability to recover. The largest settlement and de facto hegemon of the Wasteland was Rivet City, the primary supplier of edible, non-irradiated food in the Capital Wasteland, trading it for essential raw materials with other communities. Its scientific prowess was thanks to its aggressive reclamation efforts: anything useful was snatched up and brought to the City.  However, it refrained from recruiting scientists from outside settlements, such as the Underworld or Tenpenny Tower, as the vote proposing such an initiative failed in the council. The city also had the fourth most powerful military force in the wastelands, right after the Enclave, Lyons' Brotherhood of Steel, and Talon Company. The Brotherhood's presence was eventually limited to the Citadel and only a handful of reinforced outposts scattered across the District of Columbia metropolitan area. The legacy of the war with the mutants was amplified by the Schism and the formation of the Brotherhood Outcasts in 2276. A year after the split, the Outcasts expanded into the wasteland with regular patrols scouring the wasteland for technology and began to excavate several locations, including the Virtual Strategic Simulations facility, in order to complete their original mission objectives. Ultimately, they planned to regroup with loyalist chapters in the West, though that plan was put off due to the need to protect Fort Independence and their considerable stockpile of powerful technology. However, the Enclave's defeat brought a much-needed injection of ordinance and technology, allowing Lyons' chapter to make a dramatic return within the next decade.\n\nBeyond the three organizations, the largest active group was the Talon Company. Rumors circulated that an unknown client has hired it to instigate a campaign of terror, preventing any meaningful recovery from taking place. Slavers of Paradise Falls, a major supplier of slaves to The Pitt and clients throughout the Capital Wastes, were disinterested in power plays and focused on enslaving the weak for the benefit of the strong – and their own coffers. There were plenty of other, smaller settlements in the Capital Wasteland of 2277, existing outside the rudimentary power structures. The most unique of these was the Underworld, a haven for ghouls set up in the Museum of History. As it lies in the center of an active war zone, it was fortified to defend against all but the most persistent of attackers. Following the disastrous conflict with the Enclave, the Brotherhood enjoyed a stable, but hardly unrivaled position. Suffering from severely depleted stockpiles and shortage of manpower at the beginning of the conflict, casualties taken during the fight with the Enclave and the loss of their most important military asset, Liberty Prime, made the future uncertain. Occupied by its research into the Enclave technology and the amount of gear and weapons it recovered, the Brotherhood slowly regained strength as it slowly chipped away at the years-long process. One of the greatest achievements of the Brotherhood of this time was starting the construction of The Prydwen, an armored airship greatly increasing the Brotherhood's ability to project power. The biggest setback suffered by the chapter was the death of Elder Owyn Lyons circa 2278 and the loss of his successor, Elder Sarah Lyons, later that same year. With the seat of power emptied, the remaining Brotherhood members elected multiple ineffectual leaders, while the adolescent Squire Arthur Maxson matured into a capable warrior and tactician, eventually securing a victory over Shepherd, the new warboss of the Capital Wasteland super mutants, in 2282. This feat earned him a provisional leadership position. In fact, this position was bestowed by West Coast Elders, who revealed that they still monitored their errant brethren. Maxson's position solidified in 2283, when he negotiated a treaty with the Brotherhood Outcasts, bringing them back into the fold and reforming the entire organization, merging Lyons' Doctrine with salvageable elements of traditional doctrines. Lyons' Brotherhood became a distant memory as Maxson took the united Brotherhood forces into a new direction. While some members found this distasteful and deserted, many more remained, proud to serve a refocused Brotherhood. As a result, the Brotherhood became the single most powerful organization in the Capital Wasteland, exercising firm control over the region out of the imposing Citadel and Adams AFB. Under its control, the capital wasteland is a stable place, exporting goods and giving wastelanders a chance at a life beyond mere subsistence.   ",

            "content": "The Mojave Wasteland is the region synonymous with the pre-War Mojave Desert, spanning large portions of the pre-War states of California, Nevada, Utah, and Arizona. Compared to other parts of the former United States, the Mojave survived the Great War relatively unscathed. When the nuclear apocalypse began, 77 atomic warheads were launched at the city of Las Vegas and the surrounding areas, but intricate defense systems set in place by wealthy businessman Robert House resulted in 59 of the warheads forcefully disarmed mid-flight, another nine were blasted out of the sky by a laser defense system situated atop the Lucky 38 Hotel & Casino and the remaining nine hit the surrounding desert. The Mojave Wasteland's name had been coined by at least 2083, when one of its residents, Daniel Shin, was recruited into the Brotherhood of Steel by Knight Alan Connors.  Nearly twenty years later, the Brotherhood First Expeditionary Force passed through the Mojave on their way to Appalachia. Jack Cabot mentions that his father Lorenzo thought there was an alien city buried under the Mojave Desert, just like Ubar in Rub' al Khali. In the years immediately following the War, the Mojave was largely ignored by the developing post-apocalyptic civilizations, such as the New California Republic in the west and Caesar's Legion to the east, thus allowing raiders, slavers and super mutants to prosper there. For years, Vegas sat at its heart, decayed by almost two centuries of neglect.\n\nWhen NCR scouts reached Hoover Dam with the intent of expanding the NCR's borders, pre-War Securitrons rolled out onto the old Las Vegas Strip and rallied the three tribes occupying the city, at the behest of Mr. House, the man who had saved the city centuries prior. In 2274, President Kimball sent the NCR army into the Mojave in force, with the objective of occupying and repairing Hoover Dam. With House's forces already occupying the dam and surrounding area, and the threat of Caesar's Legion looming ever closer, the NCR was forced to negotiate with House, resulting in the Treaty of New Vegas. The clauses of the treaty allow for the NCR to send 95% of Hoover Dam's power output back to their home states, as well as granting them rights to establish military bases at the Hoover Dam and McCarran Airport. In exchange, Mr. House's New Vegas Strip retains its sovereignty and could receive the tourism of NCR citizens without interference from the government as well as the remaining 5% from the dam. Shortly thereafter, combined forces of the Legion's 86 conquered tribes arrived from the east, led by Caesar and the Malpais Legate, seeking a city to call their capital. The Legion launched an attack on the dam and the NCR troops stationed there but were repelled and forced back east. Most of the credit went to Chief Hanlon for issuing a tactical retreat to Boulder City and luring the Legion into a trap laid by the NCR Rangers that leveled half of the town, then routing the surviving Legionaries back across the dam. This ultimately led to the attempted execution of the Malpais Legate. The outcome of the battle solidified the delicate balance of power in the Mojave; between the NCR, Legion, and House, should one attack the other, the third could take advantage of the conflict and attack in turn. The Mojave Wasteland has significant diversity in terms of inhabitants and landscapes. In the northwest, the super mutant and nightkin-friendly settlement of Jacobstown overlooks the valley from the snow and pine-covered mountains. To the west, the Great Khans have settled in the vibrant cliffs of Red Rock Canyon. The independent settlements of Goodsprings and Primm sit amid the encroaching New California Republic from their Mojave Outpost and the Powder Gangers, a group of escaped convicts, from the NCR Correctional Facility and surrounding camps. The forces of Caesar's Legion are slowy seeping east across the Colorado River at all possible junctures, from their mainstay at the Fort, the newly captured town of Nelson, the destroyed settlement of Nipton and Camp Searchlight, a former NCR stronghold sabotaged by means of radiation. Their forces gather strength each day, readying themselves for a second offensive against the NCR for control of the much-coveted Hoover Dam.\n\nThe central region hosts tall and imposing mountain peaks with accompanying valleys, one of which shelters the remainder of the area's Brotherhood of Steel chapter. A group of deranged super mutants and nightkin have taken residence on the foremost peak of Black Mountain. The independent settlement of Novac struggles with neighbors consisting of irradiated abominations, while businesses such as the Gun Runners, Crimson Caravan Company and the 188 Trading Post traders attempt to keep commerce viable amidst the growing chaos.\n\nFringe groups in settlements circling the middle of the region, such as the Kings and Followers of the Apocalypse in Freeside, citizens of North Vegas Square and Westside, all actively exerting their independence while supporting and sheltering those who call the neighborhoods home.\n\nIn the center of it all, the glowing jewel of the desert, the New Vegas Strip's casinos light up the night sky, contently continuing business as usual by attracting those who wish to partake in the allure of riches. Yet similar to the surrounding powers that be, also quietly fortifying itself as a power against all those who may attempt to breach its walls is the secretive benefactor of the beautiful city itself. According to Chief Hanlon, the state that was once Nevada is more fertile and has more water and foliage than California, as the population in California has exploded and caused the need for expansion east in search of new opportunities and land.\n\nA large number of native and familiar species have continued to thrive in the Mojave Wasteland. A variety of birds including ravens are seen in the wastes, pecking through debris and vegetation for food. Fish are present in Lake Mead and the Colorado River. Coyotes have managed to survive in the wasteland with little to no mutation. Despite this, the Mojave wastes are still peppered with mutated species, such as bighorners, brahmin, radscorpions, night stalkers and cazadores, with the last two a result of experimentation at Big MT.\n\nNevada agave fruit grow in abundance, as do banana yucca fruit. The ever-present radioactive fallout has still altered some of the native life, with glowing mushrooms a common sight. Snow is also present in the area. Water encountered throughout the Mojave is safer to drink and some instances are free of radiation, plant life is found consistently throughout the area and various animals are encountered on a regular basis, thriving in the mostly undisturbed lands. Because only nine warheads hit the surrounding areas around the Mojave, rebuilding society has been less challenging than in other parts of the country. Many portions of the wasteland have remained untouched by humans since the Great War (such as Vault 22 and H&H Tools Factory), while others have been resettled (such as Freeside and Novac). The pre-War buildings and factories are more intact, allowing businesses such as the Gun Runners and Michael Angelo's workshop to continue to run and operate. Technology is more well preserved, thanks to the lack of nuclear fallout, and items such as the neon signs that dot the New Vegas Strip, the monorail within Camp McCarran, or the massive generators of the Hoover Dam, have been repaired to proper working order.\n\nEveryday society is stable in some areas and not in others. While small-time traders and traveling merchants along Highway 95 and the Long 15 are able to operate, it is a fraction of what the larger and more organized traders and caravans are capable of. The larger entities have the advantages of manpower and firepower, and those that have managed to acquire pre-War technology, such as the Crimson Caravan Company, prove even more successful, some even recruited out of the region to serve with military organizations elsewhere in the pre-War United States. Super mutants are less common here than other parts of the country, and most who are residing in the area have chosen to do so in their own community of Jacobstown or the more hostile Black Mountain. Composed of remnants of the former Unity, they are considerably more intelligent than their Vault 87 and Institute cousins, though nightkin ail from severe psychological damage.\n\nSeparating New Vegas from the rest of the Mojave exists a vast expanse of desert where many dangerous creatures such as deathclaws, feral ghouls and radscorpions thrive. This generally causes most travelers to traverse along NCR-controlled highways or hire mercenaries to escort them.\n\nCasinos and gambling are popular among the locals in the area, making the New Vegas Strip a popular hub of activity for merchants, caravans, NCR troopers, opportunists and everyday people wanting to hit it big at the slots. The main casinos, The Tops, Gomorrah and the Ultra-Luxe, are run by the three tribes that settled in New Vegas. Each has its own personal rules and customs, other than the universal rule against carrying weapons into their casinos, and are overseen by Mr. House and his Securitrons. Politics play a large role in the society of the Mojave. Politics in the region boils down to three major powers: the NCR, Caesar's Legion and the Free Economic Zone of New Vegas controlled by Mr. House. The NCR is finding its war with Caesar's Legion both increasingly unpopular back in California and expensive to fund. Caravans and merchants heading to and from the Mojave deal with exorbitant taxes and fees imposed on them by the NCR. Caesar's Legion is coming ever closer to finding out what happens when their absolute ruler, and god, finally passes away and is facing the question of what truly unified the Legion in the first place, Caesar's ideals or Caesar himself. The casinos on the Strip have their own agendas and Mr. House has his own mysterious plans for the Mojave and more specifically, the Strip.\n\nThe NCR's goal in the region is to annex the Strip as an NCR territory and completely settle the region as NCR land. Many NCR soldiers and former soldiers, such as Craig Boone, believe this is not possible until the NCR takes the fight to the Legion and takes out Caesar himself; only then will the NCR be an unchallenged power in the region and able to safely settle without danger of constant attack. This sentiment is brought on by the commanding officer in the region, General Lee Oliver, constantly ordering his forces to hold the line, despite objections from his subordinates such as Chief Hanlon, Colonel James Hsu and Major Dhatri. They feel that the position the general is putting them all in, holding the line against the Fiends, ordering Chief Hanlon not to pursue the Legion at the First Battle of Hoover Dam or ordering the NCR Rangers into a support role when they have more skill than the NCR's heavy troopers, are racking a higher body count than would actively pursuing an offensive campaign against these opposing entities, which each one feels the NCR is capable of doing.\n\nThe Legion's goal is to make the Strip its new capital, replacing Flagstaff to the southeast. It also desires complete control of Hoover Dam as it is a strategic position to defend and a source of clean water. They are less interested in the power the plant provides as they reject advanced technology, believing it a crutch rather than a tool to be used. The Legion, despite a devastating defeat at the First Battle of Hoover Dam, has once again emerged from the east and actively attacks NCR outposts and camps from its base at Cottonwood Cove. Camp Forlorn Hope is an excellent example of how the Legion has regained strength, as they took the nearby city of Nelson and repeatedly assault the camp, lowering morale among the camp's inhabitants. Once the Legion takes a position, they seem to be able to hold it effectively, without much resistance. This is the opposite of the NCR, which is constantly losing footholds in positions in the eastern Mojave.\n\nMeanwhile, Mr. House fortifies his position on the Strip, letting the conflict between the NCR and the Legion play out. He believes that the fewer soldiers of each organization who try to impede his progress at the next battle of Hoover Dam, the better. He patiently bides his time, waiting to exploit vulnerabilities generated by one faction attacking the other as a constant backdrop of distant explosions, artillery and gunfire can be heard regularly throughout the region.

            "content": "Night stalkers are the pre-War creations of Dr. Borous at Big MT, being genetic hybrids of rattlesnake and coyote DNA. Dr. Borous created them in order to preserve the DNA of rattlesnakes, which he believed to be on the verge of extinction. However, his memory was unclear, and he also suggested that it may have been because of a dare with Dr. Calis at X-13. Due to their creation, the shipping department of the X-8 research center suffered a large number of fatalities, where all but one employee (Skippy) were killed by the night stalkers. However, Dr. Adam Figgis thought the executives in charge of X-8 could salvage the mishap in shipping and decided to let the night stalkers loose into the X-8 testing area to study their behavior. Sometime after the bombs dropped, many night stalkers escaped and have spread across the Mojave and beyond, with some even reaching as far as Baja. Night stalkers occasionally clash with cazadores (which were also created at Big MT) over territory. Nightstalkers are an amalgamation of the coyote and rattlesnake, displaying characteristics of both. They growl, howl and whimper like regular coyotes, but hiss, rattle and inject venom into their prey like rattlesnakes. Their bodies are mostly dog-like, covered in a combination of fur and scales. Their heads and tails, however, are more like that of a rattlesnake, including fangs and a forked tongue. Night stalkers' right eyes are blue with a round pupil, while their left eyes are yellow with an elliptical pupil, like a rattlesnake's. They lay eggs, like a snake, but raise their pups similar to a coyote, nursing their young in cave nests.\n\nNight stalkers nest in caves across the Mojave Wasteland and can be found both inside the cave or in the nearby area. Packs of night stalkers can be frequently seen hunting at night east of Morning Star Cavern near the nest with the radscorpion queen, south of the broc flower cave and northwest of the cap counterfeiting shack. Their original breeding ground is the Z-9 Crotalus DNA preservation lab, located in the Big MT.\n\nAs their name suggests, night stalkers are largely nocturnal, hunting in packs at night for unaware or sleeping prey. However, it's still possible to encounter night stalker packs during the day.\n\nNight stalker eggs can be used to prepare Mushroom Cloud. Their blood is also used as an ingredient in antivenom, hydra and nightstalker squeezin's. Night stalkers can pose a particular threat in areas of low visibility, at night (when they are active) or in caverns. They are especially dangerous inside their dens, where packs are usually large in numbers, and twisting corridors make it difficult to detect exactly where they are.\n\nNight stalkers found in the Charleston Cave and the lower level of the X-13 research facility have the preternatural ability to cloak as if using a Stealth Boy. The pack in the Charleston Cave gained this ability from collectively chewing on a Stealth Boy Mark II prototype, while the ones in the X-13 testing facility had the ability granted by an unknown scientist. From all appearances, when a night stalker is exposed to stealth radiation, it effectively turns them permanently invisible.",

Borous' memories of when these experiments took place however have become muddled; he is confident that they took place on a Tuesday, possibly in May of 2003. Formerly, the lab-grown cazadores were confined to the Z-14 Pepsinae DNA splicing lab in Big MT, but groups of the mutant insects have managed to escape the Big MT crater and moved to neighboring areas, such as the Mojave Wasteland and Zion Canyon, and rapidly multiplied their numbers in recent years. Doctor Borous confidently denies that they have escaped from Big MT or have the ability to breed, which is shown to be false. With the population widespread throughout the wasteland, they have come in contact with many groups and believed to have been given their name by Spanish-speakers of the regions they have propagated. Cazadores have a quick and erratic flight pattern. They are most often encountered in swarms of four or more, with the occasional strays flying in the outlying area. Their venomous attacks can lead to a quick death if they succeed in poisoning their target. The spikes on their back rise and fall, both when idle and when attacking.\n\nCazadores (Spanish for \"hunters\") are mutated insects found in the Mojave Wasteland, Big MT, and Zion Canyon in 2281. Cazadores are more common in mountainous regions of the Mojave Wasteland, although some swarms can be found near lakes in lower areas. They create large basket-shaped nests, many of which can be seen at places such as Bonnie Springs, cazador nest, west of the Brewer's beer bootlegging, the road heading towards Jacobstown, north of Goodsprings, inside various tents in the tribal village and the boathouse at Callville Bay, with the cazadores' original breeding ground being the Z-14 Pepsinae DNA splicing lab in Big MT.

Ranch State Park, and around Cottonwood Cove. A large contingent of wild bighorners can also be found northwest of Snyder prospector camp.

Tunnelers live underground, and are averse to intense sensory stimulation. This can be taken advantage of through the use of flash bangs or firing a flare gun, causing them to flee from combat and head back underground. Their enlarged eyes appear to be an adaptation to the conditions of their habitat. The tunneler's bite is known to be as deadly as a bark scorpion sting. Ulysses speculates that they may be a result of the Great War. After the bombs fell, radiation heavily mutated them, adapting them for an underground life. These mutations resulted in a form of bioluminescence. They evolved into quadrupedal predators that lived and bred beneath the sands of the Divide. There they remained, completely unaware of the surface world for nearly two centuries.\n\nWhen the Courier was contracted by the New California Republic to bring a package from Navarro, they unintentionally caused the detonation of many nuclear warheads that had never been launched, slumbering in their silos underneath the Divide since the Great War. The subsequent explosions and earthquakes split open the ground, releasing tunnelers into the world above. However, due to their adaptations for life underground, they are hypersensitive to bright lights and loud noises. This leaves them unable to venture outside for extended periods of time, so they remain in the tunnels they have dug or other areas free of sunlight.\n\nBy 2281, according to Ulysses, the tunnelers may pose a significant threat to the Mojave Wasteland in the near future due to their ever-expanding network of underground tunnels and nests. Ulysses claims that they reproduce quickly and hunt in large packs, enough to pose a significant hazard to the toughest of opponents, even deathclaws.",

Geckos can be found living across the entire Mojave Wasteland, with many different species calling the local area their breeding grounds. They are said to have been stemmed from Fire Root cavern. There are three types of gecko in the Mojave: normal geckos, golden geckos, and fire geckos. Another variety, the green gecko, is found in Zion Canyon. Geckos are reptilian and born with a pair of fins behind their heads. Their eyes possess an orange tint, and their body coloration differs greatly depending on the gecko subspecies in question. Geckos have evolved with five fingers and five toes. Dependent on the type, they range from the size of a small human child, to heights exceeding that of an average human adult. Geckos are generally found in small packs. Once a single gecko attacks something or is attacked, its pack will join the fight. They charge or leap at their opponents with their mouths open, ready to snap down. They attack rapidly with their claws as a melee attack and some subspecies of geckos can breathe fire or spit a poisonous liquid as a ranged attack. Legend has it that there is a giant gecko roaming the wasteland.",

            "content": "Cyberdogs, also called cyberhounds, are mechanically enhanced canines found, albeit rarely, in the wasteland. Cyberdogs are cybernetically augmented dogs which incorporate both organic and mechanical parts in their being. The abilities of individual cyberdogs vary from dog to dog, but as a rule, they are all physically superior to their organic counterparts and are far more long lived, with advanced models being intelligent enough for conversation.\n\nCyberdogs are rare and creating one is extremely difficult, requiring both a high degree of technical sophistication and generalized breeding and training programs. As such, they have only been utilized in scale by technologically advanced organizations such as the pre-War US government, the Enclave and Big MT. Big MT even took things one step further and created weapons (like the K9000) which used a dog’s brain as its central processor and could sniff out and lock onto targets. In addition to military-grade dogs, Big MT also produced lesser variants for the nation's more affluent police departments, allegedly to sniff out communists within society. Denver in particular had a large supply of cyber police dogs, and they still roam the streets. Cyberdogs have the appearance of cybernetic canines (although two exceptions exist) with a yellow sclera (only the \"cyberhound Mk III police model\" have a normal, white sclera). Cyberdogs of this type are also called \"K-9 units.\" Despite being highly modified with electronic parts, they are not affected by pulse weapons.\n\nTheir modifications include:\n\nRobotic enhancements to much of the body, including replacement limbs and artificial tail.\nReplacement of the mandible with a robotic jaw and metal bottom teeth.\nBrain removed from the skull and placed in a protective container above the head, allowing them to check their organic and cybernetic system as well as improving their perception. This brain can be swapped out for another, as a cyberdog can suffer neural degeneration over time resulting in the brain abruptly shutting down. Once swapped out, the cyberdog keeps the same personality, its memories and mannerisms it had before becoming a cyberdog, with the additional personality of the fresh dog brain being added into the mix, possibly creating a mix of attributes.\nReplacement of most vital organs with high-tech artificial implants, allowing cyberdogs to live indefinitely so long as the brain is replaced periodically (a healthy brain can live over 200 years).\nMotivator circuit integrated into the cyberdog acting like a drive mechanism. If removed, the cyberdog's legs will be rendered immobile.\nIf cyberdogs die, it is possible for them to be reconstructed or fixed.\nSome standard cyberdog models are:\n\nCyberhound Mk II personal security model, with a light gray coat, a cybernetic right eye and built for personal security.\nCyberhound Mk III law enforcement officer support model, with a light brown coat and built for pursuit.\nCyberhound Mk III police model, with a dark brown coat and built for police work.\nCyberhound Mk III military model, with a dark coat, green-colored robotic parts, vocal enhancements allowing the cyberdog to produce powerful sonic waves when barking and built for military mission. A weapon model (and an outstanding exception to the standard cybernetic canine's appearance) is the K9000 cyberdog gun, created to act as a personal operated, handheld weapon system. Instead of the standard cyberdog units, which are canine in general anatomy, the K9000 cyberdog gun is more akin to a heavy weapon. It is a living dog's brain that has been provided with a machine gun frame utilizing the .357 Magnum ammunition. Its \"canine\" features include two metallic \"ears\" mounted on top of the weapon that moves like a real dog's and a sniffer mounted on the jar containing the brain, which allow the gun to sense its surroundings. It can be enhanced with a resla roil increasing its damage by 2 and a mentat chow to increase its rate of fire by 4.\n\nAnother exception is the upgraded version of the K9000 cyberdog gun, the unique FIDO. Unlike the K9000 cyberdog gun, FIDO uses .44 Magnum rounds instead of .357 Magnum rounds, resulting in higher damage, but it also has a slightly higher spread. It has a special red brain instead of the standard green one of the K9000 cyberdog gun and the decal is changed to a bulldog. It can't be enhanced with the same modifications as available for the K9000 cyberdog gun. Other features of the K9000 cyberdog gun are included in the FIDO.",

            "constant": false,
            "content": "The Pitt, nicknamed the Steel City, City of Steel, and the Gateway to the West before the War, is a raider-dominated region within the ruins of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. It was established in the aftermath of the Great War by local gangs and by 2103, they had control over the raider settlement. Around 2255, its inhabitants were nearly wiped out by the Brotherhood of Steel, only to be revitalized by former Brotherhood Initiate Ishmael Ashur and his recently formed army of raiders. By 2277, the city's slave trade and steel industry had made it a major power on the East Coast. The Pitt was once the city of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. It was a major industrial center, not just for steel production, but also manufacturing weapons, munitions, Vertibirds, power armor, and robots to support the war effort. Because of this, Pittsburgh was a priority target for Chinese warheads. The warheads that landed near the metropolis would dramatically alter the environment around the city. The radioactive fallout from the warheads mixed with the heavy industrial pollution from the steel mills created a hazardous environment unique to the area. The devastation from the warheads also grants ample room and raw construction materials, and the river provided a seemingly-useful source of water. Unbeknownst to the city's inhabitants, however, the river had been heavily polluted with radioactive material, mutagenic agents, and dangerous carcinogens. Following the Great War, the city fell into chaos, with various raider gangs establishing their own spheres of control in the city. These gangs began building a settlement they called \"the Pitt\" using conscripted and enslaved workers, at the point where the Ohio River diverges. By 2103, the gangs had established a system by which raider \"enforcers\" oversaw the enslaved civilian workers in the construction of the settlement. Seeking to escape the violence and oppression, as well as issues with the Pitt's rivers - the Monongahela, the Allegheny, and the Ohio - becoming heavily irradiated,  a number of locals led by Paige banded together to flee the city. During these events, Captain Oliver Fields, Sergeant Fred Radcliff and Sergeant Thompson of the U.S. Armed Forces unsuccessfully attempted to liberate the civilians located in the city, getting severely wounded in the process.  The locals that managed to flee the ruins of Pittsburgh with Paige became the Settlers, gathering up more survivors on their way as they traveled south towards Appalachia. They would go on to form the settlement of Foundation in the Savage Divide in 2103. Later on, the Pitt became the scene of a bitter conflict between two factions vying for its control: the industrious survivors organizing themselves into the Union, and the vicious raider group known as the Fanatics. Over the following decades after the war, children would be born with deformities such as cancerous growths or vestigial limbs, and as the years passed, nearly the entire population became afflicted with genetic diseases and mutations caused by the polluted river waters. Mutation was the least of the inhabitants' concerns, however. Among the genetic diseases that spread in the inhabitants was a neurological condition that caused its victims to descend into a violent, primal state. Those who suffered from this condition came to be known as \"wildmen,\" roaming in packs outside the Pitt and preying on anyone who crossed their path. Worse off were those who suffered from what came to be known as the Troglodyte Degeneration Contagion, or \"TDC\"; victims of this pathogen would rapidly devolve into hunchbacked, animal-like creatures known as \"trogs,\" with newborn infants being especially susceptible to the disease. As the population degenerated, so too did the order established by the city's raiders. Within 50 years of its establishment, warring tribes of cannibals and rapists had become the dominant power in the city, with what little order existed taking the form of the strong commanding the weak.  While this eventually allowed the Pitt to settle into a state of brutal self-sufficiency, it left the city with a terrifying and infamous reputation, and travelers from across the East Coast came to avoid the place as a matter of common sense. Around 2255, an expeditionary force of the Brotherhood of Steel, led by then-Paladin Owyn Lyons, arrived at the outskirts of the Pitt on their journey to the Capital Wasteland. After reconnoitering the ruins, Lyons, for reasons unknown to his soldiers, ordered an attack on the city. More of a massacre than a military action, Brotherhood soldiers entered the city from Mount Wash, and in a single night slaughtered half of the city's population, sparing only those who surrendered immediately. This operation would come to be known as the Scourge. Shortly afterwards, the Brotherhood left the city, taking 21 healthy children, including one Greg Bear, and placing them into Initiate training. Rumors claim that the Brotherhood also recovered an important asset of some kind from the ruins, but few if any know what it was. Having suffered only a single casualty, one Initiate Ishmael Ashur, the Brotherhood marked the operation as a success, albeit a harrowing one. However, while the Scourge succeeded in calming the city and clearing it of its most violent inhabitants, it also left a power vacuum that would be seized by an unlikely individual. While he had been reported as killed in action by his squadmates after they witnessed a building collapse beneath him, Initiate Ashur actually survived the Scourge. However, while his power armor had protected him from death in the accident, he still sustained severe injuries that left him comatose for several days. When he was finally awoken, it was by a woman who had survived the purge, attempting to pry his armor off of what she believed was his corpse. After questioning the scavenger, he learned that she and her family were staging raids into other parts of the Pitt to gather supplies. Recalling recon data and his Brotherhood knowledge, he realized that the building that he had been trapped in was an operational steel mill, something that the Brotherhood had never seen before, and decided to help the locals restore their city. To this end, he recruited the scavengers, many of whom had come to see him as a god due to his miraculous survival and imposing armor, to aid him in the rebuilding process. The rebuilding of the city was made easier by the Scourge, as when the Brotherhood swept through, their focus had been on looting intact assets, leaving behind a large amount of valuable salvage that they had written off as \"damaged goods.\" The city grew rapidly under Lord Ashur, who ruled with an iron fist, pressing local raider gangs into his service and enslaving the weak to restore the steel industry, using the subsequent profits to recruit outsiders into his army and purchase healthier slaves from outside sources. While he never expressly forbade it, procreation among the Pitt's citizens was highly discouraged both by Ashur and the people themselves due to the threats posed by the city's toxic environment and TDC, with the city relying almost entirely on recruitment and slave importation to sustain its population. Recognizing the precarious and volatile nature of such a system, Ashur made careful use of propaganda to keep his subjects docile and avoid a popular revolt. He would make frequent public appearances to the city's slaves, in which he spoke on his high-minded ideals and made promises of eventual emancipation. Among his most \"progressive\" policies was allowing slaves to earn their freedom and join the ranks of his army by competing in fights to the death at a gladiatorial arena known as The Hole, which doubled as a source of entertainment for slave and raider alike.\n\nAshur considered this brutal approach to governance to be both a necessary evil and a temporary measure until a solution to the city's rampant health crisis could be found. While progress on this front at first seemed unlikely, an unexpected breakthrough came when Ashur's wife and chief scientist, Sandra Kundanika, gave birth to a daughter they named Marie. Not only did the infant show no symptoms of TDC, she seemed to be actively immune to the disease. Viewing the girl as a sign and a symbol of the Pitt's potential for the future, Ashur tasked Sandra with carefully studying their daughter's immunity, in the hopes of one day ridding the city of TDC and transforming it from a struggling autocracy into a prosperous regional empire.

They have earned a reputation for their territorial, xenophobic customs.\n\nSwampfolk will address anyone from outside their territory as \"Outsider\" and attack them on sight. The only people known to peacefully trade with them are the \"marsh folk,\" those who live within Swampfolk territory but outside their secretive, insular group. These local marsh folk have their own distinct culture. The people of Point Lookout were known to be distrustful of outsiders even before the Great War. Their ancestors proved extremely isolationist and hostile to the outside world, particularly the U.S. government; a volunteer relief worker and two military personnel were attacked by Point Lookout locals before the War. The only other government presence in the area was a concentration camp and a Naval recruiting center.\n\nThe modern Swampfolk culture stems directly from a cult led by Constance Blackhall. She instructed them in ritual using the Krivbeknih, a tome related to Ug-Qualtoth. Her brother, Richard Dunwich, was obsessed with understanding this mysterious entity, though he may not have known it by name. With the Krivbeknih's power, Constance was able to wield influence over the Swampfolk, both before and after the War. Constance was able to extend her life with the power of the book. Her grasp on the Point Lookout region remained strong well after the bombs dropped. According to local legend, the Krivbeknih was eventually stolen from her, at which point she succumbed to an unnaturally late death. At some point during or after the 2250s, a mysterious Ranger acquired the Krivbeknih in the mid-wastelands, and brought it to the Capital Wasteland in hopes of selling the book to the Brotherhood of Steel. They appraised the book and refused to purchase it. He subsequently abandoned his son and vowed to return the book to its source. After this, the book ultimately found its way into the possession of the Swampfolk.\n\nIn 2277, these folk perform the same bloody rituals and chants instilled in their ancestors by the Blackhall family, centuries ago. They torture people to death at the sacred ritual site where they keep the eldritch tome. Here, they chant incoherently while they sacrifice in misguided accordance with pre-War traditions warped beyond recognition, their original meanings long forgotten. The Swampfolk adhere to a secretive spiritual belief system based on the occult practices instilled in them by Constance Blackhall. Contemporary anthropologists have speculated the Swampfolk are still true believers in the occult, and some postulate they still pray to Ug-Qualtoth, as their ancestors had under the Blackhalls.\n\nThe areas in which they live are all decorated with specific icons and effigies. The Christian missionary Marcella compares their iconography to the Vodou, Santería and Obeah belief systems,  all of which originate in the Caribbean. It seems she studied these traditions (as documented by Christians) at the Abbey of the Road. She cannot say if the Swampfolk understand the meaning of the religious symbols they perpetuate, or if their echoes of such traditions are hollow and performative. Their totems are wrought from roots, woven through branches, teddy bears, impaled mannequin heads, and the skeletal remains of humans and brahmin. These decorations serve both as a warning to outsiders and as ritual objects relating to their private religion. They are overall comparable to the totems once fashioned by the Cult of the Mothman. Additionally, many cloth dolls representing little girls can be found dangling from trees in Swampfolk territory, not hanging by their necks, but bunched together by the center of their bodies. Dolls are also commonly hung from or impaled upon the totems themselves.\n\nAt the deepest chamber of the ritual site, mutilated gore is piled with some punga fruit upon an altar. Past this, the Krivbeknih is found in a small holy font, cradled alongside a skull covered with a thin layer of meat. Upon closer inspection, the gore on the altar was once a human laying on their back. The head was replaced with a cloth doll, and another doll was placed sitting on the chest. Both face forwards, towards the lower area of the remains, maintaining symmetry. The ritual knife is found among this display. The remains are surrounded by stimpaks. Although Point Lookout did not suffer a direct hit during the Great War, the effects of the fallout can be seen in the distinct features they have developed over the decades, the signature \"Point Lookout look.\" Furthermore, the New Plague epidemic affected their lives severely, as the local pre-War population saw a major outbreak, leading to a decline in public health which the area never recovered from. The Swampfolk are described as having sinewy, pockmarked bodies oozing with strength and pus, as well as being violent, superstitious, isolated, and uneducated. Obadiah Blackhall, descendant of Constance Blackhall, alleges that inbreeding has compounded these problems. All of them have misshapen heads and various other deformities. Some have visibly stitched skin. ",

            "content": "Point Lookout is a swampland downriver from the Capital Wasteland in 2277. Point Lookout was never directly hit by the nuclear bombs that fell during the Great War, but here, the water of Point Lookout's bogs were contaminated by the Potomac River that flows out of the Capital Wasteland. The irradiated terrain gives way to dense swamps and abandoned buildings where nature has largely replaced the human presence over two centuries. The pervasive radiation in the swamps led to the evolution of the swampfolk, a crazed, highly deformed, inbred people who live all around the swamps of the region. The radiation also gave rise to feral ghouls and swamplurks being drawn to the area's radioactive swamp waters.\n\nPoint Lookout is almost devoid of any organized society or signs of civilization, but one can trade or speak with Tobar the Ferryman, Haley of Haley's Hardware, Madame Panada, Marguerite, and the local tribals. Point Lookout is more than just a small swampy marsh, but a cache of pre-War technology waiting to be found. The area became known to outsiders from the Capital Wasteland thanks to punga fruit, a unique fruit known to grow only in the local bogs, and many legends about the supposed treasures hidden there.\n\nThe muck surrounding the region contains biogas, accumulated because of the radioactive contamination of the Civil War-era mass graves in the area. he decomposing bodies buried in these ancient mass graves were slowly decomposed into methane due to the unique environment, a dense limestone wetlands substrate. Due to the radiation's effects on the normal process of decay the mass Civil War-era graves in the area have become patches of a greenish-gray, smoking and/or steaming earthy muck that releases flammable methane bubbles occasionally.",

In 2102, Vault Dwellers emerged into Appalachia after 25 years of isolation inside Vault 76 and began to reclaim the wilderness. In 2103, survivors from the surrounding regions arrived in Appalachia and began to resettle it. Radioactive fallout from other areas of the former United States has mutated much of the local wildlife, unchecked coal mine fires have blanketed an area centered around Mount Blair in ash, factories and industrial sites around Clarksburg started churning out pollutants cloaking the area in a white powder, and a G.E.C.K. in Vault 94 was destroyed by a group of wastelanders, causing heavily mutated plant life in the northeast.\n\nOf particular concern is the Scorched Plague, caused by a hazardous, mutagenic plague indigenous to the vast caverns beneath Appalachia. It is spread by scorchbeasts, which periodically breach the surface and terrorize the countryside. The Forest region of Appalachia is characterized by forests growing on rugged terrain, winding rivers, and diverse wild and plant life, providing scroungers with food and water. The area is the location of several pre-War settlements including Charleston, Flatwoods and Point Pleasant, as well as landmarks such as Landview Lighthouse. Likewise, the area encompassing the region is mostly that of in and around Kanawha County, named for its river, the Kanawha River. ",

The area following the Ohio River, the western boundary of Appalachia (and the State of West Virginia), is mainly comprised of wooded and mountainous terrain. It is more remote and has fewer large settlements, with the exception of Point Pleasant. This is where a cult began its worship of Mothman. In the northern part of this region is the area that borders the Toxic Valley. This northeastern forest features both lower, more peaceful areas and toxic border areas (the boundary of which is Route 92). Part of the region surrounding Vault 76 wasn't nuked. Three sides of the Forest are surrounded by rivers, and the southwestern part features wooded terrain.  Following the Christmas Flood of December 25, 2082, Summersville Lake now lies almost completely dry, at its heart is the shanty settlement of \"New Gad\". After the flood (not including the damage from the bomb), the remains of Charleston went down the Kanawha River. Its remains are a flooded ruin; to the northwest is their Fire Department, and along the lake's southeast shores are opulent mansions. The Forest is in the center-west portion of the Appalachia map, to the north of the Ash Heap, south of the Toxic Valley and west of the Savage Divide. ",

Despite a total change in habitat, bloodworms have retained two of their original traits. The first of these is their burrowing ability; instead of burrowing into wet sand and silt, their four hollow jaws have become adept at plowing through the tough and dried soil. They use this ability quite a bit, ambushing prey from beneath the surface, and then returning underground to catch their prey unaware again. Bloodworms that have mutated since the Great War, they are now approximately the size of an adult human being and have spines on the outside of their body in addition to their four-pronged maw. These worms react to the presence of intruders in their territory and will charge the intruders by burrowing through the dirt at high speeds. Upon reaching their prey, they will lunge forth from the ground and attempt to bite their target.\n\nBloodworm larvae will also inhabit the corpses of large prey, such as brahmin and brahmiluffs, and come out of the corpse to attack any new prey that wanders by. These brahmin can be spotted from a distance if watched, as they will twitch and bulge slowly.",

            "constant": false,
            "content": "In the time before the Great War, Mount Desert Island, situated off the coast of the state of Maine was home to Acadia National Park, and also hosted an experimental wind farm on the mountainside intended to serve as a \"clean\" alternative to nuclear power; the project was set to be shut down and dismantled at the end of October 2077 due to the threat that wind power presented to its nuclear-based parent company. The Cliff's Edge Hotel was also used as the surface structure below which Vault 118 was constructed to house its affluent residents who turned themselves into robobrains.\n\n Following the nuclear apocalypse, the island's landscape was permanently changed. The nuclear fallout resulted in the landscape being perpetually blanketed in a thick, radioactive fog; over 200 years of exposure has resulted in nearly every species on the Island being severely mutated while only a few areas are still habitable by humanity. By 2287, three major factions inhabit the island: the residents of the port town of Bar Harbor, now called Far Harbor; a local chapter of the Church of the Children of Atom operating out of a pre-War military submarine base called the Nucleus; and Acadia, a refuge inhabited by runaway synths escaping the Institute.\n\nThe main conflict sprouts from friction between Far Harbor and the Children of Atom; the Children of Atom welcome and encourage the radioactive Fog to consume the island, believing it to be the will of Atom, which is conversely not in the best interests of the coastal town. As a result of the Fog's encroachment, Far Harbor's inhabitants has literally been pushed to the edge, with the docks being the only habitable area safe from the Fog while also losing friends and family to the radiation or the mutated wildlife encouraged to dwell where the Fog lies. In response to this, several residents of Far Harbor have been hostile toward and even killed many of the cult's missionaries over the years out of a belief they are directly helping the Fog spread, which only encouraged the Children to spread their gospel with increased fervor. Meanwhile, Acadia is the \"third wheel\" in this conflict, having been established only a short time after the hostilities between Far Harbor and the Children of Atom began. Many of the Harbormen are suspicious of the synth refuge to the south, as with all outsiders, even after Acadia provided Fog condensers to help prevent the town from becoming an irradiated ruin, an act which also angered the Children as they saw it as an affront to Atom. Against their hopes, the synths of Acadia have been roped into the conflict, despite efforts to peacefully reconcile the hatred between Far Harbor and the radioactive zealots to the west. Access to the Island from the Commonwealth is entirely restricted to the use of a boat that is either equipped with automatic guidance systems or manned by an experienced crew, as anything else risks being run up against the jagged rocks or colliding with the numerous shipwrecks surrounding its shores. The Island itself is quite large. The climate is cold and wet, dark and dreary, accented by rolling pockets of radioactive fog and frequent radioactive thunderstorms in thick wooded areas. These radstorms are especially frequent on the southern end of the Island.\n\nThe three faction hubs found on the Island include Far Harbor on the northeast side; Acadia closer inland and to the south of Far Harbor, and the Nucleus, situated in the swamplands on the western side.\n\nThe Island also features a few pre-War factories, a pre-War mill called Echo Lake Lumber, two hotels, some National Park campgrounds and buildings, a drive-in movie-theater called Eden Meadows Cinemas, Beaver Creek Lanes bowling alley, an Oceanarium, a ruined church, Waves Crest Orphanage, and a variety of dilapidated pre-War houses, farms, and structures, many of which are now inhabited by gangs of trappers or super mutants, in addition to feral ghouls and various irradiated creatures.\n\nA semi-completed Vault-Tec vault, Vault 118, is located beneath the Cliff's Edge Hotel just north of Acadia. There is also Brooke's Head Lighthouse on the southern coast of the island, which features prominently on the picture promoting the Far Harbor add-on. Towards the center of the island is the wreckage of Horizon Flight 1207, presumed to have crashed there during the War.\n\nThere are many ruined watercraft and small islands dotting the coastline of the main island. Some of these are inhabited by creatures, trappers or other factions, while others are uninhabited.\n\nInstead of Nuka-Cola, the residents of the island preferred their own locally produced soda brand known as Vim!, even before the War, and it can still be purchased in Far Harbor and found throughout the island. There remains a Vim! Pop factory on the southern part of the island where the beverage was produced prior to the War, now inhabited by super mutants.",

            "comment": "The Commonwealth",
            "constant": false,
            "content": "The Commonwealth is a geographic region largely encompassing the former state of Massachusetts in New England. Among other locales, the Commonwealth includes the former state capital of Boston. A powerful force in the history, industry, and culture of the United States, Massachusetts was one of the original Thirteen Colonies. Massachusetts became a hotbed of secessionist sentiment. The conflict between colonists and the crown was only aggravated by attempts to tax the colonies without giving them representation in the parliament, resulting in the Boston Massacre and the Boston Tea Party. The powder keg finally ignited in 1775, when the Thirteen Colonies openly rebelled against the crown during the American Revolutionary War.  The battles of Lexington and Concord were the first engagements of the war, which spilled across the colonies. The evolution transformed the face of Massachusetts, with the state's economy supercharged by the emergence of a vibrant high technology sector spearheaded by the Commonwealth Institute of Technology. Located in Cambridge, the CIT was one of the foremost centers of higher learning in the nation, providing it with many great minds, including Robert House, who founded RobCo Industries in 2042, after graduating CIT, and turned it into one of the most profitable companies on the planet within five years. As private and public interests flocked to Massachusetts, the face of the state changed as well. Skyscrapers sprouted across the financial district, with several cutting edge facilities established by many major corporations. A sophisticated network of elevated superhighways and monorail lines are present throughout the city, all of which spanning from the 2040s up until 2077. Several companies including Mass Fusion (the state's primary energy provider), Vault-Tec Corporation (which also established a number of its vaults across the state), Poseidon Energy, General Atomics International, Galaxy News Network, HalluciGen, Inc., Nuka-Cola Corporation (setting up Nuka-World in the western part of the state) and many more. The ports of Massachusetts continued to bring in commerce and traffic, until the beginning of the Resource Wars. Cambridge Polymer Labs developed nanotechnology to further refine the military's weapons. Sentinel Site Prescott to the southwest of the state was erected as defense against nuclear weapons. However, the erosion of civil rights and basic morality did not spare the state or its people. Corporations operated as if unhindered by labor or environmental regulations, especially those with exceptions by the state. The pollution eventually reached such a degree that mutations started to occur in the marine wildlife. Military checkpoints proliferated across the United States, with Massachusetts no exception. The military routinely responded to food riots with violence, including the massacre at the Boston Police rationing site, where the 184th Infantry Regiment gunned down hungry Bostonians with impunity. In spite of the violence, the Boston Bugle continued to distinguish itself as a voice of reason, with dissident journalists continuing to cover the atrocities of the regime regardless of the risk to themselves. Additionally, a number of other military facilities and projects were based in the Commonwealth. The region was used as a major staging point for military aircraft. Fort Strong served as the development ground for the Fat Man portable nuclear launcher and the testing ground for the Army Corps of Engineer's T-51b power armor. Military outposts such as USAF Satellite Station Olivia and the National Guard training yard also dotted the landscape. The Defense Intelligence Agency operated unhindered across the state, operating the Switchboard and a network of hidden caches across the state, while the federal surveillance center K-21B monitored citizens for compliance. The Army, in cooperation with General Atomics, established the covert RB-2851 facility beneath East Boston, where prisoners would be harvested for use in Robobrains. As international tensions flared and the worldwide energy crisis erupted into the Resource Wars, the Commonwealth experienced an even higher military presence as the threat of Chinese infiltration and nuclear war drew closer. Echo Company of the 104th Infantry Regiment was subsequently deployed to man the South Boston military checkpoint, and began conducting mandatory inspections of all vehicles passing through it on August 1, 2077. While the inspections purported to detain \"suspicious elements,\" they discriminated against those of Chinese origin, many of who were already located in Chinese internment camps. Financial reports from this time indicated that increased military spending was coupled with a reduction in healthcare, utilities, and public transportation. Combined with rising energy costs as a result of the Resource Wars, along with hyperinflation and war-weariness gripping the country, especially after the annexation of Canada, public order became a serious issue, especially after images of U.S. atrocities were made public. Lieutenant Governor Graham eventually placed Boston under martial law, while American units serving in China and on the Anchorage frontline found themselves pulled back to deal with domestic unrest at home.\n\nFew survived the blast, besides those who were able to gain entry to the various vaults and bomb shelters located in Boston and the surrounding area. As Boston itself was not targeted directly, much of the city survived the initial bombardment relatively intact, including such locations as the Massachusetts State House, Boston Common and Fenway Park. The military attempted to maintain order in the aftermath, utilizing power armor to help quell unrest and transmitting emergency frequency RJ1138 over the airwaves to other Commonwealth Army soldiers promising food, shelter, and aid at the South Boston military checkpoint. With its command structure in tatters, however, the military eventually disbanded. The heads of various government sectors presumably survived the blast, at least initially, including the mayor of Boston who holed himself up at the Boston mayoral shelter. When the shelter was besieged by an angry mob, the mayor and his family perished. Ultimately, dwindling supplies, disrupted communication networks and the lack of a clear leadership structure prevented any form of organized government from reasserting control in the Commonwealth. The Commonwealth Institute of Technology was irreparably damaged. The science staff took refuge underground, slowly carving out subterranean habitat for themselves. The Institute was formally founded in 2110, as the children of the original survivors dug into the earth and built increasingly sophisticated habitats and laboratories, starting an ongoing process of expanding the Institute's facilities and infrastructure. Isolated from the outside world, the scientists continued their work, disregarding the mayhem and destruction occurring outside of its grounds. As they worked on creating synths, they attempted to work peacefully with the people of the Commonwealth using first generation synths, but mutual mistrust ended that relationship quickly and they returned to isolation. The key element of the future Commonwealth was founded at the ruins of Fenway Park stadium in the mid-2130s, when Diamond City was established. The settlement greatly benefited from its central location and the natural protection afforded by the baseball stadium, gradually rising to the position of the \"Great, Green Jewel of the Commonwealth\" and becoming an integral part of the region's history and its many factions.\n\nThe Minutemen came closest to becoming an organized army protecting the Commonwealth, rising to prominence after defending Diamond City from a super mutant attack in 2180 - the mutants being the first experiments released by the Institute into the wild as part of their research into organic synths. Their rising star was snuffed out in the middle of the 23rd century, after the loss of the Castle to mirelurks in 2240, after a sea creature attacked. The loss of their headquarters, radio station and General McGann sent the Commonwealth Minutemen into disarray. Without artillery support and their resources, they were picked off one by one. The formation of Goodneighbor by exiled individuals from Diamond City that same year also signaled a shift in the Commonwealth. The Broken Mask incident of 2229 and the revelation of third generation synths to the general population established the Institute as a bogeyman and contributed to the mutual distrust and paranoia that kept the communities of the Commonwealth divided. Since then the situation has remained tenuous. The Institute continued to experiment on the surface and use it as a source of raw materials for the expansion of its underground habitats, raiders and Gunners preyed on the people of the wasteland, too numerous to be killed off, but too disorganized to take over the Commonwealth, while the Minutemen atrophied. The Railroad conducted a guerrilla war against the Institute, desperately trying to stay one step ahead of the Institute's pursuit. However, the fertile soils of the region, its technological legacy and the ready availability of salvage meant that the region remained a crucial source of trade and resources. Tobar has once included it in his trading circuit, while caravans from the north, south, and west continue to pass through the region, contributing to the wealth of Bunker Hill and especially Diamond City. However, the region was still vulnerable to natural disasters, such as the brutal winter of 2286, when the Commonwealth suffered an enduring and perilous winter. Amidst the struggles of famished communities and frigid temperatures, a new faction of the Church of the Children of Atom emerged, with their following burgeoning as they propagated their veneration of nuclear fission and radiation throughout the area. Under the guidance of a mysterious prophet, the Last Son of Atom, the Church's forces schemed to instigate an all-encompassing conflict during the winter season against settlements bold enough to reject Atomic. They only survived thanks to a diverse group of survivors rallying and preventing a second nuclear conflagration. The following year delivered another blow to the situation, with the Gunners breaking the Minutemen at Quincy, and the Institute's hostile actions against Recon Squad Artemis triggering a conflict with the Brotherhood of Steel. Lexington and Northwest Commonwealth\nThis section of the Commonwealth has its borders roughly from Sanctuary Hills in the north, to the west foothills. To the east and south, this region ends at the elevated freeways, or at least what is left of them. In the southeast corner, at the congruity of the two freeways is Lexington, a gateway to the greater Boston area. Once a burgeoning landscape, this region still has the remains of suburbs and cities alike. Among the ruins are several settlements. Among them are Abernathy farm, Drumlin Diner and Tenpines Bluff. Due to the high traffic and relative safety, thanks to relatively low background radiation compared to the rest of the Commonwealth, this region is home to several raider gangs who prey on the caravan traffic.\n\nNorth Central Commonwealth\nThis section of the Commonwealth has its borders roughly established from the rolling foothills in the north, the south to the Mystic River, and the east and west by elevated freeways. This region was more developed the farther south traveled, at its center is the remains of the city of Malden. Although scarred by the Great War, this region along with the rest of the known Commonwealth was environmentally scarred by the greed and casual disregard of its inhabitants. One of the worst disasters was the case with Lake Quannapowitt. Once a popular fishing and swimming hole, this locale was used as a dumping ground by Mass Fusion. A local containment shed dumped waste via pipeline directly into its waters. The lake bottom is strewn with detritus and safety barrels.\n\nDespite the lake and its tributary, the Saugus River, becoming dangerously contaminated, it remains one of the more hospitable regions surrounding Boston, with the settlements of the Slog and Greentop Nursery having become stops on the caravan routes. Settlers, however, are not this region's only inhabitants. Super mutants and raiders have made their homes in several landmarks, overrunning – such as the case with Breakheart Banks – and threatening nearby settlements such as the Forged at Saugus Ironworks. The ominously named Parsons State Insane Asylum is also located here.\n\nWestern Commonwealth\nThis region consists of foothills to the west descending into the suburban neighborhoods of the greater Boston area to the east. Mostly wilderness, even before the war, it is dominated by the remains of Fort Hagen township to the west. Once flowing directly northeast is the Charles River, along a deep natural navigational channel that was devastated by the cataclysmic destruction of the southern Commonwealth. Along its riverfront lies the ruins of several townships and developments that have since been flooded by the change in water flow. Such is the case with the Forest Grove marsh, once a burgeoning town on the waterway, its lock and dam stuck in the closed position. The nearby Weston water treatment plant flooded due to a failure in its machinery, despite it being constructed below the waterline. Another instance of environmental destruction is the site of Jalbert Brothers Disposal.\n\nDespite this, the region is not without successful settlements. Graygarden was founded shortly before the war, and Oberland station, a recent farmstead built on the remains of a rail station, lies on the crest of the hillside east of the river. Among the ruins of the Mass Pike Interchange, the Gunners have constructed a major encampment. To the west is the ruins of the federal ration stockpile, once a place where the United States government stockpiled supplies, now a raider encampment. To the east is Vault 81, constructed near Chestnut Hillock Reservoir.\n\nCoastal Commonwealth\nOnce a vacation destination, as well as a destination for military and commercial interests. Salem, Nahant and Revere Beach lay on the shore, mostly abandoned due to a combination of raiders, feral ghouls and super mutants camped out at Revere satellite array. Natick and the Glowing Sea\nOne of the most desolate stretches of the Commonwealth, the Glowing Sea sits south of the township of Natick, covered in centuries worth of radioactive fallout, pollution, and torn apart by radioactive storms. The nuclear detonation at the Crater of Atom has devastated much of the state, making it uninhabitable to all but the Children of Atom. Precious facilities can be found in the Glowing Sea, but require special gear and preparation outside the ability of most Commonwealth denizens. The town of Natick sitting on the northern edge of the sea still has living fauna and flora, but the mutants pouring out of the sea and geological upheavals have driven the denizens off. Quincy and Southern Commonwealth\nThe areas south of the greater Boston neighborhoods, aside from the Glowing Sea, can be considered part of the Southern Commonwealth. Along rivers and treacherous marshlands, this region is the location of both West Roxbury and Jamaica Plain, two townships with their fair share of secrets. To the southeast is Quincy, which, like much of this zone, is under Gunner control. Some of the most dangerous areas in the entire Commonwealth include the coastal area past Quincy and the strange ruins of Spectacle Island, which may be an idyllic place for a settlement. \n\n Boston \nThe capital of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and one of the most densely urbanized areas on the eastern seaboard. It is a mix of centuries-old colonial architecture, civic and public buildings from the heyday of the United States, and expensive, high technology skyscrapers from its latter days. A vast network of elevated highways and monorails connected the city to the towns and districts beyond. Most of the city is abandoned and lies in ruins, although extensive reinforcement work, redundant draining systems, and excellent engineering prevented it from being reclaimed by the ocean, despite the near-constant fighting going on throughout the city. It is also home to three oases of peace: Diamond City, Bunker Hill and Goodneighbor, which also act as pillars of the region's economy.\n\nEnvironment\nA humid continental climate, the Great War has altered the Commonwealth in subtle ways, most noticeably an elevated ambient radiation count that increased environmental pressures and selected for mutated versions of local flora and fauna. The damage caused by the nuclear war and neglect caused much of the region's industrial facilities to deteriorate. However, while this has been negative for much of the region, such as when the nuclear reactors in the Glowing Sea exploded, contributing to the desolation, it was a boon in other places. For example, the derelict sewage treatment station at Warwick homestead actually created the most fertile soil in the Commonwealth when it broke. Even before the Great War, Massachusetts was suffering from widespread environmental pollution and devastation. Pressure and payoffs from companies such as Poseidon Energy and General Atomics International ensured that this pollution would go unreported. In one case, the Nahant Oceanological Society observed radiation and toxicity levels at Lake Quannapowitt that exceeded safe levels and showed a 1500% increase year over year. Exposure to such levels of pollution has resulted in rapidly increasing toxicity in marine species - including those fished for consumption - and increase in average mass by 14% in crabs and 12% in lobsters. The additional food necessary to sustain the shellfish population could lead to colony collapse and the implosion of marine ecosystems. When the Society tried to bring their findings of the growth and mutations to the press, Galaxy News Network simply reframed the news to be about how great the shellfish season was going to be. Like the rest of the United States, the changes in the ecosystem were due to a combination of factors, the most prevalent of which was the pollution and radiation. However, instead of reducing the number of plant types that could be grown, other mutated variants adapted to their place in the local environment(s). This can be seen with plants such as the tato, a plant that shares characteristics with the potato and tomato, and razorgrain, the popularity of which is due to its ability, unlike wheat, to be grown almost anywhere in the Commonwealth.  The Commonwealth has quite a fertile landscape, barring the areas where pollution and radiation are at their most extremes. Most towns are agriculturally stable, if not thriving, both due to trade, as well as various locations throughout the region suited to grow particular kinds of crops, from the Sunshine Tidings co-op, to Graygarden, and the Slog. The worst of such places where plant life is at its most scarce is the Glowing Sea, a vast and true wasteland. This radioactive landscape was birthed from the nuclear weapons that devastated the location and the continuous pollution from the destroyed nuclear power plants that dotted the area. The result of the vast mudslides of barren radioactive soil covers what once was a very populous area, burying whole communities and even elevated highways. This is where the region's radioactive storms originate, the effects of which continue to shower radioactive fallout across the Commonwealth. Pollution and radiation have affected the fauna of the region as well, resulting in the adaptation of existing species, including the development of creatures such as radstags, mirelurks (of which there are at least three species), bloodbugs, bloatflies and the brahmin. Other creatures have weathered the mutations, such as dogs and cats. While not common in the conurbation of the Greater Boston Area, wolves can be found in the greater region. One detail about the Commonwealth's fauna is that synthetic wildlife exists, created by the Institute under the Watcher Initiative and efforts to reintroduce pre-War wildlife to the surface.\n\nThe ecosystem of the Commonwealth, while peaceful for the most part, is occasionally disturbed by the super mutants. Like their Capital Wasteland \"cousins,\" these giant green beasts have a level of intelligence comparable to that of the Mariposa strain super mutants and are capable of constructing simple structures and armors, having a strength biased hierarchy, as well as operating tools of varying complexity. A fixture of the region since the Institute's FEV experimentation beginning in 2178, they became a permanent nuisance. However, production ceased sometime before 2287 due to Brian Virgil's sabotage of the FEV lab. Similarly to their D.C. brethren, they are considered pests, and are frequently hunted down. The Commonwealth lacks a centralized government unifying the various settlements that dot the region. The Institute is omnipresent in the region, directly or indirectly influencing the politics of the wasteland. The closest the region came to a stable government was with the Commonwealth Provisional Government (CPG), a proposed unified government for the region. The initiative met an abrupt end when representatives sent to Diamond City were all murdered by a synth. Since then, the various settlements across the Commonwealth have remained independent and forged their own path. Diamond City remained the biggest and most influential city thanks to a combination of effective governance by its democratically elected mayors, burgeoning economy, and defensive forces, remaining a vital hub for trade. Under Mayor McDonough, elected in 2282, this pattern continued, albeit the city's societal tranquility took a sharp turn for the worse that same year. Anti-ghoul rhetoric of the campaign culminated in the banishing of all ghouls into the surrounding wasteland. McDonough also adopted a hard anti-Minutemen stance, which only hastened the demise of the organization. McDonough was actually a synth infiltrator, sent to monitor the city and ensure it would not grow powerful enough to threaten the Institute. In contrast to the Institute is the Railroad, this underground movement was founded on the idea that synthetic people should have human rights. In their fight against what they perceive to be slavery have set up a shadow network of operators, to specifically fight the institution of machine slavery itself. In their efforts and failures, they influence some Commonwealth denizens in resistance against the Institute. Beyond Diamond City, Bunker Hill formed the second pillar of the region's economy, sitting on top of coastal trade routes. The income from caravans passing through the settlement and merchants operating out of the settlement allowed it to pay off the raider gangs operating in the area. Goodneighbor serves as another of Boston's major settlements, an anarchic haven for everyone who didn't fit in at Diamond City or Bunker Hill. Various gangs proliferated in the town, kept in check by John Hancock after his rise to power, while unrestricted trade in weapons, chems, and other vices grew. While neither Diamond City nor Bunker Hill had rules proscribing such trade, fees and taxes imposed by the mayor's office cut into profit margins, making trading in Goodneighbor (and smuggling into Diamond City) a profitable enterprise. Beyond these three, various settlements and factions operated across the Commonwealth, with various degrees of success. One of the most well known, the Commonwealth Minutemen, is a militia organized before 2180 and dedicated to the protection of the Commonwealth. Their faction entered a period of steep decline after the loss of the Castle, their headquarters and main armory, to a mirelurk horde in 2240. The fall culminated in 2287, after the town of Quincy was sacked by the Gunners and the last remaining Minuteman, Preston Garvey, led the survivors in an exodus across the Commonwealth, ending up in Concord with just five survivors in tow, besieged by raiders. The Gunners, on the other hand, rose to be a prominent faction in the Commonwealth thanks to a combination of military training and ruthlessness. As in many other regions, raiders continued to operate, forming a large number of uncoordinated warbands. Although various warlords such as Sinjin tried uniting them, these plans were universally stopped by character flaws, contractors hired by various major powers of the Commonwealth, or infighting. The largest of these raider armies formed in the ruins of Nuka-World, after enslaving its original residents, formed of three distinct gangs: the Operators, the Pack, and the Disciples, briefly united under Overboss Colter, before he was removed by the machinations of Porter Gage. In contrast to raiders, a new player to the region's power-politic has entered the wasteland. The Brotherhood of Steel already scouting the region, grew wary of their reports of the Institute and their synths. Seeing them as an abomination against mankind itself they established themselves at the abandoned Boston International Airport to destroy what they see as the next cataclysmic event against humanity and continue their mission of the preservation of technology as a whole.",

            "constant": false,
            "content": "The Railroad has been in existence since at the least the time of the creation of the first successful Generation-3 synths by Institute scientists around the 2220s. Following the public's discovery of the synths during the Broken Mask incident in Diamond City in 2229, the question if they deserve the same rights as natural humans became a major subject of debate, with frequent bickering between opposing sides. Many people believed that the Institute's synths were mere machines, just another model of advanced robot. Paranoia began to develop as local residents' loved ones vanished overnight and were replaced with artificial clones that eventually malfunctioned and went berserk, as with the case of Mr. Carter. Others, however, felt that synths deserved to be free, having being treated as slaves by their creators at the Institute. This is a point that makes some convinced that the synths are worthy of saving. It was from these ideals that the earliest possible incarnation of the Railroad would emerge. It is in evidence that the Railroad has been beaten down and reborn many times over the years, however its clandestine nature has ensured the group's survival in the long run. The earliest known incarnation of the Railroad, led by Agamemnon, was shut down in November 2266, by an Institute raid on their headquarters. Wyatt took the responsibility of rebuilding the organization from the ground up, after many of the members left following the HQ massacre. A runner named John D. was the sole survivor. In order to keep the Railroad alive, Wyatt chose to keep the site for the new headquarters hidden upon its discovery. Learning from the mistakes of his predecessor, he had figured out that once the Institute had attacked a safehouse, it would've been easy for them to track down the HQ, as so many people knew about it. It was from the remnants of this incarnation of the Railroad that the faction as it is known today came to be. By February of 2267, the revived Railroad, under the leadership of Wyatt, managed to get its first synth out of the Commonwealth. Under the motives of maintaining what he called \"operational security,\" John D. did not reveal the names of the new tourists he had found to help. Wyatt introduced multiple reforms to the Railroad's infrastructure. One of them was a clear hierarchy of gradually ascending power; a pyramid structure with independent tourists and sympathizers on the bottom, safehouse operators and runners third, field agents second, and finally HQ members on top. Furthermore, a dead drop system was established to create a more robust and secure method of communication between agents, safehouses and HQ. In a period when the Railroad was once again experiencing dark times, Pinky Thompson succeeded Wyatt's role as leader in December 2273, the latter having lost his life after the old headquarters was uncovered and sacked by Institute coursers. With the aid of Deacon, most of the survivors were able to make it out alive. After setting up shop at a new location, Pinky passed a new decree to tighten security at HQ, only giving heavies clearance to leave and ensuring that the organization moves to relay all packages out of the region as quick as possible.[6] He also recommended that all fugitive synths remain in custody of the Railroad until they are beyond the borders of the Commonwealth, following the assault on a homestead near Parsons State Insane Asylum by coursers, which resulted in the loss of a synth codenamed Lambda 8 and her spouse. When he received intel that a courser and a few other Institute operatives were on a mission taking them beyond the Commonwealth, Pinky assigned one of his agents, Victoria Watts, to shadow them on their trek south. She later settled down in the Capital Wasteland and rented an apartment in Rivet City to lie low while protecting the identity of a runaway, Harkness, aka A3-21. Having risen up the ranks of the local security force to become their commander, Harkness was at greater risk of being tracked down and reclaimed by the Synth Retention Bureau. The arrival of the bureau's head, Dr. Zimmer, and his synth escort Armitage, made the possibility of this threat more likely. It was then imperative that agent Watts was to remain in the area to serve as a bodyguard for Harkness.\n\nIn September 2276, Pinky's leadership started to come under pressure after the loss of another safehouse, Trinity. He later resigned from office and was succeeded by Desdemona, who won against Dr. Carrington in the election. The doctor became Dez's right-hand man. Immediately after Desdemona took office, the Railroad began to take a big step forward. The new leadership put focus on the fundamentals; operational security, lookouts, compartmentalization, and counterintelligence, analyzing and making improvements where Pinky went wrong. 2279 saw the arrival of Thomas Weatherby to HQ. Adopting the moniker \"Tinker Tom,\" Weatherby, a highly intelligent individual, designed new weapons and other useful technologies for the Railroad as part of a complete rearmament program. Desdemona and her aides also made improvements to the dead drop network and introduced the railsign system to allow agents to covertly mark cache, safehouse, and dead drop locations, as well as the presence of allies and potential dangers. Simply put, it was like Christmas for the organization. No coursers were on the radar during the year. In 2280, Glory, unit designation G7-81, a recently liberated synth, opted out of the memory wipe and joined the Railroad under the leadership of Desdemona. She was promoted to heavy the same year. The Railroad's current success streak ended in 2281, when the coursers discovered and razed another homestead to the ground. Yet, there were little casualties, and later that year, the faction's second heavy, Tommy Whispers, discovered the Switchboard. After moving HQ to there, Desdemona's agents uncovered the Predictive Analytic Machine, an advanced pre-War computer AI that would become a vital asset to the Railroad for years to come.  In 2283, an Institute insider named Liam Binet, under the alias \"PATRIOT,\" established contact with the outside world. Tinker Tom intercepted his messages and figured out his passphrase, which was \"Mass Fusion.\" From then on, Patriot became the Railroad's main contact in the Institute, although he himself is totally unaware of this connection for security reasons. The good streak persisted into 2286, with Institute sightings completely ceasing for three months and just four synths rescued. However, this was once again the calm before the storm, as the Institute was gearing up to activate its reactor, while the Brotherhood decided it was time to intervene and stop its preying on the Commonwealth. The Railroad is constructed like a pyramid, with the base composed of \"tourists\" (informants and sympathizers), above which stand runners and safehouse owners, then an even smaller group of field agents, and finally, the most secretive and heavily protected, the HQ members that have access to all the information and coordinates Railroad operations. All individuals answer to Desdemona. Field agents are given aliases in place of their real names in order to protect their identities and operate on a \"need-to-know\" basis to protect the Railroad.\n\nWhile the Railroad's main concern is helping synths, they are also known to work with groups such as the Abolitionists to assist runaway slaves. The Railroad's methods for aiding in escape can be extreme, going so far as to find doctors such as Horace Pinkerton and Amari to perform full facial reconstruction and mind wipes on escapees. Their current command center is located in the Old North Church in downtown Boston, after their previous base was compromised following a raid by the Institute. Their network of safe houses and clandestine contacts are reminiscent of their namesake, the 19th century Underground Railroad, which also helped slaves escape and reach free areas. As far as the Institute is concerned, androids are mere machines with no free will of their own that exist only to serve their creators.  However, the Railroad stands by the doctrine that, even as machines, self-aware androids look, behave, think and feel as humans do, entitling them to the freedom intrinsically enjoyed by human beings as well as emancipation from their owners. However, while the Railroad wishes to help Gen 3 synths, members are divided on Gen 1 and 2 synths, with some not wishing to aid the earlier models because they argue they are more robotic than sentient. The Railroad also occasionally assists human slaves when able, although they cite that there are many other abolitionist groups specifically focused on slaves, but no other group can aid with the unique challenges of concealing androids. To this end, the Railroad employs the skills of computer science experts to alter the memories of the android to provide them with a clean slate, as well as the skills of a plastic surgeon to conceal the android's true identity. A Railroad branch in the Capital Wasteland recently aided an android (designation A3-21), but the operation was so risky that the branch had to temporarily shut down to keep its members safe until Commonwealth investigators abandoned the manhunt. Though the Railroad is a spy organization that prefers stealth and sabotage, it does maintain a small but well-equipped fighting force. Railroad agents that specialize as frontline soldiers are known as \"heavies.\" They are responsible for the defense of Railroad safehouses and escaped synths should they be attacked by enemy forces. They commonly make use of Gauss rifles or railway rifles and wear armored coats.\n\nAgents infiltrate organizations and towns and collect intel, and use surveillance devices placed at high vantage points. This gives the Railroad a powerful information network. Agents also serve a support role in establishing safe houses, stashing supplies, marking locations with railsigns and sabotaging enemy fortifications. They also have a network of non-members that assist them by providing safe harbor, money or manpower; they call these individuals \"tourists.\"  The Railroad lacks the industrial base and refinement of the Institute, the firepower and armor of the Brotherhood of Steel, or the popular support of the Minutemen, forcing it to rely on what it can salvage or create on its own. For much of its known history, the Railroad was forced to get by with relatively low-tech weapons and gear merely adapted for their purposes. This situation changed completely with the introduction of Tinker Tom into headquarters. Best described as a suffering genius, Tom has revolutionized the Railroad's technological edge, introducing a slew of purpose-built weapons, armor, and tools. The standardized Railroad armored coats issued to heavies finally boasted proper levels of protection, while custom weapons like the Deliverer ensured they had tools matching their skillset. For non-combat purposes, Tom has introduced the MILA, a complex surveillance device whose precise workings seem to be a mystery even to its inventory, but which ensures a steady stream of intel right into its headquarters. The other crucial asset, at least in 2287, is P.A.M., whose predictive capabilities and processing power were crucial to its survival. Processing data provided to it by Railroad field operatives, P.A.M. provides the organization with locations of DIA caches, coursers to eliminate, and helps in planning operations so that they are as safe and effective as possible. Finally, through its associates, the Railroad has access to expert medical, electronic, and computer services. These allow for the robust modification of body types and faces (exploited by Deacon), modifying synth memories, and everything else necessary to protect the synths.",

            "content": "The Institute is an elusive scientific society based in the Commonwealth. Founded in 2110 by survivors from the Commonwealth Institute of Technology and their descendants, the Institute considers itself a bastion of knowledge and prosperity amid a dying world, and by 2287 has developed numerous revolutionary and advanced technologies such as teleportation and synthetic humans.\n\nDisdainful of the outside world, they aim to monitor and control the Commonwealth through both subterfuge and brute force, to ensure their work is not disrupted. This secretive and hostile attitude has turned the Institute into a \"boogeyman\" in the wasteland, and its presence is a major cause of paranoia for the people of the Commonwealth. The Institute was built upon the site of the former Commonwealth Institute of Technology, or C.I.T.  While the college itself laid in ruins for more than two centuries, at the time of the Great War, those present took refuge underground. The Institute was formally founded by the children of the original survivors, who dug into the earth and built increasingly sophisticated residential facilities and laboratories, starting an ongoing process of infrastructure expansion. Isolated from the outside world, the scientists continued their work, disregarding the mayhem and destruction occurring outside of its grounds. As they worked on creating synths, they attempted to work peacefully with the people of the Commonwealth using first generation synths as well as help create a new stabilized government, but mutual mistrust and infighting ended that relationship quickly and they returned to isolation. Eventually, the scientists have utterly put ubiquitous pre-War technology to shame, to the point where they believed that wastelanders would be unlikely to understand the sheer scope of the Institute's achievement, such as the creation of the molecular relay (teleporter) in the 2180s, which resulted in the Institute sealing itself off from the surface permanently, and the development of synths. For decades, the first and second generation synths were the most visible part of the Institute's operations, scavenging for materials and performing experiments on the wasteland. The scientists did not concern themselves with the effect their actions had on the surface, sometimes resulting in entire settlements being destroyed. However, the Institute eventually reached the limits of the synth technology that underpinned their society. Although powerful, the second generation synth was an inherently limited, mechanical platform. To overcome the limitations of metal synthetic materials, the Institute endeavored to create synthetic flesh, with the first research initiative beginning in 2178. Under the auspices of Doctor Frederick, FEV samples served as the starting point for the new, organic synthetic program despite the objections of some members of BioScience. Research slowed in March 2224, as the research team concluded that the organic synth project could not proceed despite perfecting two FEV strains for the project. Radiation-induced hereditary damage proved too much of an obstacle. The solution came in 2227, with the acquisition of a baby named Shaun who had an undamaged pre-War genetic code. Shaun was abducted from his parents in Vault 111 by Institute mercenary Conrad Kellogg. The organic synth project was spun off from the FEV research initiative, and his DNA became the basis of the third generation synths. The infant Shaun became \"Father\" to a whole family of engineered synthetic beings.\n\nTwo incidents caused the Institute to have a negative perception by the surface dwellers. In 2229, a defective synth caused the Broken Mask Incident in Diamond City, vilifying the Institute in the eyes of the Commonwealth, and causing no small amount of internal problems for the Institute, as he was sent out without proper testing or approval. During the 2230s, the Massacre of the CPG occurred in which the Institute killed people trying to create a stable Commonwealth government.\n\nBy 2266, the Institute had learned about the Railroad, an organization dedicated to helping escaped synths. The Institute raided and massacred the Railroad's headquarters, and murdered their leader Wyatt in 2273. The FEV research effort continued for several more decades, despite producing no useful data; except for manufacturing more super mutants for the surface to contend with. When Brian Virgil succeeded Dr. Syverson as head of the project in April 2286, it became evident that FEV experimentation ran its course and served no useful purpose, not with the availability of third generation synths. The Institute's experiments with the Forced Evolutionary Virus, or FEV, ended when Doctor Virgil went rogue and fled into the Commonwealth. The Institute is constantly facing shortages in its power budget, in no small part due to the fact that the molecular de-materializer (the only way in and out of the facility) requires immense amounts of power for each use. Moreover, despite the luster of the Institute's facilities, a lot of the crucial facilities (particularly the reactor) are pre-War technology and despite continued maintenance requires increasing amounts of resources to keep running after two centuries of expansion. The technology still holds up, as it was built to last. To overcome at least one problem, the ultimate goal of the Institute is energy independence, which they believe can be achieved by restarting the ancient nuclear reactor once used by the C.I.T. to perform experiments and providing the Institute with near limitless power. The design has been revised and the reactor itself extensively upgraded and improved, turning it from a testing reactor into a proper source of electricity. Activating it would free the Institute from the need to compromise and sacrifice, and especially drawing power from above-ground installations. The Institute allows humans to live in a clean, safe, comfortable environment deep underground, free from the strife and environmental hazards present on the surface.  Their headquarters is located underneath the C.I.T. ruins. Over the decades of isolation and development, the Institute has developed a very effective system that maximizes efficiency and promotes individual development and research. The leadership over the Institute is in the hands of the directorate, made up of the individual heads of each division, and one specially-appointed director. The divisions of the Institute are fairly autonomous, perfectly capable of functioning without intervention. Where those divisions interact, however, problems can arise. As such, the director is appointed to set policy, resolve disputes, and otherwise act as an intermediary. Each director heads a division that is instrumental to the Institute's continued existence. On the other hand, despite the pressing need for cooperation, knowledge is heavily compartmentalized and the divisions are often kept in the dark by each other or by Father regarding important information. Inconvenient facts are routinely buried under pretenses, especially when it comes to high-profile members fleeing the organization, like Dr. Brian Virgil. Due to the fact that the Institute exists in isolation from sunlight, there is an artificial time cycle implemented to simulate a day-night cycle. \"Quiet time\" for resting runs from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. Headed by Madison Li, the Advanced Systems division works on applied physics (plasma weaponry and teleportation), as well as special projects currently classified. They are also responsible for the advanced weapons and armor that the synths and Institute members wear on their trips to the surface. They run the Robotics lab, which produces new synths. Their primary focus is the implementation of Phase Three, an upgrade to the Instute's massive fusion reactor that would completely solve their power needs for the foreseeable future. Headed by Clayton Holdren, the BioScience division specializes in fields of study such as botany, genetics and medicine. They are also responsible for all biotech advancements, including crop production, pharmaceuticals and genetic engineering. They also hold samples of the Forced Evolutionary Virus, which was responsible for creating super mutants. Rumor has it that they are working on a way to reverse engineer the virus to create a cure. Their most important directive is to ensure the health and well-being of everyone in the Institute. To that end, they cultivate highly specialized breeds of flora for use in food and medicine, providing the majority of the Institute's food. They have even started to explore the idea of synthetic animal life. Currently experimenting with replicated gorillas, the synthanimal initiative is just a pet project, but the potential is considered exciting. A thoroughly underappreciated branch of the Institute, the Facilities division under Allie Filmore is responsible for keeping the Institute in operation on a day-to-day basis. It performs daily tasks like servicing the life support systems, ventilation, and the power network. All the old technology that forms the foundation of the Institute's efforts requires constant maintenance to prevent blackouts, which can have lethal consequences for the sequestered society. In a nutshell, they keep the Institute's mechanical and electrical systems running smoothly. They maintain and upgrade all of the systems that make it possible to live and work in a place like the Institute's underground habitat: Crucial apparatus that recycles the air and water and provides power to the laboratories and quarters. The work they do might not be as exciting as some of the other departments, but it's at least as important. They have a large number of first generation synths used for maintenance duties. They are simple, but effective tools for keeping the Institute in operation. Members of the division include the aforementioned Allie Filmore, division head (or chief engineer, as some would call her), Doctor Lawrence Higgs, a mechanical engineer overseeing the major life support and security systems, Doctor Evan Watson in power distribution, and Doctor Newton Oberly, responsible for food and housing. He liaisons with BioScience to ensure that meals are balanced for optimal nutrition. Headed by Alan Binet, Robotics is a branch of the Institute responsible for the manufacture of synths. Currently focused on mass production and induction of third generation synths, it is also responsible for processing upgrades that ensure synths remain functional at optimal capacity. Currently, the division is implementing existing upgrades. Headed by Justin Ayo, the SRB was designed to perform one task: it tracks down and returns rogue synths to the Institute. To do this, the Institute created a specific synth model called the Courser. Coursers have their personality levels tweaked to ensure they won't rebel, while their combat abilities have been vastly improved over other models. Other divisions within the Institute fear the SRB, as they have a hit squad of Coursers under their command and they are very effective in their role. The SRB also works to hunt down Railroad members so they can shut down the rebel organization once and for all. The SRB also employs a murder, or flock, of \"Watchers,\" synthetic crows with built-in monitoring devices. Synths are the primary labor force of the Institute, but the more advanced their processing becomes, the more inevitable that the synth will attain consciousness and attempt escape. As third generation synths are indistinguishable from normal biological humans, the Synth Retention Bureau specializes in the capture of runaways. The primary instrument of the SRB is the Courser, a third-generation synth assigned to operate on the surface. Coursers hunt down and reclaim synths that have escaped the Institute. They are highly self-sufficient, trained in combat, infiltration, and tracking. In a word, Coursers are relentless.  Coursers are selected from the general third generation synth population. Due to the variability of the manufacturing process, the SRB constantly monitors the third generation population looking for tenacity, fearlessness, and independence. Synths selected to undergo a rigorous training regimen. They are taught armed and unarmed combat, investigative techniques, psychology, and mechanical skills. Those who pass a final evaluation become Coursers, re-registered as X synths (eg. X6-88). The rest have their memories wiped and return to their former duties. Synths are usually recovered by using a recall code to wipe their memories and render it inert. Once returned to the Institute, the delicate process of restoring the neural pathways to their original configuration begins. In those cases where the procedure is successful, the synth returns to duty with no memory of its time on the surface. All too often, the SRB staff is unable to repair the damage and is forced to dispose of the unit entirely. Another priority of the SRB is surveillance, achieved by using watchers to monitor the surface remotely and covertly. Formed by the descendants of teachers and students from the Commonwealth Institute of Technology, the Institute reflects generations of devotion to technological achievement and vision. The survivors and their descendants built an impressive underground fortress, complete with virtually all the material abundance they could need, even exceeding pre-War conditions in some respects. As time progressed, they coalesced around a small ruling body made up of the division heads (Facilities, Robotics, Advanced Systems, Synth Retention, and BioScience) chaired by the Director, an elected official who sets the near-term vision and strategy of the institute.\n\nHowever, this exterior of safety and abundance belies the organization's absolute self-interest: to protect their secrecy, autonomy, and technology at all costs. As such, society in the institute reflects generations of isolation, elitism, and moral hypocrisy. While the current director, \"Father,\" claims that the Insititute desires to be benefactors to the Commonwealth, they ruthlessly scavenge resources, siphon power, and relentlessly pursue escaped synths. When confronted, most Institute members will rationalize that the ends justify the means: individual raids and minor pilfering of the Commonwealth are necessary for the development of new technologies and synths to (eventually) \"benefit\" the people. This philosophy echoes their vision that one day the Institute will emerge from seclusion to take a leadership role in the Commonwealth, distributing the wealth of their advancements as a technocracy.\n\nDespite the Institute's prowess, there are a limited amount of scientists at its disposal, with a small team working with each division and several auxiliary scientists elsewhere. As a result, the Institute requires relatively little housing space and has apartments to accommodate all scientists and their families. Scientists interact regularly and often spend time inside the cafeteria and main chamber, supplemented by the numerous Gen 1, 2, and 3 synths who perform any and all maintenance tasks required to preserve the Institute facilities and infrastructure.\n\nDue to the generational nature of the Institute, their existing scientists show considerable intelligence and motivation for technical achievement -- \"geniuses\" in the truest sense. Members of each division have continued pursuits in their fields, having met or exceeded the pre-War status of those professions. However, they are deeply mistrustful of outsiders (that is, anyone physically outside of the Institute) and lack a firm grasp of societal nuances outside the institute; as such, they employ a limited number of specialists to handle outside jobs, such as escort of Institute scientists, recruitment, and assassination, since the sheltered life and devotion to science have made them less capable of physical confrontation and negotiation necessary to survive.\n\nIn spite of the Institute's relative abundance compared to the outsided world, its inhabitants are frequently pushy and demanding, particularly to the Gen 1 and Gen 2 synths who perform menial labor throughout the Institute. Passing conversation is often filled with verbal abuse, with inhabitants condescending to the problem-solving skills of Gen 1s or threatening to shut down Gen 2s for sub-par performance. Scientists freely use Gen 3 synths as test subjects for dangerous experiments, since they are nearly identical to humans in most regards.\n\nDespite its secrecy, the Institute has both adopted and recruited outsiders to join their ranks. The current director, Father, was adopted as an infant and raised within the Institute. Others, like Dr. Madison Li, are recruited due to their intellect, achievements, and similar views on pursuing independent research without interference. With those they have accepted, the Institute maintains a friendly and welcoming demeanor.\n\nWhile the Institute does have a working economy, there is little buying and trading taking place outside of designated areas and products from the outside world are limited. There appear to be no strict work hours for most scientists, as they often take many hours off and come and go as they please from meals; even so, the scientists are remarkably productive, with several working tirelessly for the next big \"breakthrough\" in their research. The Institute is very secretive of the projects occurring within its organization and seeks to keep as much information internally as possible. This leads to it limiting outside contact as much as possible without compromising the security of the facility. Of course, security is an exception and the Institute's SRB operates a network of informants in the entire Commonwealth, monitoring developments to ensure they cannot threaten the Institute. Another exception is its scientific experiments. While it seeks to minimize direct contact, the Institute has no reservations about using the surface for its experiments and as a source of readily available raw materials. All research initiatives are meticulously documented with academic precision, from hypothesis to the conclusions. For example: Warwick homestead was targeted to test genetically-modified seeds in the unique climate of the Commonwealth, in order to ascertain whether ambient radiation, soil acidity and its fertility found there could provide an accelerated growth rate and a two-fold increase in size and thus yield. Though ostensibly harmless, the research initiative involved abducting Roger Warwick and processing him to gain intelligence, then using Roger's replica to oversee the experiment, collect research data and eventually eliminate all evidence of the research initiative on the surface. he Institute's activities on the surface go beyond agricultural research. Past projects also involved other bioengineered experiments, including diseases and FEV-induced mutations. Abductions remain a routine element of these research activities. Finally, anyone who holds anything of value to the Institute, especially technology and research data, are vulnerable. University Point was an example of this: When Jacqueline Spencer uncovered pre-War research on reactor efficiency and tried to find a buyer via a caravan, the Institute picked up the trail and a synth representative demanded that the town hand it over. When the settlement failed to comply, due to the chaos that broke out and Spencer being separated from the drive by her well-intentioned father, the SRB wiped the town out. The Institute also attempts to procure data from rival polities, like the Brotherhood, whenever it can, in order to maintain its technological advantage. While the Institute is primarily a scientific group, it has a powerful army at its disposal: synths. Inside the main HQ of the Institute, the Robotics division can produce very large numbers of synthetic organisms, which can be very efficient foot soldiers with enhanced strength and resilience. This, coupled with the advanced technology at their disposal, makes the Institute's synths a serious threat to anyone who dares to oppose them. Generation 1 and 2 synths serve as the backbone of forces, equipped with variants of the Institute laser gun, shock batons, and synth armor.\n\nCoursers are a particular type of Generation 3 synth with higher military capability, used as special agents to pursue and recover lost synths, and as special forces. They are trained and deployed by the Synth Retention Bureau. Coursers are equipped with variants of the Institute laser gun, the signature Courser coat, and synth relay grenades that allow them to teleport Generation 1 synths to help them in combat. They commonly utilize Stealth Boys.\n\nThey maintain an information network to assist them in strategy. The Synth Retention Bureau maintains a fleet of watchers, synth crows with internal cameras. From the SRB, scientists monitor live feeds from locations all across the Commonwealth with these. The SRB also inserts synth agents into positions of importance (such as the mayor of Diamond City and the leader of a successful homestead) and maintains a network of paid informants, such as merchants and bartenders.\n\nThey are the only faction in the Commonwealth with access to teleportation, and this is a military advantage. They can attack a location with zero warning at any time and leave before backup arrives. For this reason, they excel at hit-and-run tactics. The Institute is one of the most technologically advanced factions in the wasteland. Their primary and most notable achievement is the ability to field an army of synthetic entities and eliminate the need for menial labor, with the latest third generation models being not only indistinguishable from humans, but also immune to disease, able to subsist on minimal energy intake without loss of performance, and do not require sleep. Moreover, the Institute can assemble them at a rapid pace within its Robotics laboratory, from scratch. The Institute has constructed an entire subterranean habitat after the Great War when most humans struggle and get by with shacks and tents. Not only that, but it can also manufacture its own energy weapons and advanced armor in numbers large enough to outfit all of its security forces. Furthermore, it uses genetically modified crops to provide sustenance for its researchers. As a result, safe, pure water and food is also commonly available to all members of the Institute. Food synthesizers help provide a balanced diet, with additional luxury goods scavenged by synths from the topside, such as Nuka-Cola, Gwinnett beer and coffee among others. The Institute had a large advantage, having emerged out of the ashes of one of the most advanced centers of research and development in the world. Most of its achievements are still deeply rooted in the C.I.T. For example, its security system architecture is derived from the C.I.T. Code Defender, a revolutionary intrusion countermeasure system developed before the Great War. Terminals running the original version of the system still remain in the Institute's inventory, despite advances made by the SRB. Another impressive achievement of the Institute is its development of teleportation technology. The only other factions known to possess similar technology are the Think Tank and the Zetan aliens. Unlike the Think Tank, however, the Institute is able to teleport multiple individuals in rapid succession.\n\nIn the past, the Institute has also worked on cybernetics and artificial prolongation of the human lifespan. Its only test subject was Conrad Kellogg, as the program was abandoned and forgotten, save for the jealousy the grizzled mercenary inspired in Institute scientists due to his life span. Father terminated the project as he believed that the Institute was about preserving humanity rather than the fusion of biology and technology that cybernetics was poised to create.",

            "content": "Coursers are elite synth operatives designated to carry out specific surface missions for the Institute, such as tracking down escaped synths. They operate around the Commonwealth in 2287. The primary instrument of the Synth Retention Bureau is the courser, a third-generation synth assigned to operate on the surface. Coursers hunt down and reclaim synths that have escaped the Institute. They are highly self-sufficient, trained in combat, infiltration, and tracking. In a word, coursers are relentless. The Institute has used such hunter synths since at least 2277, when one such unit, A3-21, was considered by Dr. Zimmer (then director of the SRB) to be the most advanced synth ever created for the time.\n\nSources vary as to how coursers are created. According to Justin Ayo, current director of the SRB, Coursers are drawn from the third generation synth population: the SRB constantly monitors the gen 3 synth pool for tenacity, fearlessness, and independence. When synths are identified with these traits, they are then trained in espionage, investigation, psychology, combat, and mechanical skills. Those who pass a final evaluation for this regimen become coursers, while those who fail have their memories wiped and return to their former duties. On the other hand, a conversation between Max Loken and other scientists in the Robotics division suggests that Coursers are specially-manufactured synth units, or at least that general synths can be designed to be more suitable for courser work. Regardless, successful courser candidates receive specialized hardware and software upgrades to suit their role. Their cranial synth implant is upgraded with a courser chip to relay them into and out of the Institute, and they also receive other upgrades (such as improved musculature and targeting software) for combat purposes.\n\nThe SRB primarily uses coursers to retrieve and reset escaped synths. Once an escaped synth is found, a courser uses the synth's recall code to wipe its memories and render it inert. Once done, the synth is brought back to the Institute to have its neural pathways restored and regulated back to its original functions, wiping its memories of its time on the surface, although numerous cases involve irreparable damage and the disposal of many escaped synths. However, coursers are also given other missions, such as eliminating enemy targets or making contact with other field operatives. They are noted by the Railroad and the Institute to be exceptional even for synths, as they possess exceptional strength, combat prowess, awareness, and endurance. They are widely feared by the Railroad, as their first instinct when they see a courser is to cease all operations and remain low.  ",

            "content": "Synth (short for synthetic humanoids, also called androids or artificial humans) is a common term used to refer to the robotic and biomechanical beings manufactured within the Institute's laboratories. While Generation 1 and 2 synths are entirely mechanical designs utilizing simplistic AIs, Generation 3 synths produced from the late 2220's onward are biological constructs near-indistinguishable from humans, and are frequently sent to abduct and replace residents of the Commonwealth for espionage purposes.\n\nDespite their creators' insistence to the contrary, Generation 3 synths display signs of sentience and frequently attempt to escape the Institute, with the Synth Retention Bureau hunting down any that succeed.\n\nWhile viewed with suspicion and paranoia by most wastelanders (particularly the Brotherhood of Steel, who consider them an existential threat to humanity), some view them with sympathy, such as the Railroad, who compare their treatment at the hands of the Institute to slavery. Many synths are unaware that they are synths, having pre-programmed selected memories. Both android and synth are technically correct terms, used interchangeably by the Institute to refer to its creations. The former term has been deprecated at Shaun's insistence, following the introduction of third generation models. Synths are all issued a four character identification number when processed and assigned duties. It always begins with a letter, followed by a number, dash and two more numbers. Synths have been manufactured by the Institute for decades, with no precise date as to when first generation synths were fielded to the Commonwealth; however, it was at a time when the Institute had not yet become the major bogeyman of the region and were able to continue their work in relative peace. Further attempts to work peacefully with the native inhabitants of the Commonwealth eventually culminated in mutual mistrust that ended any possible relationships between the two rather quickly. By the 2170s, the first generation synths were no longer enough for the Institute's needs, and in order to overcome the limitations of limited and nonrenewable materials, the Institute endeavored to create synthetic flesh, so that their creations could more safely traverse the above world. Research into this officially began in 2178 under the auspices of Doctor Frederick, on F.E.V. samples, despite the objections of some senior members of the BioScience division. Both women and men were abducted from the Commonwealth and submerged in the Institute's modified FEV, their mutations carefully tracked and extensively investigated. Successful mutations were monitored to ensure survivability, then tagged and discarded. The research was intended to produce effective synthetic organics, but it ground to a halt in March 2224, as the research team concluded that the organic synth project could not proceed despite perfecting two FEV strains for the project. Radiation-induced hereditary damage proved too much of an obstacle. Just three years later, in 2227, the organic synth project was spun off from the FEV research initiative due to the acquisition of Shaun and his undamaged pre-War genetic code. He was recovered by Conrad Kellogg, and his DNA became the basis of the third generation of synths in a project led by Dr. Walter. The infant Shaun became \"Father\" to a whole family of engineered synthetic beings.\n\nTests were not without setbacks; in May 2229, a defective 3rd generation infiltrator caused the Broken Mask incident in Diamond City, vilifying the Institute in the eyes of the Commonwealth. The synth, which called itself Mr. Carter, was a prototype that was field tested without the Institute director's approval. After an apparent malfunction, Carter went on a shooting spree, murdering at least four people before being brought down by Diamond City Security and revealed to be a synth. Though the Institute did not actually intend to massacre the people of Diamond City, the people of Diamond City have feared and resented the Institute ever since. Nick Valentine and DiMA are unique synths, both being prototype synths intended to bridge the gap between the Gen 2 synths and the truly sapient Gen 3 synths. While DiMA was made to freely develop a personality from experience, Nick's personality was built upon the mind of a pre-War detective who had his mind encoded from a pre-War brain scan, giving him all of the memories and experiences of his namesake. The two of them escaped the Institute together, but due to the limited memory space of their prototype brains, Nick's memory of the escape was deleted. This led him to believe that he was thrown out by the Institute. DiMA later traveled to the Island and founded the synth refuge of Acadia with Faraday. As DiMA reached the limit of remaining space in his prototype brain, he began to artificially increase his memory capacity by storing his memories in connected computers. The Synth Retention Bureau is a branch of the Institute tasked with tracking and capturing escaped synths. Coursers are elite gen-3 synth hunters and operatives trained to carry out specific surface missions for the Institute, recruited by the SRB from synths observed to be exceptionally tenacious and independent. The first models created by the Institute are skeletal creatures with an unmistakable provenance. Patterned after the human silhouette, their basic chassis consists of a human-like skeleton constructed from alloys, with the power cell and additional mechanisms stored where the chest cavity would be, while visual receptors and the primary processing unit are contained within the artificial skull. Limbs are minimalist, articulated by a network of tensile fibers, simulating muscle action, like in early human prostheses. In practice, first generation synths are simple, yet effective machines. They are employed by The Institute for menial labor within the Institute, maintaining the hundreds of systems keeping the underground habitat in operation, and performing tasks that can be easily automated. Like all robots, they can take large amounts of damage, almost never backing down from a fight even with their limbs blown off. What the Gen 1 synths lacked in ability or strength compared to later models, they made up for in expendability and numbers, always capable of being replaced by the Institute. While capable of recognizing human speech and interpreting commands given to them, they require careful programming and instructing, as well as patches to keep them in operation. The most notorious functionality of first generation synths is navigational software, which requires frequent patching and fixing. Pathfinding software frequently causes first generation synths to try to walk through walls. The most common variant of mechanical synth in the Commonwealth, second generation synthetics are essentially Gen 1 synths provided with a suite of upgrades to their mechanisms and programming. The most noticeable difference is the inclusion of an internal mesh that shields the mechanisms of the synth from damage and provides support for the artificial skin layer that makes the Gen 2 similar to a human. Though more humanoid in appearance, Gen-2s still possess limited A.I. and superficially resemble a mannequin more than a human. These synths are often found dressed in synth armor when on the surface, or else in Institute jumpers when working down in the Institute. They also speak in a robotic voice, but at a much lower pitch than Gen 1 synths.\n\nThe Gen 2 synths work in maintenance roles within the Institute but are also used on the surface, where their artificial skin layer and improved mechanics improve their performance well above that of Gen 1s. On the surface, Gen 2 synths are the primary workhorses of scouting operations and scavenging missions. They are feared, as they are usually witnessed stripping entire settlements down for parts and killing everything that gets in their way. One of the latest targets of a Gen 2 stripping unit was University Point, which saw its population exterminated for resources after failing to hand over a girl the Institute mistakenly believed was in possession of pre-War energy research. Of course, due to their mechanical nature, mechanical synthetics can suffer from major software bugs, such as remaining in a single room executing its duties in a loop due to faulty navigation software. Other failures are typically mechanical in nature, with their servo motors and drives breaking down due to age. In fact, most second generation synths have lasted long past their projected lifespans, with all the bugs that crop up due to overuse. The most advanced synthetics created by the Institute are fundamentally different from their predecessors. Despite the sequential numbering, they are unrelated to their mechanical counterparts. Third generation synths are derived from Shaun's pre-War DNA extensively modified using the Institute's own research into the Forced Evolutionary Virus, combining the advantageous adaptations encoded into FEV with the versatility of the human body shape. This allowed the Institute to create varieties of synths of different races and appearances despite the base DNA coming from only one source. They are the result of nearly five decades of research, from 2178 to 2227. Third generation synthetics represent the pinnacle of synth technology, being virtually indistinguishable from natural-born humans right down to the cellular level. Each Gen 3 synth is built from lab-grown bones, muscles, and other tissues that are assembled and brought to life at the Institute's Robotics lab, and are \"born\" with the bodies and mental faculties of full-grown adult humans. Though entirely biological, each Gen 3 synth contains a neurological implant inside their brain allowing them to be \"programmed\" and manipulated via voice commands. This implant cannot be detected or removed without killing the synth. Synths can also have additional components installed, such as neuro-servos and other implants. Third generation synthetics are unlike humans in some respects, and some liberated synths do not consider themselves human at all. The reasons for this are multiple; chief among them is the assembly process. Max Loken suggests that synths do not require sleep at all to function properly (although Gen 3 synth companions are shown to sometimes sleep) and need not \"fear\" hunger or disease (though he does not mention thirst or breathing). This is in conflict with Curie, who mentions needing to sleep and eat when in her synth body; to some degree, it appear that synths can still maintain these functions even if not required. They may even specifically want to eat, such as the case of third generation synths' shared affinity for Fancy Lads Snack Cakes. Generation 3 synths are physically and mentally indistinguishable from ordinary humans, having lab-grown bodies of real human flesh, bones, and organs instead of plastic and metal. As Dr. Roslyn Chambers found, no medical tests or procedures can identify someone as a synth without killing them (synths that infiltrate settlements, for example, only drop synth components when killed). Psychological tests, such as Covenant's SAFE test, are dubious at best. However, they are not perfect duplicates and have a few key differences from humans that are not immediately obvious: synths do not age, may or may not require sleep, and will not normally gain or lose weight (Mayor McDonough was specifically designed to be obese to match the human he replaced). Many denizens of the Commonwealth have become paranoid and prejudiced against synths, fearing they might be abducted by the Institute and replaced with identical copies of themselves. Their paranoia is justified, as some of the most sophisticated synths encountered act as spies and could fool the unaware. The synths' Institute creators view them as nothing more than machines and treat them as slaves. The Railroad has committed itself to freeing Generation 3 synths from their masters and smuggling them out of the Commonwealth to somewhere the Institute cannot reach them. In contrast, the Brotherhood of Steel has sworn to eliminate all synths, for to them, a machine capable of thinking like a man is an abomination of technology and cannot be allowed to exist, likening the lack of ethics used to create them to that of decadent pre-War corporations.\n\nGen 1 and 2 synths are less intelligent than Gen 3 synths, but display a certain level of sapience, as exemplified in their dialogue. They call out to their target \"whoever you are, I know you're there\" and will comment that their systems may be in need of recalibration if they lose track of a target. While most synths are Gen 1 or Gen 2 and are thus allied to the Institute, they can also be encountered in other places.",

            "content": "One of the most widespread and popular models in RobCo Industries' catalogue, the Protectron was designed as an inexpensive work drone, capable of performing a wide variety of tasks from construction, through security, to office duties. Produced from at least 2063, it's a compact, bipedal work drone with a pair of manipulators and integrated lasers for self-defense. The large dome contains the primary optic sensors (usually three) and the central processing unit that contains the robot's synthetic personality. For ease of maintenance, the Protectron is typically powered by a fission battery.  As it was not intended for combat, at least not as a direct combatant, the Protectron only has a thin alloyed shell meant to protect its internal components from the environment and damage that could be sustained in the course of its duties. However, the internal temperature of certain Protectrons can reach up to 1000 degrees for cooking foods, giving them extreme internal heat resistance. The head assembly is typically shielded by a semi-transparent or opaque dome from reinforced glass. Although various hardware modifications were introduced before the war to enhance its effectiveness. Apart from the standard body, RobCo also offered construction drones with a shielded, reinforced head, emergency light, and internal power tools like nailguns. Firefighter models with an internal cryo gun for fire suppression and additional protection from fire and debris. Medic units with built-in defibrillators and reinforced police models with tasers, stronger servomotors, and armored heads. Even factory models could be customized with a variety of software and synthetic personalities to enhance its performance. This ability to customize made it a popular choice for both the private and public sectors. These included the R04 V9 \"Office Helper\" personality \nwith integrated office protocols and scheduling software, RS3 V4.1.6 \"Utility Helper\" with remote maintenance routine download capability and pest extermination programs,  and the RX2 V1.16.4 \"Vault Helper\", with all the necessary Vault protocols. Protectrons usually came with a special pod, for storage, maintenance, and recharging, and the Standard Protectron Control Interface v2.40 installed on terminals connected to the pod and responsible for controlling Protectrons slaved to it. The introduction of the Protectron harmfully affected the situation of workers in the United States. Although companies would deny that the introduction of robotic workers was meant to replace human workers, he reality was that any company where Protectrons or other robots were introduced would soon see mass layoffs. In one particular instance, a Pittsburgh steel mill decided to lay off all of its workers citing budget cuts and the need to shut the plant down. When the workers started an occupation strike that turned violent, the company simply allowed the new Protectron fleet to enter the facility and gun down the striking workers.",

            "constant": false,
            "content": "The Robobrain's chassis is a large, bulky cylinder with two continuous tracks providing mobility, powered by dual 40 horsepower motors, attached via a flexible or fixed mount. The torso is heavily armored, containing the internal power plant, sensors, and storage. The central processing unit, the brain, is located in a dome mounted on top of the chassis. A pair of flexible extenders emerge from the sides of the torso, with manipulators that boast opposable claws. Together with very precise servomotors and rotator mechanisms, they enable the robot to manipulate its surroundings with extreme precision, including the operation of human weapons (typically assault rifles or submachine guns) and devices designed for human hands. The chassis also contains robust monitoring systems. The dome containing the brain is filled with biomedical gel to preserve the brain, with armored glass providing plenty of protection. However, it can still be damaged, disrupting the brain/machine connection, activity within the brain, or cause depressurization and leaking of the contents, all of which are serious problems without qualified maintenance personnel. If the proper seal is maintained, the brain contained within can be expected to last for centuries. The main chassis is very sturdy, with armor plating installed to protect the hydraulics, relays, and other crucial instrumentation (such as the auto gyro sequencer, hydraulics, restrictor coils, relays etc.). The primary power supply was also contained within the shell, alongside reserve power systems that would engage in case of fluctuation in the main power supply. More advanced Robobrains were capable of self-repairing to full condition, if given enough time. The hull also contains sensors which provide the robot with high resolution imagery of their surroundings. These are quite complex and include imaging scanners, backup infrared sensors, and auto-tracking functionality. Robobrains can also lock-on targets for increased accuracy. Finally, to simplify communications with controllers, Robobrains were outfitted with audio receptors and voice modules, allowing it to receive, interpret, and mimic any normal human voice. Though the technology matured thanks to its inclusion in Mr Handy units, it still had its quirks. Properly processed Robobrains were supposed to be devoid of personality. The removal process prevented personality retention,while subsequent conditioning with CODE and installation of neural inhibitors ensured compliance and permanent removal - at least in theory. In practice, human brains proved resilient to wipes, persistently attempting to preserve a sense of self. Without regular wipes and maintenance, a Robobrain would develop an ersatz personality, typically of the violent, criminally insane variety. A minority could develop more intricate personalities, capable of higher thought processes.  However, what was a flaw in combat robotics was found useful in certain extreme life preservation experiments. While Robert House was unwilling to undergo conversion, a group of pre-War millionaires funding the construction of Vault 118 on Mount Desert Island elected to go through with the idea. Their bodies were carefully preserved, with brains installed in late model Robobrain chassis, stationed at the Vault. By programming the voice synthesizers to use their original voices, Bert Riggs, one of the Robobrain developers, attempted to allow the brains to preserve their owners' original personalities and minds. While he did succeed on the surface, the side-effects dreaded by Robert House manifested more subtly. The usual symptoms were repetitive, delusional behavior, disconnect from reality, and distortion of perception. The array of features greatly depends on the on-board software. Most onboard programs date back to the immediate pre-War era, like Sensors '76. Other software examples are Facility Maintenance v2.1, Movement v4.8b, Repair v0.8a, Pest Control v1.4, and Hearts v1.0 (installed on Robobrains deployed in the Mariposa Military Base). Reliability and longevity were key concerns for programmers: For increased performance and reliability, the main robotic OS would reroute functions from damaged subsystems. To organize and coordinate robots in a facility, General Atomics International typically set up a wireless local area network matrix, where robots are slaved to a master computer intelligence monitoring their activities and adjusting parameters in response to human commands or changing circumstances. Combat was handled by a separate set of routines. When a Robobrain enters combat mode, it engages a full suite of combat software focused on terminating hostiles. The Robobrain continuously calculates combat odds and battle events, including computing threat levels, scanning enemy capabilities, determining optimal attack ranges, and accounting for other critical elements of combat. In general, while the Robobrain relies on pre-loaded attack patterns (like pattern Omega) and sequences in combat, it will adjust its tactics, recalibrate targeting sensors and scanners on the go, and correct firing data. In situations where battle analysis determines that the engagement cannot be won, the Robobrain will engage its self preservation programming and attempt to break contact and evacuate. Retreating destinations typically specified factories or military assembly points. The Robobrain is fully capable of using weapons designed for humans, provided they are large enough. Typically, Robobrains would be provided with military-grade assault rifles, like the AK-112 or sharpshooter weapons, like the DKS-501, benefiting greatly from the computerized accuracy of a Robobrain. Certain models were also outfitted with built-in laser weapons, integrated in the manipulators. Their firepower was comparable to an AEP7 laser pistol. Finally, Robobrains were also equipped with an integrated Mesmetron for subjugating enemy combatants and aiding in the process of interrogating prisoners (though the technology was experimental, due to the risk for spontaneous cranial eruption).",

            "content": "A dedicated combat variant of their civilian Mister Handy, the Mister Gutsy series was developed by General Atomics International. t was commissioned by the United States Army shortly before the atomic apocalypse of 2077, with the first units seeing service in the liberation of Anchorage in January, at least according to the Anchorage Reclamation simulation. The Mr. Gutsy is a personal protection automaton and comes equipped with heavier armor than most utility robots. It also carries a plasma weapon to be used in defense. The shell was rebuilt with lightweight armor plating, while the usual array of tools was upgraded with a plasma caster on a flexible mount. The key advantage of Mister Gutsies that separates it from other combat robots is its sheer maneuverability and spatial awareness. The Mister Gutsy is also upgraded with dedicated military software, including the ability to refuse orders issued by commanders who are incompetent or under court martial, remote link-up capability for updating orders in real time, and a brand-new Sergeant Major v.1.0 simulated personality that channeled the stereotypical Marine drill instructor and doubled as a vessel for state propaganda. However, in its rush to present the Army with a working model, General Atomics cut corners and the resulting personality had issues stemming from vague definitions used in programming its neural network. The most notable of these was the fact that in the absence of orders, units defaulted to a patrol mode and attacked all unauthorized personnel with extreme violence, as per combat protocol Charlie Zulu 4. The military accepted these flaws, pressing them into service. They first bore MGZ-##### serials, before transitioning to the standard ABC-##### nomenclature. To distinguish between different variants of the robot, ranks were used: The baseline version was named Mister, with subsequent variants designated Sergeant, Lieutenant, Major and Colonel. A specialized field medic model was derived from the basic Mister Gutsy, with all combat functionality disabled and an encyclopedic knowledge of medical procedures, particularly surgery.",

            "comment": "Mister Handy",
            "constant": false,
            "content": "Mister Handy (stylized as Mr. Handy) is a multipurpose robot developed by General Atomics International before the Great War and refined in collaboration with RobCo Industries. It was an incredibly popular model, used by government agencies, private companies, and individual citizens across the United States. The first Mister Handy was introduced to the robotics market in 2037 by General Atomics International, as a general-purpose construction and maintenance unit. Used widely on both the American and Mexican markets (especially after the Mexico City earthquake of 2042), it was a rugged, reliable design. So reliable that it only received one major hardware update in 2039, to eliminate a bug causing interference in the operation of the multiple arms. The Calpower 238B nuclear power unit and self-maintenance modes were key to its success, ensuring each robot's longevity. To minimize maintenance overhead, each Mr. Handy was designed to perform its nuclear fuel replacement and radiation cleansing. Each unit could carry out maintenance and repairs on other units (it could not carry it out on itself). However, as rugged and reliable as the original Mr. Handy was, it was still a design rooted in the technology of the 2030s, with a compact computer brain that was incapable of learning or executing complex tasks without extensive programming. By the 2070s, it was an automaton surrounded by more advanced designs utilizing cutting edge neural networks. In order to maintain their market share, General Atomics entered into a joint venture with RobCo Industries, combining its talent with General Atomics' experience in robotics. The resulting model was a sleek, elegant design capable of self-programming and initiative, more than making up for halving the number of arms to just three. Despite its sophistication, it was also cost-effective, making it the perfect domestic servant robot. The success of this model resulted in the development of several additional models, including dedicated medical and military versions.  Sometime before the Great War, General Atomics International and RobCo wanted to upgrade their Mister Handy line by adding an additional hand alongside additional features. The voice of the Mister Handy came from English actor Sebastian Leslie, who was famous for playing a butler character named Bartholomew Codsworth. At some point before January 2077, he sold his vocal rights to RobCo for a mere 186,000 USD. The original General Atomics International Mr. Handy has a distinct, lumbering appearance with easily identifiable sub-assemblies. The barrel-like main body contains the Calpower 238B nuclear power unit (200 KW output with two year endurance; comparable to a truck engine) and eight rechargeable energy cells with a 270,000 KWS output, together with an integral mechanic toolset and the computer brain. The fully rotating head mounted on top houses the single eye and sensors, together with a spotlight and basic communicator with a cheap voice synthesizer, short range radio, and communications jack. The two pods mounted on the sides of the main body each contain a 200 KW vectored-thrust ducted fan with ground-effect (GEV) skirts that allow the Mr. Handy to hover in the air. Finally, each of the six arms mounted below the main body is strong enough to lift heavy loads, while retaining superior flexibility and coordination that allows the Mr. Handy to use all of them in any configuration with a negligible loss of performance. Each is actuated by motors contained within and contains nimble manipulators capable of tasks ranging from walking the dog to operating heavy weapons such as miniguns, flamers, and plasma casters. he entire robot weighs 907.8 pounds (~450 kg), giving it an excellent power to weight ratio. Although the robot's performance was hampered by its simple, computer brain, a large number of units remained in service as late as 2077, 40 years after it entered the market. Although vulnerable to logic circuit failures, particularly in hazardous environments or without maintenance, it was used in both corporate and military settings, including locations like the demonstration Vault, Mariposa Military Base, and Poseidon Oil Reactor № 5. Even the Enclave used a number of Mr. Handy units in conjunction with their Vertibird teams, usually for cargo hauling. It's a testament to GAI's design that one unit survived a crash-landing near Klamath Falls relatively intact. Separated by only a few models from the original General Atomics Mr Handy, the next-generation robot is a radical departure from that of its ancestor, created from the ground up as a domestic servant, rather than heavy-duty construction robot (although its modularity allows it to be fitted with power tools and used in the original role with ease). It is an extremely compact design: The spherical main body houses not just the nuclear power unit, but also the single centrally-mounted jet thruster with a ground-effect skirt allowing it to hover, and a highly sophisticated neural network mimicking the functionality of a human brain. The compact brain of the Mr. Handy is easily one of its most stunning features, theoretically capable of achieving sentience, becoming a true artificial intelligence. Special limiters are included in neural pathways responsible for learning to prevent such an occurrence. Behavior limiters act as a failsafe in case the aforementioned limiters are disabled in a Mister Handy or one of its derivatives. This can occur as a result of degradation of neural pathways or electrical damage. Depending on the severity of the damage, it can be resolved by rerouting functions and closing specific pathways. In cases where a Mr Handy does achieve sentience thanks to the removal of governors on learning abilities, but the behavior limiters remain in effect, the affected unit effectively becomes a slave: Incapable of independent action and forced to behave in accordance with the restrictions imposed on it. In such a case, the robot can use its supercharged learning abilities to devise methods to circumvent its programming and disable the behavior limiters to gain freedom, such as by exploiting loopholes in behavioral restrictions. Its sub-assemblies include three arms and three eyes. The former are segmented and highly flexible. Their modular design allows them to accept a variety of manipulators, from a simple pincer, through a titanium saw and laser cutter, to military-grade weapons such as a plasma blaster or a flamethrower. Their only limitation is the fact that they cannot lift objects heavier than 18 kg (40 lbs). Eyes are mounted on flexible eye stalks, giving it excellent spatial awareness and a nearly 360 degree field of view. They are completed by a sophisticated sensor package, including navigational, chemical (including olfactory or scent detectors), and nuclear sensors. Other features of the robot line include the ability to perform self-diagnostic and self-maintenance, allowing a single unit to function for an extended period of time (even two centuries in some cases), and a water condensator for preparing canisters of purified water. The new model was marketed as a domestic servant first and foremost, capable of handling almost every task in the household, from accounting and cooking to pet care and entertainment (although GAI discouraged using its hover jet as a barbeque fire). However, its sophisticated neural network and agile, light design made it an excellent choice for a variety of private and military entities. The basic Mister Handy was also employed as a security robot,  with specialized variants available. These included medical models like the Miss Nanny and Mister Orderly, as well as the combat version, Mister Gutsy.",

            "constant": false,
            "content": "The Ash Heap is one of the seven regions of Appalachia. The Mount Blair region was the location of a large-scale coal mining operation before the Great War. Two different families, the Garrahans and Hornwrights, established businesses here, subsequently overlooking the mining operations from Bramwell. As part of this industry, large machines such as the Rockhound were used to remove large parts of the mountain at once. This mining operation caused the air quality of surrounding cities such as Lewisburg to deteriorate, prompting leadership to release public service announcements instructing citizens to wear gas masks during inclement weather.  Clear Skies Alliance and Hornwright Industrial were developing air purifiers to cleanse the air around Mount Blair. After the Great War, survivors began to refer to this region as the \"Ash Heap\" due to its harsh environment. A thick layer of filthy smoke and cinders that blankets the area constantly bellow up from the mines, containing several toxins, which results in individuals inhabiting or traveling through necessitating protective breathing equipment. Survivors believe this is caused by fires in the tunnels below, raging unceasingly for some unknown reason. Despite this, the mines underneath the region still hold riches. Around 2103, the Blue Ridge Caravan Company established an outpost at the western exit of the Big Bend Tunnel, using the tunnel to cross underneath the Savage Divide to the Cranberry Bog. The Blood Eagles have a strong presence in the Ash Heap, having settled into and repurposed many old campsites across the region, such as the Rollins labor camp or the Sludge Works. The environment of the Ash Heap is dangerous compared to other regions of Appalachia. Toxic air might suffocate the player and for this reason is advised to equip a gas mask or similar to null the effects. Failure to do so could lead to becoming infected with Sludge Lung from the poisoned air.\n\nWeather occurring in the Ash Heap is primarily overcast, caused by the polluted smog covering the area. The weather has a 40% chance to be overcast, 40% to be misty, 11% to be an ash storm, 7% to be rainy, and 2% to be a radstorm. Ash storms are a type of weather unique to the region, primarily occurring near Mount Blair. Vegetation is less common in the environment of the Ash Heap, but includes unique flora such as the ash rose as well as blight caps, firecracker berries, silt bean plants, and starlight berries. All lakes and ponds in the region have toxic water, with only two having dirty water instead; Lake Reynolds and the small lake in the Sludge Works. The Ash Heap is located in the southwest corner of the map, bordered by the Forest to the north and the Savage Divide to the east. The Rockhound sits atop Mount Blair, at the western-central area, northeast of the township of Welch, and is mostly surrounded by the railroad system. The other two towns, Beckley and Lewisburg, are to the west and east of the mountain respectively. Three main state routes cross through the Ash Heap, including Route 81 running parallel with the Ohio River to the west, and Routes 83 and 84 traversing the center.\n\nThe Blue Ridge Caravan Company has an outpost at the Big Bend Tunnel East on the eastern reaches of the region. The Blood Eagles have repurposed many old campsites across the region, and can be easily found between Welch and Lewisburg.",

            "constant": false,
            "content": "The Cranberry Bog is one of the seven regions of Appalachia. Cranberry Bog refers to the area in the southeastern part of Appalachia, roughly bounded by the Appalachians in the west and the Shenandoah/Potomac watershed to the north. Officially named as such by pre-War authorities, it took its name from the colorful red floras in this corner of West Virginia, including cranberry, pitcher, and sundew plants.  Watoga was founded in the heart of the Bog, to act as the city of the future in 2042, with intensive clear-cutting and drainage operations continuing for the next nearly four decades. The ecological catastrophe and the expansion of Watoga did not begin in full until the 2070s when the project was transformed into as a joint effort between the United States government, RobCo and Atomic Mining Services to build a \"city of the future.\" All public services in Watoga were designed to be completely automated, including a full staff of custodial and security robots. Apart from the destruction of the natural environment, Watoga also had a deleterious impact on the existing residents of the Bog. Unable to afford living space in Watoga itself, they were either displaced by the ever-expanding city full of affluent elitists or forced out by AMS goons. It followed a pattern of general misery established by Allegheny Asylum, which gained notoriety following the Charleston Herald's revelation of routine patient mistreatment at the facility and was shuttered in 2061. The Atomic Mining Services corporation also used the region as its own personal sandbox, experimenting with subterranean nuclear detonations to generate ultracite and shifting the cleanup cost and fallout to the hapless residents and companies. The Great War affected the region badly. Watoga, an autonomous city and a natural hub for reconstruction, was hit by a destructive computer virus shortly before the Great War, forcing the population into a desperate flight into the countryside. The nuclear war prevented any proper response from the authorities, with the refugees scattering into the surrounding regions, many of them holing up at the closed-down asylum. Other survivors of Appalachia avoided the Cranberry Bog more than any other region, and only the most well-equipped dared to travel here, aided by stories of the asylum. The isolation of the region made it the perfect candidate for Thomas Eckhart's secretive experiments. It was here that he had the scorchbeasts locked away below ground to act as his failsafe and here that he unleashed them upon Appalachia in 2085. While the Enclave was wiped out by internal conflict, the Bog had yet a role to play. By 2085, the Appalachian Brotherhood of Steel was already well established at the asylum, inheriting it from the previous residents. Fort Defiance, as it was called, became the nucleus of their expansion and operations. When the Scorched threat became apparent, it also became the center of their defensive network on the edge of the Bog. Although the Brotherhood failed in their efforts in 2095, following the loss of Paladin Taggerdy and nearly all standing personnel, their automated SAM stations continued the fight, buying Appalachia time until Vault 76 Vault Dweller emerged on Reclamation Day and confronted the scorchbeasts on their own turf - saving humanity from extinction. The colorful red flora of Cranberry Bog was originally West Virginia's naturally occurring cranberry, pitcher, and sundew plants. The Cranberry Bog is in the southeastern portion of Appalachia. The survivors of Appalachia avoid the Cranberry Bog due to the sheer number of dangerous creatures and locations. Visitors to the area avoid the Allegheny Asylum in particular, due to disturbing tales about the former hospital, which was originally built in the mid-1800s as a treatment facility for the mentally ill. Farther into the Bog, Watoga was built as a joint effort between the United States government, RobCo and Atomic Mining Services to build a \"city of the future.\" All public services in Watoga were designed to be completely automated, including a full staff of security robots. Sometime after the bombs dropped the area was claimed by the Appalachian Brotherhood of Steel. There are several abandoned Brotherhood of Steel outposts and ASAM sites littered throughout the region that were used in operations against the Scorched. Due to the prime fissure being located here, as well as being the birthplace of ultracite, there are a large number of Scorched and scorchbeasts in the region.",

            "content": "The Mire is one of the seven regions of Appalachia. The Mire was once a remote, rural region of Appalachia east of the Savage Divide, home to the Free States movement sparked by Raleigh Clay. Suspicious of the government's vault program and aware of the escalation of the Resource Wars, the group built private concrete bunkers scattered throughout the region, using the nearby Harpers Ferry as a staging area and supply point. The movement's conspiracy theories and ideals unnerved patriotic visitors and disrupted the small town's tourism. Violence between the Free States and law enforcement drew the attention of the government. In June 2077, the public prosecutor pressed charges against the movement's founder, and, by November, the Free States openly seceded from the United States and retreated to their concrete bunkers. After the Great War, the Mire's forest and swamp environment began to mutate and grow deadly with each passing day. Exactly one year after the Great War, Vault 94 opened its vault door and sent ambassadors into the wasteland to invite survivors back to the vault. In November 2078, an ambassador reached the town of Harpers Ferry. After hearing about the Vault, Mayor Miranda Vox sent a group of survivors led by Cole to investigate the ambassador's claims. Certain that the dwellers' hospitality was a trap, the group massacred the vault's leaders and attacked the vault's G.E.C.K. unit, triggering a massive nuclear explosion. A thick fog poured from the vault's entrance, rapidly intensifying the area's swampy environment and mutating the region's thick foliage. The Savage Divide acted as a natural barrier, preventing the Mire's expansion to the west. In 2079, Raleigh Clay gave the all-clear signal to Free States members and was contacted by Miranda Vox, with Harpers Ferry being in desperate need of assistance. Despite previous conflicts, the movement agreed to provide aid. Later in the year, a group of Free States members secured the Thunder Mountain Power Plant, but were assaulted by Taggerdy's Thunder and chose to surrender the complex to them. By 2081, the Brotherhood of Steel used the pre-War Camp Venture location to provide survival training to members of the Free States. After intensifying requisitions from local survivors, the Brotherhood abandoned the camp in 2094 to defend Fort Defiance and the Thunder Mountain Power Plant. In August 2095, the Brotherhood finally fell as Thunder Mountain was overrun with Scorched. Using sonic generator technology salvaged from Brotherhood outposts, the Free States set up lures in the region to attract, trap, and kill scorchbeasts. At some point in the pre-Plague period, the Enclave established a field lab at Tanagra Town, a neighborhood which had been lifted above the canopy by a towering pillar of strangler plants. Their research was ultimately destroyed, but strangler plant seed pods were returned to Enclave Research Facility Site J for study.\n\nIn 2096, Harpers Ferry was attacked by Scorched and the Free States retreated back into their bunkers throughout the Mire, banning all efforts to recover or save what remained of the town or its inhabitants. In 2102, the residents of Vault 76 began exploring the Mire. It was known as a place to hunt cryptids. Late in the year, they gained access to the Enclave field lab at Tanagra.\n\nIn 2103, a group of villagers settled the abandoned Treehouse Village under the leadership of Jennie Brown, renaming it the Retreat. The raider Dagger and her goons made their headquarters in a nearby cave, and began demanding tribute from the village on the threat of death. In the south, the Followers of the Winged One cult constructed a towering primitivist stronghold called Moth-Home. At a nearby camp dubbed Blake's Offering, cultists live among unusual strangler vine formations. Additionally, crashed astronaut Sofia Daguerre was found in a bunker by the Vault Dwellers.\n\nIn 2104, the Sunday Brothers' cabin was settled by moonshiners. The Mire is a dark, swampy region home to twisting vines, large tree canopies, and tall grass. The thick foliage gives cover to the region's mutated creatures and makes the area one of the darkest at night. While radiation from the Great War attributed to mutations, the region's red-hued environment is largely due to the explosion of Vault 94's G.E.C.K. The strangler vines infest the entire region, especially along the river. Strangler hearts bloom from these vines, which are capable of infesting creatures and controlling them. These coarse red vines grow rapidly, and tend to rip buildings apart and lift vehicles off the ground.\n\nThe Mire's weather is primarily misty, though the region may occasionally suffer from highly-radioactive radstorms. The weather has a 55% chance to be misty, 15% to be misty and rainy, 15% to be foggy, 15% to be clear, and 3% to be a radstorm.",

            "content": "The Savage Divide is one of the seven regions of Appalachia. Before the Great War, these high mountains of Appalachia were home to ski resorts, bed-and-breakfasts, and cabins available for rent by tourists. Among the most popular was Top of the World, originally an enormous ski lift station, complete with shops and restaurants at its peak.\n\nFarther north and nestled in the mountains is a spiritual retreat center known as the Palace of the Winding Path. Its unique architecture stands in stark contrast to the rest of Appalachia's mountains. Trading rumors of the goings-on inside those fenced-in walls was a popular pre-War pastime.\n\nAfter the war, the Monongahela National Forest now became known to survivors as the Savage Divide. The mountainous area became a patchwork landscape of abandoned resorts and scenic retreats, home to mole miners and super mutants. It became the base of operations for Appalachia's raider factions after the brutal winter of 2077/2078 reduced the affluent tourists and guests to cutthroats and cannibals, doing whatever necessary to survive. The raider-filled region also greatly prevented the Responders, primarily based on the west side, from working cohesively alongside the Free States and the Brotherhood of Steel on the east side. For example, when contact with the Free States was lost after Harpers Ferry was overrun in 2086, the Responders could only send members through the region to re-establish contact. Members of these factions who crossed the Savage Divide were often killed by raiders who took their supplies, fueling the danger of the region. The name given to the region comes from the tall mountains creating a large wall between the regions of the Forest, Ash Heap and Toxic Valley on the west side, and the regions of the Mire and Cranberry Bog on the east side. The Savage Divide extends all the way from the north to the south of the Appalachia map. It divides both the Mire (to the northeast) and the Cranberry Bog (to the southeast) from the Toxic Valley (to the northwest), the Forest (to the west), and the Ash Heap (to the southwest). Most of its train stations are occupied by raider vendorbots.",

After the Great War, the combined pollution and nuclear fallout filled the white wastes of the Toxic Valley with all manner of horrifying beasts, prowling the stretches of devastated waste in search of the few hardy plants that survived the blight or prey to consume.

            "content": "An isolated town located on the California/Nevada border, Hopeville and its bigger brother, Ashton, were established in the late 21st century in the remote badlands to act both as an example of the American dream in practice and its guardians. Beneath white picket fences, family cookouts and children happily frolicking in the streets lay an extensive network of nuclear missile silos built under the auspices of the Commonwealth Defense Administration Ballistic Defense Division. Although omnipresent jingoistic propaganda declared this a solid ground for the American dream, it was anything but. The complex was established in a geologically unstable region, where minor earthquakes were quite common. Military authorities downplayed these problems, confident in the safety of American engineering. Another problem was caused by the fact that the US Army used Hopeville as proving grounds for Big MT's weather control research, using the denizens of the region as guinea pigs. Although Hopeville was a planned community with carefully selected citizens, such a system was not foolproof. By 2077, the region had a large community of dissidents, including local hippies, who protested the ongoing Sino-American War or the ravages of the military-industrial complex at military construction camps across both Hopeville and Ashton. In an example of the \"white-hot rage of capitalist justice,\" the Political Office arranged to have them rounded up and sent to Big MT as test subjects for the company's latest projects, aided by soldiers under the command of General Wellesley, the military liaison to Big MT. Although considered a vital part of America's ballistic shield, it appears that building the missile complex near fault lines turned out to be a bad idea. During the Great War, most of the nuclear missiles stored in these missile silos were never launched, remaining safely in their berths for the next two centuries. Although Hopeville and Ashton were abandoned in the wake of the nuclear devastation, a small community would cling to life within the storm-covered lands on the edges of California and Nevada. Braving the harsh weather unleashed on it constantly from Big MT, those who inhabited the ruins of the Old World in Hopeville and Ashton stubbornly clung to life, drawing strength or inspiration from the ancient symbols and technology that surrounded them. By the 23rd century, the settlement flourished thanks to a single courier who was willing to brave the seasons and storms to deliver packages to the community. Whatever the reason, that lone courier trekked the hard road repeatedly, giving them hope and a connection to civilization. This community eventually styled itself as the Divide, taking name not from the monstrous gash in the earth that would eventually appear there, but its role both as a divide and bridge between the east and west, the New California Republic and the Mojave Wasteland. The community had a chance to become something akin to a second Shady Sands, founding something better than either the NCR or the Legion. The nation that would stir to life here had a chance of bridging the gap between the East and the West, between Caesar's tribes and the great houses of the NCR. Something greater than either, that could unify the two flags into a single banner. Before that could happen, however, the New California Republic moved in, following the trail blazed by the courier. The Divide would become a major secondary route into the Mojave, reducing the traffic on the Long 15 to the core lands of the NCR. Both the army and the merchant houses of the NCR benefited from the new route established through this storm-wracked region. Naturally, two lifelines leading into the Mojave were a serious problem for Caesar's strategy, as it gave the NCR a tremendous logistical advantage despite the intense campaign of sabotage in the period leading up to the First Battle of Hoover Dam. In the months leading up to the battle, Caesar dispatched a group of frumentarii and assassins to cut the supply line and deny the road to the NCR, building on the destruction of New Canaan and raids on caravans out west. However, it was the same courier that established the land trail to the Divide, who would play the pivotal role. As both legionaries and NCR troops executed the plans of their masters, the courier came with a delivery of a single package from the faraway Navarro, recovered by the NCR and sent to the Divide. The NCR believed the people who lived among the silos, surrounded by Old World symbols like those on the package, could help them make sense of the item recovered in the Enclave's former base. What they didn't realize was that the package would seal the Divide's doom.\n\nAfter being delivered, the Dividers opened it up and the device suddenly activated, linking with the launch computers hidden in the dormant silos by \"talking\" to them in sending launch codes and security overrides. Warheads started exploding beneath the ground, triggering a massive earthquake that ripped the land open, twisting Ashton, Hopeville and the military facilities above and beneath. It became an expanse of cracked, blighted landscape, while the sand and ash from the devastation was caught and kicked up into the skies above by the artificial storms, turning an already savage weather into one, monstrous dust storm that could skin a man alive. In fact, it did flay people alive, but not all died. Those who weren't killed by the nuclear detonations or debris let loose by the earthquake were twisted by the radioactive storms, constantly flayed alive and turned into terrifying mutants; dead men walking sustained only by the radiation without and the hate within. Regardless of their previous affiliation, these creatures, now known as the \"Marked Men,\" banded together into packs, repairing their armor and weapons with whatever this new \"Divide\" provided. There was only one survivor, saved from death or marking by the medical robots of the Divide, which mistook the Stars and Stripes on his back for a U.S. military uniform. He walked out of the Divide, whole on the outside, but broken within. Despite the loss of the Legion task force, the destruction of the Divide was a strategic victory for the Legion. With the land around Hopeville and Ashton destroyed and the sandstorm wreaking havoc on all who tried to pass through, the NCR lost its secondary supply route and couldn't take California State Route 127 north to get around the mountains anymore. Companies sent through were torn apart before they even reached the lands of Nevada, with Ranger scouts later confirming that the route was impassable. Without it, NCR could not march reinforcements into Nevada fast enough to capitalize on their victory at the First Battle of Hoover Dam, giving Caesar time to retreat to Arizona and prepare his Legion for another confrontation. The story of the Divide continued, however. The memory of the settlement has vanished from common consciousness, scrubbed by the violent storms that rendered it impossible to brave for all but the hardiest of travelers. One person remembered, though. A former Legion frumentarius, Ulysses walked the wastes for four more years, reflecting on the destruction brought upon the fledgling nation by a single courier. Disillusioned with the Legion and the NCR alike, Ulysses decided to make history repeat itself. Unlike the Courier, however, he would do so with open eyes. He gathered knowledge and slowly mastered the Divide's many secrets, bringing the nuclear silos back to life as best he could.\n\nThen fortune smiled upon him. The arrival of ED-E in the Mojave Wasteland sped the process up greatly, as the Divide's machines remotely scanned the eyebot and manufactured a new series of robots that accelerated the restoration of the silos. In the process, fragments of the nuclear detonator that the Courier delivered were scavenged and used to manufacture a unique maintenance eyebot at the Hopeville missile silo, though it remained in stasis. Recognizing this as an auspicious moment, Ulysses sent a single message to the Courier who just cheated death at Goodsprings, inviting them to walk the lonesome road through the Divide and unknowingly bring the eyebot to him. Then he waited, preparing the nuclear missiles to wipe the slate clean once more, but not before he had a chance for reckoning with the Courier, to have an \"ending to things\" beneath the storms of the Divide and the Old World flag. The Divide is a region located northwest of the Mojave Wasteland, approximately near the Nevada/California border, with Big MT situated to the south. It was once the home of Hopeville, a planned community built around and over a ballistic missile silo complex, and Ashton, a large city that doubled as a major highway junction. However, whatever the Divide was is largely irrelevant, as the nuclear disaster that befell the region at the Courier's hands has turned it into an unrecognizable mess of twisted metal, concrete and dirt, slowly weathered by the massive sandstorm blanketing the entire region.\n\nThe nuclear missiles concealed within Ashton's silos were launched by the automatic detonator delivered by the Courier, exploding beneath the ground. The explosions, combined with the presence of the Pahrump Valley fault line, created a massive canyon stretching east to west, filled with collapsed buildings, vehicles and infrastructure from Ashton. The highway network was warped and twisted by the combination of factors, with entire fragments of the elevated superhighway breaking off and crushing buildings below.\n\nHopeville and adjacent southern military facilities escaped much of the devastation, as missile silos were outside the range of the detonator's transmitter. However, they were subjected to the terrifying earthquakes and subsequent storms, with at least one missile bunker listing nearly fifteen degrees due to the shifting foundations. Structural reinforcement and armor ensured the survival of these installations, complete with power infrastructure.",

When the Courier's delivery of the Navarro package caused underground nuclear warheads to detonate and cause massive devastation, it created a veil of perpetual storms that kick up winds so strong the flesh was torn from their bodies, exposing the raw muscle, while the intense radiation caused them to undergo a type of ghoulification. Unable to die to radiation, it instead kept them alive, trapped in a state of constant, excruciating pain from the winds flaying them of their skin. Rumors of the marked men and the hellish place they call home spread throughout the West Coast similar to the legends of the Sierra Madre, the Burned Man, and the Big Empty. Driven mad by the pain they experienced, the marked men lashed out at anyone other than themselves, having found a common enemy in the Divide. Though they sometimes attacked and killed one another, apparently for sport, their shared pain had overpowered any animosity between the NCR and the Legion. They were known to make camps near silos and warheads to take advantage of the healing effects of radiation. Those of the marked men who once followed Caesar have cobbled together several different, crude versions of Legate Lanius' helmet, thought to be an attempt to anchor their identities and remember some of their past. The former NCR soldiers, on the other hand, stuck to their guns and explosives; even as ghouls, they cannot forget the lessons instilled in them by their army training. Whatever remains of the armor they wore on the day they were turned, over time, the marked men have tried to patch it together with pieces of the Divide like road signs, license plates and other scrap metal. A marked man is identified as a unique subtype of ghoul with a fiery red tone due to their brutal environment; ghoulification made their flesh weak and fragile, but it was the storms that stripped their skin off, leaving behind only the raw muscle underneath. It's speculated that the radiation of the Divide may be the only thing keeping them alive. They congregate in squads and small camps of around four marked men, often led by particularly strong cases who have taken on a new name to exemplify their strength.",

Many travelers and prospectors alike in the Mojave have sought out the legendary city after claiming to have heard a woman's voice on a pre-War radio broadcast, never to be heard from again. Only one man truly \"found\" it and lived. The Courier is lured to the Sierra Madre by that same broadcast advertising the gala grand opening. The city and the resort and casino were designed and built by one man, Frederick Sinclair, his last venture a few years before the Great War. The Sierra Madre, especially the casino, was intended as a place for guests to reverse their fortunes and \"begin again.\" During its construction until the end, it remained a reclusive area. All conveniences were supplied to the inhabitants by unique vending machines, which provided a number of commercial and non-commercial services, and allowed the residents to live in self-sufficiency, even when cut off from the outside world. The goal of the entire enterprise was not only to create a great casino - it was to create the perfect shelter from the nuclear holocaust. Every element of Sierra Madre's functions is designed to protect its inhabitants.\n\nIn design, Sinclair was drawn to the nostalgic Art Deco era. This is reflected in the architecture of the villa and of the casino. To make it a perfect opening gala, Sinclair strengthened its frequency emissions, normally reserved for emergency broadcast signals before the war. The kitchens of the Sierra Madre aimed for a 5-star rating, and sought to bring in the best chefs from around the world. In order to meet deadlines and budgets, the construction of the Sierra Madre was handled by two different companies: a well-performing company for the casino, and a cheaper, slacking, corrupt company for the Villa, resulting in numerous incidents during the construction of the Villa.\n\nAs guardian of his paradise, Sinclair forbade any other food or vending machines beyond the ones he'd installed there, and banned any personal contraband like chems, alcohol, and \"foreign substances\", which created a black market from the workers within. Part of Sierra Madre's security's role was to prevent such contraband from entering the Villa area. They were known to have conducted inspections of the Puesta del Sol construction offices, confiscating prohibited items.\n\nObsessed with security, likely due to his own financial losses in the 2070s, Sinclair installed holograms, a futuristic technology purchased on an exclusive contract by Sinclair. The doors of the Sierra Madre were designed to hermetically seal in case of emergency, and the speakers were shielded to prevent vandalism. The Sierra Madre Casino & Resort was equipped with an automated front desk that would escort guests to their rooms upon arrival, and security systems that would stun those entering with foreign substances or contaminated by radiation.\n\nThere is also a darker side to the Madre. In return for the technologies supplied by Big MT, Sinclair agreed to have the casino and the villa act as proving grounds for various experimental technologies such as the saturnite alloy, hazmat suits, and prototype matter recombinators. Sinclair was oblivious to the fact that previous similar deals did not end well (as was the case with Hopeville and its disastrous meteorological research project). In the Sierra Madre, the catch came in the form of the Cloud, a strange airborne toxin created in the laboratories of Big MT. The Sierra Madre Villa was the private city of the guests, employees, and workers of Frederick Sinclair, situated just before the casino. The streets were built so that cars can not circulate, preventing pollution and noise nuisance.\n\nIn addition to the main area, the Villa was composed of four districts:\n\nMedical District, containing the Villa clinic.\nPuesta del Sol, which witnessed numerous clashes and arguments involving the casino construction crews; construction lagged behind Salida del Sol. Construction efforts seemed to have exhausted momentum and money.\nResidential District, for the casino's high rollers and entertainers.\nSalida del Sol, the home of the church and many of the casino staff.\nTo avoid having to spend too much money for the construction of the villa at the expense of the casino, it was poorly constructed. The material used for the Villa's construction was described as \"sand barely held together with spit and glue.\" Buildings and structures in the Villa were completely unstable and could collapse overnight. All of this caused construction crews to suffer numerous setbacks and accidents. To prevent the employees of the Sierra Madre from discovering these facts, senior persons destroyed all medical reports, and were also protected legally. In addition, shipping problems plagued the Villa. Construction explosives, countless crates of steak knives, and more were shipped to the Villa, paid for, and left. The Sierra Madre Casino is more than a mere casino & resort – it is the material testament to one man's inability to let go. Seeing the Great War nearing, Frederick Sinclair, the chief architect and financier of this grand fortress, wished to save Vera Keyes, his love, from the looming destruction. To this end, the Sierra Madre Villa and its capstone casino were built. But that was not enough for Sinclair: deep within the basement of the casino, a nearly impenetrable vault was constructed as well, to make sure he and his love could ride out the apocalypse, together. Accordingly, security was of the utmost importance and National Electric was contracted to provide it. Anything foreign or unauthorized that entered the casino was detected by security measures and instantly rendered comatose and moved to another location within the hotel. Further into the casino, an emergency broadcast emitter could be triggered and the myriad of holograms designed specifically for Sinclair would activate, patrol the casino and executive suites, and exercise lethal force on unauthorized visitors to protect the hotel guests under their charge. The entire casino was also lined with a metal that interferes with radio reception and broadcasts out of the casino;  this was put in place to ensure that the radio frequencies from within the casino would not interfere with the hologram beacon in the Villa, which would send out an emergency signal so others would be alerted to Ms. Keyes' presence within the casino. After all this preparation, Sinclair failed to anticipate one thing: Vera's complicity with lounge singer Dean Domino's plot to break Sinclair's heart and steal the treasure of the Sierra Madre for themselves. Domino had enlisted her aid in his planned heist, later blackmailing her with evidence of her Med-X addiction, completely unaware that she was terminally ill. This news broke Sinclair's heart and he became embittered and vengeful, transforming his shelter into a trap, ensuring the elevator down to the vault only went in one direction, and upgrading his security holograms to make sure that rescue would never come for Vera and Domino. After Vera broke down and confessed everything, Sinclair, fearing he had overstepped himself, did what he could to reverse his changes, but he could only do so much and the casino remained a deathtrap. He died in the vault, unable to return to the casino and his love. The guests would meet a similar fate, while the Great War occurred outside, they were slaughtered by the automated security, their last calls for help recorded by the systems. Vera Keyes instead met her fate in her hotel room. Her last words to Sinclair were recorded by the system, her holographic form and last words living on as ghosts in the executive suites. She chose to take her own life using the drugs that kept her alive, after writing her final words \"Let Go.\"\n\nWhen the second crew arrived in 2281, the casino awoke yet again, its automated security shutting down as its other automatons started back up. Its pre-recorded music and audio files began to play, albeit on now deteriorated equipment. This proved inconvenient, as these unwilling heist members were still wearing their explosive collars, which interfered with their signal to Elijah. Meanwhile, the ghost people gathered at the casino, attempting to get in. After the Courier was able to establish a connection to one of the other floors and access a piece of the music archives (due to their importance, being a workaround to the sound files that were used in the security systems) they find a way in, with more gathering as subsequent floors were reconnected.",

            "content": "Created as an experiment by the executives of Big MT, the Cloud is a product of research conducted at the Z-43 innovative toxins plant. When the Madre owner, Frederick Sinclair came to Big MT for technology to add to his resort, he unwittingly signed a Faustian pact: along with holograms and matter recombinators, the Big MT scientists also conducted tests of the Cloud's lethality at the Sierra Madre, using the casino, villa and its inhabitants as guinea pigs in its experiments.  Sinclair likely saw no other way to get the technology he needed, as he was already teetering on the brink of bankruptcy when he started negotiating with the executives. Of course, he was not informed that he would be receiving more than just harmless prototypes. The Sierra Madre was the only testing ground that was protected by the Cloud, which was hardly a prize. The Cloud manifested itself for the first time when the cheap villa ventilation system ground to a halt, a victim of cutting corners and Mr. Yesterday's dubious practices. The pipes backed up, spewing out the red cloud. Workers in the area started choking and vomiting. Hospitalized in the villa clinic, the damage to their health was extensive enough to put them out of commission for good. To deal with the problem, Sinclair negotiated with the Big MT executives for yet another technology: The Darklight hazmat suits. Although considered creepy by the maintenance crews, they allowed the crews to explore the ventilation system and try, in vain, to identify the source of the Cloud. The teams managed to find the source of the problem in the main ventilation pipe. However, traces of the dust cloud were present and eroded the metal of the suit's locks, exposing them to the Cloud and sealing them within.  The crewmen retreated and headed to the villa clinic to get medical attention. Much to the displeasure of the attending physicians, they cut themselves out of the suits with steak knives. However, despite the problems, the ventilation system was eventually restored to barely functional order. When the Great War hit shortly afterward, it continued to work for a few more years, before finally giving up the ghost. The Cloud gradually seeped into the area, climbing out of the damaged vents, eventually blanketing the area, blotting out the sun. It became a grim, uncompromising guardian of its secrets. The maintenance crews who donned their hazmat suits and tried to fight it, succumbed to its effects, mutating and becoming the violent, savage guardians of the Sierra Madre. For centuries, the Cloud protected the casino and the villa, killing scavengers or weakening them so that they would become another victim of the tribe inhabiting it, the hazmat suited ghost people. It wasn't until the 23rd century that it became important once more. Father Elijah, a disgraced Brotherhood of Steel elder, learned of its existence from Ulysses. It inspired him. When preliminary samples taken from air on the edges of the Sierra Madre yielded promising results, he set up a chemistry set to allow it to replenish itself and traveled to the Madre in person, to perform research onsite. The Cloud is a self-replicating airborne toxin that's poisonous to living beings that causes a noticeable burning sensation in the lungs and can even enter the body through the skin. It is blood red in color, with the consistency of a dust cloud. It smells of copper, Old World gold, with a tinge of sulfur. The Cloud can be corraled and dispersed through the use of fans. Parts of the Cloud can be dispersed in the streets of Puesta del Sol by reactivating the ventilation fans. Most of the Cloud in Salida del Sol South can also be cleared. The lethal dose depends on the concentration. People outside sheltered locations in the Sierra Madre are exposed to low concentrations of the toxin. The effects include trouble with eye focus, dizziness, coughing fits, choking, vomiting and general deterioration of health as the toxins enter the system through the lungs and the skin. Unless the victim treats the damage or leaves the area, exposure is eventually lethal. For this reason, sleeping outside is a death sentence. Concentrated pockets of the Cloud are outright lethal as they directly attack the body and cause necrosis (decay). While some can survive the concentrations of the cloud for some time, if healthy enough, none can withstand its effects for long. This is made worse by the fact that there is no protection against the Cloud. Rebreathers, chemical suits and other means of protection are useless as they fail when faced by the Cloud. As damaging as the Cloud is to living beings, it preserves dead matter almost perfectly. Well built structures can last centuries intact. One effect of the Cloud is the effect it has on people wearing the Darklight hazmat suits. While outright exposure to the Cloud kills, when filtered through the suits, it apparently changes the physiology of the victim, mutating them into something else. These ghost people stalk the Sierra Madre, still wearing their hazmat suits, and are extremely tough to kill. Damage can render them inert, but the Cloud outside and that trapped within their bodies, in pockets, will eventually regenerate them. Only destroying their limbs, head or destroying the body entirely (disintegration, molecular destabilization, etc.) will permanently kill them. The Cloud's concentrations can be fashioned into consumables.  When boiled and distilled into a liquid form, mixed with pre-War potato chips, it becomes a disgusting concoction that has an invigorating effect.",

            "content": "Unique to the deadly labyrinthian streets of the Sierra Madre, the \"ghost people\" are the unintentional legacy of an agreement made between the Madre's pre-War owner Frederick Sinclair and executives of Big MT. In exchange for significant funding and access to advanced technologies developed in the Big MT research facility, Sinclair gave them free rein to use the Sierra Madre as a giant testing ground for experimental technologies. One of these experiments, entirely unknown to the construction workers employed by Sinclair to build the Villa, was the use of an experimental chemical developed by Big MT's Z-43 innovative toxins plant. The chemical turned out to be extremely toxic, airborne, and readily absorbed by the skin. These effects were first discovered when the low-quality construction of the Villa led to the ventilation system at the Puesta del Sol switching station backing up and starting to spew a rust-colored cloud that caused immediate, severe lung and tissue damage. The incident left three workers hospitalized, forcing Mr. Yesterday to hurry and try to conceal the incident from Sinclair. The station foreman investigated the matter at the request of the clinic's physician, to preempt government interest, and escalated it to Sinclair. Once he became aware of the toxins' effects, Sinclair reached out to Big MT again who offered the use of specialized chemical hazmat suits to protect the workers. Unknown to Sinclair and the workers, the Big MT executives were following up one experiment with another, supplying untested hazmat suits to fight the chemical and closely monitoring the Villa for data. The workers of the Madre were turned into unwitting test subjects, in a callous experiment that horrified the scientists responsible for creating the chemical and the suits. When the suits arrived, the workers discovered quickly that they were bulky and difficult to move in, and that the suits' cowl-like respirators made it difficult to talk, forcing the workers to resort to sign language to communicate while wearing them. They also discovered the suits were challenging to remove; unlocking the clasps typically required the assistance of another person. Despite concerns among the workers, they were immediately put to use. The chief physician suggested ordering spares, anticipating a possible leak of the toxins in the Villa. They did not even have to show Sinclair cost estimates for a wider scale chemical leak they had prepared, as Sinclair immediately greenlit the request. The construction crews were pulling double shifts already to cover for the loss of workers, knowing any chemical leaks would halt construction for the rest of the year. The first attempt to investigate how the toxic \"cloud cocktail\" had formed in the ventilation system revealed the biggest drawback of the experimental suits. While investigating the main pipe, the crews were exposed to trace amounts of the gas, which corroded the metal of the suit's locks, penetrating inside the hazmat suits and trapping the wearers within them. After failing to break the corroded clasps with regular tools, the workers were forced to use cosmic knives from the kitchens (made out of a Big MT experimental polymer) to cut themselves out of the suits and receive medical attention at the Villa clinic. While the clinic staff were not pleased with the loss of the hazmat suits, the workers considered it a necessity. When the Great War erupted and destroyed the world, the various workers and guests at the Sierra Madre were left stranded with no way to escape. While the guests and staff within the casino itself were massacred by hologram security, the fate of the workers and residents of the Villa in the aftermath is more uncertain. Some time soon after the War, the Villa's infrastructure started failing apart, slowly filling the air with the toxin that became infamously known simply as the Cloud. After several years with nobody to stop it, it came to blanket the entirety of the Sierra Madre, blotting out the sky and sun completely. Although the precise sequence of events that led to the creation of the \"ghost people\" is not known, their familiarity with the intricate layout of the Villa and always being seen wearing the hazmat suits heavily imply that they are what remains of the former workers who put the suits on to protect against the Cloud, only to end up trapped inside them and the Madre at large.\n\nDean Domino, a pre-War performer-turned-ghoul who has remained in the Sierra Madre since the War, has spent some time thinking about the mystery of how the ghost people came to be, but eventually came up empty. He does however speculate that the absence of \"focus\", something to anchor one's thoughts, was a factor contributing to their loss of faculties, similar to feral ghouls. Over the course of two centuries, the ghost people became a permanent element of the Sierra Madre, trapped within ancient hazmat suits and tied to the unique pollution that covers the complex. he Cloud's decaying touch twisted the ghost people to the point that when sufficient force manages to penetrate the suits, pockets of compressed gas are visibly released. and emit a green, gaseous cloud at regular intervals from the suit's vents and rebreather. Their mutated flesh and blood are discolored yellow, and apparently tastes like plastic or copper. similar to how the Cloud itself tastes. The main effect of the mutation is that the ghost people are very hard to kill. gun shots or stab wounds that would kill regular humans only render them inert for a short period of time. Shortly afterwards, they start twitching, making gaseous noises, then get up and continue their attack. The only reliable method is to dismember, disintegrate, or otherwise blow them up. Devouring them also works. Like ghouls and super mutants, they also appear to be unable of dying due to old age. This is likely tied to the potential restorative effects of processed Cloud, which invigorates, rather than decays. Either the mutation or the stiff, bulky suits also cause the ghost people to move in an unnatural manner. They have a hunched posture with their hands held up and unnaturally curled fingers, and move in a manner akin to shambling, dragging their feet and twisting their torso, as if to pull the leg forward. Finally, the ghost people do not speak, though it's unclear if it is the mutation itself, or the suits' rebreathers that prevent communication. While the ghost people appear similar to feral ghouls at a glance, there are some major differences. The main one is that they are not actually feral. Although the Cloud twisted them, they retain the ability to use tools and weapons. While they do not use firearms, they are very adept at using improvised spears, bear traps as gauntlets, and even crafting improvised explosives. Furthermore, while feral ghouls attack on sight with no sense of self-preservation, ghost people often use traps to ambush unwary victims (typically bear traps or falling beams) and use bait to lure prey.  Supplies useful to those exploring the Madre are commonly used as bait. Ghost people are one of the main hazards at the Madre and attack any outsiders with unrestrained aggression once they learn of their presence. As a result, anyone who braves the open desert to reach it, is immediately attacked by the Cloud and the ghost people. If they come as part of a group, then greed and the prospect of an untouched pre-War resort to loot frequently leads to infighting. Ghost people do not typically roam the Villa in large numbers, however, and only small groups will appear in the ruins under normal circumstances. They are more prevalent in the outlying western and eastern districts of Puesta del Sol and Salida del Sol. The bulk of them haunt the derelict buildings and underground service networks. These ghost people will only emerge in response to a significant change in the ambient noise of the Madre,  which triggers a violent reaction, as larger numbers of ghost people emerge to investigate the disturbance. This change can be anything significantly out of the ordinary, such as music loud noises,  or even shouting:  God setting off the Villa police station alarm to prevent Elijah from contacting Dog also inadvertently caused the ghost people to flock to the station. The holographic greeter at the station kept them from entering it, as the ghost people are fascinated by the holograms, in what is described as a form of \"ghost worship\" by God. Ghost people revere the holograms, and over time may even come to regard certain humans as holograms, leaving them in peace. All ghost people are hostile to the Courier. They are difficult to pin down, as they will constantly lurch and leap around during engagements. They also actively avoid a the player's aim, particularly near their head. They do not utilize firearms, using only primitive weapons made from resources found in the Sierra Madre villa. Ghost people also do not take extra damage from headshots. This is somewhat balanced by their complete lack of functioning armor.\n\nThey are difficult to kill permanently by normal means. They must be disintegrated, dismembered or eaten by Dog, or they will simply get up and continue attacking. The simplest way to keep them from getting back up is to cripple or dismember their limbs with a melee weapon (like a cosmic knife), an explosive (like a demolition charge) or from concentrated ranged attacks to a single limb. The loss of a limb will always kill the ghost person. If a ghost person is already down, attack with a melee weapon or target their limbs with a ranged weapon until a limb is removed to stop them from reviving. The revival of the ghost people is indicated by characteristic gurgling, so it is recommended to either stand back or quickly destroy one of their limbs before they wake up. When a ghost person revives their limb health is severely reduced, making it easier to kill them permanently. Often the only warning of their presence is a strangled choking or muttering sound they make. Ghost harvesters are the most common variant of ghost people. They are the smallest variant and are easily distinguished by their hoods and smaller gas masks. They are equipped with knife spears and throwing knife spears, using the throwing spears until they are expended and then charging the target equipped with a knife spear unless the prey closes to melee range first. Ghost trappers can be identified by their large size and lack of hoods. They are only equipped with bear trap fists. Ghost trappers are also responsible for the inordinate amount of bear traps and trip wires in the Sierra Madre. They are capable and tough unarmed fighters, so they are best picked off from a distance. However, ghost trappers are often found in groups with knife spear-bearing harvesters or seekers. Ghost seekers are the least common variant of ghost people. They are taller than ghost harvesters but smaller than ghost trappers and wear a hood. They are equipped with knife spears and gas bombs, throwing one or two gas bombs and then closing to attack with a knife spear. While they do not withstand as much damage as ghost trappers, ghost seekers are extremely capable in melee combat. The gas bombs that seekers throw can cripple limbs.",

            "content": "Nuka-World is a pre-War amusement park turned raider settlement in 2287. It is in Massachusetts, west of Boston. After Nuka-Cola's success on the national market, the soda-themed amusement park, Nuka-World, opened its gates for the first time on May 1, 2050. On opening day, over 40,000 tickets were sold. Due to the overwhelming success, plans to expand beyond the original two parks, Nuka-Town USA and Kiddie Kingdom, were set in motion immediately. The additions included Dry Rock Gulch in 2058, followed by Safari Adventure in 2067. The result was ticket sales nearly doubling overnight. Demand for space, housing, and parking resulted in the construction of an employee community in 2060, dubbed Bradberton, Massachusetts, for park staff members to live, reducing commute times and traffic congestion. The last park area, Galactic Zone, opened to the public in 2072, was the last expansion to the park before the war. Although incredibly popular, the amusement park struggled to maintain proper standards, especially as the Sino-American War dragged on. The primary reason for the deterioration was John-Caleb Bradberton's obsession with prolonging his own life. In March 2076, he struck a deal with General Braxton. In return for granting the military access to his Beverageer Division and their expertise for the Project Cobalt chemical weapons program, Bradberton would gain access to the military Life Extension And Prolongation Program.  The military contract took absolute priority. Bradberton poured his personal fortune and diverted funds from Nuka-World's operating budget towards Project Cobalt and LEAP-X. He spared no expense, including bankrolling salaries for LEAP-X researchers to ensure both projects would reach completion. Although the cuts in Nuka-World's budget resulted in aforementioned decline in standards, Bradberton considered the park expendable, believing that nuclear war would render amusement parks obsolete. By 2077, the poorly engineered and maintained rides caused constant accidents, injuries, and even fatalities: In 2076 alone, Del Walsh, the resident paramedic, treated 7 broken bones, 9 major lacerations, 78 muscle injuries and 166 minor lacerations all caused by ride malfunctions, and the first six months of 2077 saw two people outright killed at the park. The lax attitude affected even personnel, and unsanitary conditions due to neglect and carelessness were common, even at medical facilities at the park. The military projects thrived, on the other hand. After the Cobalt team produced an isotope of strontium-90 that could be used as a coating for power armor in October 2076, just six months after starting, they focused on refining the isotope for further use. Applications included a custom munition for the prototypical M42 Fat Man and a safely deployed from something as simple as a Thirst Zapper. The isotope could even be used \"somewhat safely\" in a new type of beverage, the Nuka-Cola Quantum, named after the isotope designation in the Beverageer's system. Collaboration with the military and other military contractors, in particular RobCo Industries, Nuka-World gained access to military-grade robotics. Concentrated primarily at the Galactic Zone's Battlezone, the models included Protectrons, sentry bots, and Assaultrons. Every robot was controlled by a cutting-edge STAR mainframe, which would allow Bradberton to control the machines, defending the park if necessary.  To bolster his personal security, a private sanctuary was built beneath Nuka-Town USA by Vault-Tec.  As a result of the decreasing support for staff and lack of critical upgrades, adding this caliber of robotics made the employees even more nervous. Employees who spoke up about their concerns were fired, putting even more strain on those that remained. Their concerns were confirmed shortly thereafter when employee Tim Wittingstone was accidentally shot to death by the robotic performers. Undeterred by the incidents and complaints, Bradberton forged ahead, ordering Quantum to be fast-tracked through the approval process and presented as the culmination of a three-year research program. During quality control testing, at least 62 test subjects died as a result of organ failure, with many more hospitalized with radiation burns before a safe isotope was created.  Bradberton having held up his end of the bargain, the general did the same, moving forward with the final step of the LEAP-X process to sustain Bradberton's life indefinitely. The original intention of LEAP-X was to create a living bio-suit to preserve his body, but Bradberton was nonplussed to learn the power and component requirements rendered this plan impossible, and that only fifteen pounds of organic matter could be accommodated. If he wanted to move forward and prolong his life, only his head could be preserved. In January 2077, he confirmed his wishes to the team. Over the following months, Bradberton sorted his affairs, only sharing his plans with his executive assistant, Peyton Huxley, whom he had entrusted to act on his behalf should something go awry. On April 2, 2077, Bradberton underwent the surgical procedure, his head successfully removed and transferred into the LEAP-X system. He had instructed his assistant to bring him daily updates should he live, as Peyton was the only one outside the LEAP-X team who knew about the procedure. The Great War occurred six months later, resulting in Bradberton having successfully survived both the surgery and nuclear onslaught, remaining unscathed in his vault underneath the amusement park.\n\nPost-War, Nuka-World became the site of a small trading settlement inhabited by peaceful settlers and traders. However, the park's resources and defensive layout made it a desirable target for the raider gangs in the area. Inspired by Porter Gage, a raider named Colter united the Operators, Disciples, and the Pack and seized control of the park. Overboss Colter and his subordinates turned the park into their fortress, enslaving the original inhabitants and using it as a staging point for small-scale raiding operations.",

            "constant": false,
            "content": "Nuka-Cola is the flagship product of the Nuka-Cola Corporation and one of the symbols of United States culture. Introduced in 2044, it rapidly dominated the soft drink market, eventually becoming the most popular soda on the market and a staple of American culture. Bottled and distributed nationwide, Nuka-Cola was available in such numbers that even two centuries after the Great War put a stop to all major bottling operations, Nuka-Cola bottles can still be found in the wastelands in large quantities. In the aftermath of the Great War, Nuka-Cola bottle caps became the de facto currency in most post-War societies. Nuka-Cola entered the beverage market in 2044, with the invention of the soft drink by John-Caleb Bradberton after two years of experimentation. Though strictly unhealthy (containing 120% of the recommended daily allowance of sugar), it took the United States market by storm and within a year it could be purchased nationwide. Its popularity rapidly increased and within several years it was the most popular beverage across the globe. The constant drive to improve and innovate the formula resulted in numerous flavor variations, with the most popular ones like cherry, grape, and orange released just a few years after the drink debuted. Whenever the company encountered competition, it would attempt to deal with it aggressively. Cherry and grape variants of the Nuka-Cola were patents acquired by the company after identifying individual competitors. In other cases, the corporation would attempt to buy out competitors, as was the case with Sunset Sarsaparilla in 2058 and Vim! Pop Incorporated in 2077. Failing that, it would attempt to release a competing drink accompanied by a massive promotional campaign. After attempts to acquire Sunset Sarsaparilla failed, Nuka-Cola attempted to directly compete with it through Nuka-Cola Wild and the opening of Dry Rock Gulch at Nuka-World. Though it gained a respectable popularity in the American Southwest, it failed to match that of Sunset Sarsaparilla. The latest Nuka-Cola taste variant was created in October 2076, as the head of the chemical weapons program instigated by John-Caleb Bradberton reported that his team created an isotope of strontium-90 that could be reliably weaponized, as a coating for power armor, a custom munition for the prototypical M42 Fat Man or even an area effect weapon that could be safely deployed from something as simple as a Thirst Zapper. It could also be used \"somewhat safely\" in a new kind of Nuka-Cola. Bradberton ordered it to be put into production, as Nuka-Cola Quantum (named after the isotope designation in the beverageer's system). Quantum was fast-tracked through the approval process, presented as the culmination of a three year research program. To create an isotope safe for human consumption, focus groups were used to test various variants of the Quantum isotope. After numerous casualties (at least 62 test subjects died as a result of organ failure, with many more hospitalized with radiation burns; families were provided with Nuka Condolences Fruit and Cheese Packages that contained liability waivers), a safe isotope was created and the first cases of Nuka-Cola Quantum hit the market in select cities on the East Coast, like Boston and Washington, D.C. Even after the War obliterated the parent corporation, Nuka-Cola would continue to be the most popular soft drink on the North American continent, available in almost limitless quantities. Despite being warm and flat, it holds the allegiance of many and continues to addict wastelanders.\n\nIngredients\nCarbonated water\nSugar or aspartame\nCaffeine\nPhosphoric acid\nCitric acid\nCaramel color\nPotassium benzoate\nNatural flavorings\nThe unique taste of Nuka-Cola is the result of a combination of seventeen fruit essences, balanced to enhance the classic cola flavor. The balance is precarious and minute adjustments can affect it severely. Such was the case when the freshly launched Nuka-Cola was reformulated in response to the Great Passion Fruit Famine of 2044 and consumers noticed the change in flavor. Nuka-Cola contains excessive amounts of caffeine and 120% of the recommended daily value of sugar, making it decisively unhealthy for extended consumption. To counter the negative image, it was marketed as being fortified with vitamins, minerals and \"health tonics.\" Intensive consumption can cause Nuka-Cola addiction, which can lead to splitting headaches if Nuka-Cola isn't consumed on a regular basis. The iconic curved Nuka-Cola bottle was used by the company ever since its introduction in 2044. The Dazzling Blue color of the glass was popular with consumers: Market research in 2052 indicated that 86 out of 100 polled consumers chose blue as their favorite color. Nuka-Cola was forced to replace the curved design with a rocket-shaped bottle in 2077. It was the result of long-running litigation over patent infringement, a case that the Nuka-Cola Corporation lost. However, consumers reacted positively to the new Space Age bottle and Nuka-Cola's sales increased even further. Nuka-Cola was also distributed in soda fountains and cans, although these forms of distribution were far less popular than the iconic bottle, with cans finding its niche around the midwestern United States. The surge in popularity led to Nuka-Cola spreading nationwide. By 2067, there was a vending machine on almost every street in America, offering regular Nuka-Cola and any of its variants. Popularity of its variants strongly depended on the region, with western states strongly favoring Nuka-Cola Quartz, Victory and the root-beer flavored Wild (competing with Sunset Sarsaparilla). More urbanized eastern states favored classic tastes, such as Nuka-Grape, Nuka-Cola Orange and Nuka-Cherry. The original branding of Nuka-Cola was very basic but extremely effective. Marketed towards the family (but largely the children), and would even be swept up in the jingoism of the American culture of the time with ads and event featuring prominent military weaponry  and would even paint power armor in the branding of Nuka-Cola. However, a lawsuit that settled against the Nuka-Cola Corporation for use of Nuka-Cola's bottle design allowed them to rebrand starting with the product itself. Nuka-Cola would take a radical change to Nuka-Cola's image to a Space Age theme with bottles taking on the shape of a rocketship. To compliment the new rocket ship bottle, a mascot from 2062 would begin to see reuse because of her glove-like suit fit the Space Age theme: the Nuka-Girl in a skimpy spacesuit with her raygun the Thirst Zapper. The logotype of Nuka-Cola would utilize basic brush script font in white with a unique 'N' and additional brush strokes for the hyphen and could also be underlined or stacked based on layout. Red would be the only color to compliment the white text, which both in turn compliment the black hue of Nuka-Cola. In the latter part of 2077, an orange stroke began to appear in advertisements but did not become ubiquitous because of the Great War. The use of this logotype is the most common among Nuka-Cola's products, but there were some problems with consistency in advertisements. To differentiate variant flavors of Nuka-Cola from one another, different logos would also be developed for each flavor, but each one would complement the base Nuka-Cola logotype which was always printed in smaller type on the flavor's label. This branding consistency would also carry over to locations, such as Nuka-World which uses the same font type for its logo. Nuka-Cola became a nationally-recognized brand through a combination of aggressive marketing and hostile corporate practices, including takeovers and undermining its competition. The preferred approach was to acquire popular local sodas and rebrand or remarket them as Nuka-Cola variants. Such was the case with two of its flagship flavors, Nuka-Cherry and Nuka-Grape, originally Merle's Very Cherry Soda and Grape-Pearl Soda. Larger companies were typically more resilient and rebuffed Nuka-Cola's advances. One such case is Sunset Sarsaparilla, a sarsaparilla popular in the southwestern United States. When negotiations with the company fell through in 2058, Nuka-Cola attempted to compete by launching a rival soda, Nuka-Cola Wild. Another competitor is Vim! soda, a popular Maine drink. Owned by a single family, Vim! repeatedly refused offers from Nuka-Cola. In response, the company sued Vim! for copyright infringement (over the new Vim! Quartz soda) and committed industrial espionage and sabotage of its operations, effectively immune to prosecution thanks to John-Caleb Bradberton's ties with the government and the military.",

It was a byproduct of Project Cobalt, which began in 2076 when Nuka-Cola Corporation engaged in weapons research under U.S. military sponsorship. The team found that a strontium-90 isotope derivative, originally developed for military ordnance, created a bright blue glow that worked well as a food additive when adjusted for consumption. The lead Beverageer, Rex Meacham, gave the new drink formula its distinctive name. Live testing of the drink, codenamed \"Sea Lion,\" occurred at other regional facilities. Experimentation with other isotopes showed that none worked as effectively or as safely as strontium-90. Initial testing with the drink led to significant health problems and even deaths among taste testers, but waivers allowed the company to avoid litigation and adjustments created a final product with only mild side effects. It ultimately passed inspections supervised by the \"Food and Drug Association\" and was marketed in the fourth quarter of 2077 as a new flavor of Nuka-Cola with \"Twice the calories, twice the carbohydrates, twice the caffeine, and twice the taste!\" The flavor itself was modified via an 18th ingredient: pomegranate fruit flavoring. However, Quantum's appearance and the added isotope were controversial, and the public was divided on the drink. It was released as part of a limited test run, and only the Nuka-Cola plant in Washington, D.C. produced it at a commercial scale before the Great War. Nuka-Cola Quantum was officially released to the public at the same time as the Great War,  and so the soda is incredibly rare in the wasteland, with many bottles found in trucks that were shipping the product.\n\nThe Washington, D.C. area was the first test market for Quantum, with special \"pre-release\" shipments delivered to certain grocers and restaurants. The drink can also be found in the Commonwealth and Appalachia, the latter because the Whitespring Resort also received early-release shipments, which are sold by the Nuka-Cola vendor Bubbles.",

            "content": "The Sunset Sarsaparilla Company was founded in 1918, making it 126 years older than the Nuka-Cola Corporation. According to Festus, a small town saloon owner decided one day to brew a new type of soft drink. He asked his usual patrons what flavor they would want it to be, but they were of no help. However, a stranger at the end of the bar suggested he make a sarsaparilla flavored drink, and would give his family's recipe to the saloon owner if he got to sample a bottle whenever he wanted to make sure the recipe was being followed to the letter. The saloon owner agreed, thinking it would make him rich. The stranger then left to meet him the next day at sundown. The next day, the saloon owner was told by the sheriff that the stranger was killed by bandits on the side of the town road. Cursing his luck, the saloon owner closed his store early that day, just as the sun began to set. But after he locked the doors, he found a bottle with a note under it sealed with blue wax in the shape of a star. Opening it, he found the recipe of a sarsaparilla-flavored drink. After sampling the contents of the bottle, and finding it singularly delicious, he began selling Sunset Sarsaparilla and even paid for the stranger's funeral, believing that it was the least he could do for his mysterious benefactor. To this day, some bottles of Sunset Sarsaparilla have a bottle cap marked with a blue star that some say the saloon owner mandated, while some say it is the stranger continuing to sample the bottles like he was promised. After years of selling their beverage and becoming known and loved across the West Coast, the company soon decided to invest in automation and robotics, specifically with the help of RobCo Industries. While the custodial staff reaped the benefits of automation, the regional distribution network unfortunately suffered replacement at the hands of an experimental robot. At some point before the Great War, a TV network broadcast an advisory about the health risks of their soda, with studies claiming a wide range of harmful side effects came from having too much of it. Sunset Sarsaparilla disputed the claims as unverified and based off larger quantities of Sarsaparilla than anyone could possibly drink. Nevertheless, the company took steps to improve its PR after the story aired. By 2077, the company had continued to boom, although they struggled with sales in the Northeastern region, they sold more in the Northern and Midwestern United States, continuing to sell extremely well in the American Southwest. However, by sheer luck, a rumor of a contest surfaced, telling of the company having a contest to redeem starred bottle caps for prizes. Despite the complaints of staff, the company decided to promote the contest rather than denounce the rumor, due to 300% increases in sales. The company also went as far as to install an automaton in the lobby of their headquarters, as well as creating an advertisement campaign heavily based on cowboys.  Before the Great War, a competitor attempted to negotiate a deal to buy out the Sunset Sarsaparilla Company, but the offer was declined. On the other end of the deal was none other than John-Caleb Bradberton, founder, CEO, and president of the rival Nuka-Cola Corporation. In response to this failed deal, he commissioned the development and release of a root-beer flavored variant of his signature drink. An exclusive for the Nuka-World theme park and other promotional deals like the Whitespring Resort, the result was Nuka-Cola Wild, an attempt by Bradberton to capitalize on the success of the Sunset Sarsaparilla brand. The star cap story began as a simple promotional story before the Great War, yet Festus kept the story alive by motivating survivors to collect Sunset Sarsaparilla bottle caps, and as the years went by, a new legend began to circulate around the bottling headquarters in Las Vegas, which in turn led to the announcement of the running \"Legend of the Star\" collection campaign. Stories of the contest became very distorted following the Great War, and the actual simple prize (which consisted of a retelling of the fictitious story by the company spokesbot and a small metal Sunset Sarsaparilla deputy badge) became a bloated tale of pre-War technology, weapons caches, and all sorts of other amazing loot.",

At the end of the third quarter in October 2077, the corporation was nearly 3.29 million dollars in the red, with more than 20% of the company's expenditures going toward repairs, more than on marketing (14.9%), production (14.4%), or distribution (10.0%). In addition, Vim! Pop had just gotten out a litigation with the Nuka-Cola Corporation over the trademark on the Quartz name, losing them further revenue from that source as well. Accordingly, the main investors in the company began to lose faith and were considering selling their stocks to Nuka-Cola, which would effectively make Vim! Pop a subsidiary of the soft drink giant. Despite all of these hindrances, CEO Doyle Reed was determined to keep the company independent of the Nuka-Cola Corporation and sell Vim nationwide, and launched several campaigns. In order to widen their consumer base, the corporation began the \"Vim Ambassador\" advertisement campaign, whereby power armored ambassadors bearing the distinctive white and red colors of the brand would travel to communities and hand out free bottles of Vim, Vim Quartz and Vim Refresh in addition to answering questions and providing contact information for the corporation's sales distribution team. However, this advertising campaign came with its own set of problems, particularly with crime: for example, one of suits of power armor was stolen right off the truck, and one ambassador was physically assaulted by a bar patron, completely unprovoked. The head of distribution, Willis Rudd, was even convinced that the company was being intentionally targeted and it was not simply bad luck: their delivery trucks had been stolen and shot up, their drivers had been jumped and even machine technicians reported tampering. Rudd was correct; the Nuka Cola Corporation had hired Aubrey Copland to sabotage Vim! Pop Incorporated, and goad them to being bought out. The plan was divided into three phases: the goal of phase one to disrupt local confidence in Vim by placing \"out of order\" signs on vending machines, replacing cases of pop with tainted bottles and covering Vim advertisements with those of Nuka-Cola. Additionally, Madison Young would work from the inside of the company, pointing out losses to investors and pointing then toward Nuka Cola.  The next phase included escalation of force, such as random thefts and assaulting workers to lower morale, making it obvious enough that they are being targeted, but not enough to launch an investigation. The final phase included stealing the recipe for their newest soft drink (Captain's Blend) so Nuka-Cola could beat them to it. Regardless of the distribution fiascos and sabotage, the corporation's \"Escape into Adventure\" campaign was largely successful, with 87% of those polled feeling \"excited\" or \"intrigued\" by the ads, and 56% of those people saying they would be likely to purchase a bottle of Vim after seeing the ads.  Especially after the litigation over the Quartz brand, the corporation also found hope with a new flavor of pop tentatively named \"Captain's Blend\" which was popular with taste testers, who predominantly described the flavor as \"fishy.\" Of course, the troubles of the company all ended when the Great War broke out; compared to nuclear annihilation and the factory under attack, hemorrhaging money, failed ad campaigns and lawsuits did not seem too dire at all.",

It hadn't yet been released on the market, though it was noted as being remarkably popular among focus groups. The #1 word used to describe the taste was \"fishy.\" The company higher-ups were confused as to the popularity of the taste and were hesitant to put it out for a full release. The inspiration for the drink's odd flavor came from the marketing department team member Norman Fuller's request to put the \"taste of Maine in a bottle.\" In fact, even the CEO hadn't been made aware of the ingredients causing the popular fishy taste.\n\nThe Captain's Blend is a result of Vim! research and development team member Iris Mason getting frustrated with Norman's vague request and taking bottles of Vim and mixing in fiddleheads, lobster shells and various extracts. Aster was later added to mask the aroma of the lobster shells. One thing working to the detriment of Captain's Blend, however, was testers remarking that it caused an odd-smelling sweat. One tester remarked that another \"smelled like a pier\" after drinking the beverage. However, a side effect of the smell was how it made lobsters less prone to attack a commercial fisherman when he was removing them from the cages. All Vim Captain's Blend bottles have the word \"Tester\" printed on their label. Said label's rather simplistic blue and white print might be attributed to the product still being in its testing stage. The glass bottle's coloration is not clearly discernible due to it being almost completely full, but the beverage inside glows brightly purple.",

            "content": "Power armor, also referred to as powered armor, powered combat infantry armor, and powered infantry armor, is a type of personal infantry suit intended for combat and heavy-labor roles. Power armor development first began before the Great War in 2065 by United States defense contractors, including West Tek. Both before and after the war, power armor represents the pinnacle of personal defensive technology, providing its users with excellent energy, ballistic and even radiation protection, as well as drastically increased strength. Organizations such as the Garrahan Mining Company and the Enclave would also later develop their own models of power armor.  Few factions are capable of maintaining or fielding power armor in substantial numbers, with even less being capable of manufacturing them. Some of the most prominent factions that use power armor are the Brotherhood of Steel and the Enclave. Other groups, such as the NCR, Commonwealth raiders and the Gunners are shown to posses and utilize power armor to a lesser extent. All power armor models in the United States share a common heritage and basic design. Each power armor is built around the West Tek power armor frame, with an internalized servomotor system, providing increased strength, resistance to trauma, and radiation protection. The operator controls the armor indirectly, using manipulators that steer the hands and feet while being safely isolated from the environment. Of note is integrated hydraulic shock absorption system which allows the operator to jump from major heights without damage. The safety of airborne deployments depends primarily on the model of the armor, with the survivable height for early T-60 models being about one hundred feet. The survivable fall height increased to more than three times the height in later versions. Naturally, the enhanced strength also allows the use of hard armored plating that would otherwise be impossible for the soldier to carry with ease. The basic version of each power armor is designated with either model A or Mark I. Subsequent revisions and upgrades are distinguished using sequential letters: B, C, D, E, and F, or Mark II, III, IV, V, and VI. Each represents an incremental upgrade over the preceding model. Beyond general revisions, a large number of upgrades and custom internals has been developed for the various power armor units, to increase their flexibility and performance on the battlefield. Although the United States military remained the principal operator of power armor, select private corporations also had access to the technology. One of these, the Garrahan Mining Company, used West-Tek’s power armor technology to create a competitive powered mining suit, the Excavator power armor, in a bid to defeat its competitors and secure lucrative contracts for exploiting Appalachian natural resources. Another Appalachian company, Grafton Steel, would attempt to develop a heat resistant armor based off of the T-51 for work in their steel mills but would fail to complete it before the bombs fell. Other private companies with access to power armor included both Nuka-Cola and its Maine based rival Vim! Pop. With military permission both would use customized suits of armor for promotional purposes, but the former would take their military relationship one step further and actively contribute to military weapons and armor development via research into their Quantum compound.",

            "content": "Commissioned by the Joint Chiefs, the development of the X-01 began shortly before the Great War. It represented a radically new approach to designing powered armor, eschewing traditional design philosophies that defined the T series. X-O1 was a high-profile research project meant to supersede previous power armor models. A single suit of X-01 was provided to the Nuka-Cola Corporation, as part of Project Cobalt. While the suit served as a successful proof of concept of using a strontium-90 based plating over the armor, this improvement was not adopted into the armor's schematics before the onset of the Great War. Further development was made impossible due to the outbreak of the Great War. After the Great War, a select few suits were engineered further and employed by remnants of the U.S. military, like the Enclave and Brotherhood of Steel, as well as the Institute. The schematics for the armor were saved by the Enclave just before the bombs fell, with the organization keeping copies in the archives of their Poseidon and Whitespring facilities, including Control Station ENCLAVE. This allowed the Enclave to create a limited production run of the suits, and for work to eventually continue on the model's development. Full development was restarted by the Enclave in 2198, although it wasn't until 2215 that the research efforts began in earnest under the presidential mandate, resulting in the creation of the first model of Advanced power armor in 2220. Another group to develop upon the X-01 design, after the war, is the Institute. Despite lacking access to the prototype's schematics, by 2287, the Institute had developed a modified polymerized casting mix to coat the armor, as well as other modifications that enhance the user's intelligence.",

Their clandestine - and illicit - use of the drug made its use by amateurs popular and widespread. With it, they could run longer and work out harder without the burden of \"unnecessary\" training. The popularity of the drug resulted in a number of hybridized variants, including Bufftats (mixed with Mentats) and Psychobuff (military modification, combined with Psycho). It was sold before the war in bottles of 50 tablets each. Its popularity persists well after the nuclear holocaust, due to its properties. The increase in strength allows a wastelander to punch through several wooden boards with ease and pummel opponents into submission. Despite being an addictive steroid, with proper use, Buffout can easily treat rickets in children.",

            "constant": false,
            "content": "Jet is a highly addictive chem commonly found throughout the wasteland. It is extracted from brahmin dung fumes and commonly administered via an inhaler. Although first available before the Great War in a different form, in the first half of the 23rd century, Myron developed Jet into a highly marketable commodity and tool for the enslavement of Redding by the Mordinos of New Reno. Even after the death of Myron and subsequent fall of the Mordinos from relevancy, Jet's availability, replicability, and popularity developed exponentially. The introduction of the Jet antidote would barely slow its wide effect and appeal on both the West Coast and the East Coast of the former United States. Jet is a powerful hallucinogenic chem that stimulates the central nervous system, triggering a rush of energy and strength primarily brought about by endorphins. The initial euphoric rush rarely lasts more than a few minutes, but the altered state of consciousness makes it subjectively longer for any Jet user. Post-War Jet is typically sold packaged into small, disposable ampules or canisters (rarely in half-ounce bags), designed for use with a metered-dose inhaler (sometimes sold separately). The goal is to deliver the aerosolized drug directly into the lungs of the user, where it is rapidly absorbed into the bloodstream. To maximize high, dealers would recommend taking a dose, followed by a deep breath and time to let it settle. Wholesale buyers, like Redding in the 2240s, usually receive bulk packages that have to be processed into user ampules first. This requires clean facilities and medical training to do properly, as poor processing will result in contamination and expose users to disease. Jet may also be mixed with saline solutions or other liquids to be delivered intravenously. This was the preferred method of researchers working at the Stables. Standard Jet is highly addictive, inducing psychological and physical reliance. Both stem from the way their Jet alters the perception of reality, to the point that the euphoric rush brought about by the drug is interpreted by the user as the norm and sobriety as the abnormal. Drug addictions caused by regular Jet responded to treatment with Fixer and Addictol, increasing their popularity both before and after the Great War. Jet proliferated throughout the wasteland in the wake of the Great War, particularly due to the ease of manufacture. As long as a chemist had access to a reliable source of fertilizer, they could manufacture it in quantity, even in the most barren of environments (as was the case with Great Khans at Red Rock Canyon).",

The active ingredient is a powerful nootropic that increases memory-related functions, and speeds other mental processes. Students and those in other fields requiring intensive thought would also take Mentats for its mental benefits, though Mentats also had a reputation for being a drug for \"beatniks and armchair philosophers,\" according to Judith Blackwell. The effect of Mentants is temporary, leaving the user tired and sluggish once it wears off. The drug seems to have a profound effect on a developing adolescent mind, which results in a permanent and noticeable intelligence increase. Mentats can further be used by those suffering from Alzheimer's disease to curb the degeneration of mind and keep the user sharp and lucid when they would otherwise be delirious and unattentive. However, excessive consumption could also result in health complications, including recurring migraines from withdrawal and even worsening or developing debilitating neurological disorders. Mentats packages (available both as cardboard packs and tins) sold well, with their popularity surviving the Great War and making them a popular drug across the wasteland. Some chemists even figured out how to iterate on the design and create special blends of Mentats. The professor from Broken Hills allegedly developed an easy method to mass-produce Mentats, likely owing to its ubiquitous nature across the country, even years after production ceased.",

            "content": "A military-grade psychosis-inducing amphetamine, Psycho is provided in a unique delivery system that mixes strange chemicals of military origin immediately prior to injection. The drug was created by a private company, operated as a research division of the United States Army, founded by General Constantine Chase. It entered combat use during the final stages of the Anchorage Reclamation, to reduce the impact of attrition on U.S. forces deployed to the Alaskan front. Its deployment was authorized by General Chase and his chief medical officer, Dr. Adrienn Adami, despite the clinical trials being incomplete at the time. Psycho's primary effect is an increase in damage resistance and dampening of higher brain functions, intended to create tough shock troops for human-wave assaults. The caveat is that the dampening effect also makes the soldiers hard to control. Some variants of Psycho, based around similar chemicals, also increase combat performance by speeding up reflexes and bodily functions to allow the soldiers to deal more damage, though said variant precluded the damage resistance boost. Both cause them to be particularly jumpy and aggressive. Due to the rushed nature of the drug's development and deployment, numerous side effects manifest as a result of Psycho usage. Chief among these is that the stimulant can cause users with weak hearts to suffer a fatal heart attack. Long term effects include dementia, psychosis, elevated levels of aggression, and general agitation. It may also cause internal damage.  Addiction aggravates the adverse symptoms. Long term Psycho addiction may progress to the point that standard treatment options available in the wasteland, such as Addictol, are no longer effective in treating the habit.",

A wonder of pre-War science, stimpaks are typically syringes filled with a mixture of healing agents and stimulants, allowing the user to boost their own body's natural regenerative functions. In most cases, it leads to an almost instantaneous regeneration of wounds. The syringe is equipped with a gauge for quickly identifying the state of the contents and can be used either in an intravenous or intramuscular fashion. Although now commonly used for healing bullet holes and stab wounds, stimpaks were employed professionally through Auto-Docs (in conjunction with Med-X and other painkillers) for postoperative care and recovery.  John Cassidy speaks of their efficacy, expressing gratitude that millions were produced before the Great War, still abundant several centuries after.\n\nStimpaks can also be used to treat physical conditions, such as a heart condition, but only temporarily. However, the basic stimpak is designed for use on moderate or severe wounds, as the soup of healing medication is ineffective at treating major trauma. A stimpak also does not prevent scarring from excessive third-degree burns or additional extensive scarring as it simply boosts natural regenerative functions.  Expiration is a concern for those who use stimpaks, but other than giving a weaker boost to healing, they function just as an unexpired stimpak. Chemists with sufficient knowledge can create new stimpaks. To this end, more advanced variants of the stimpak were developed. The super stimpak is the most common variant, containing an additional vial of more drastic healing chems, dramatically increasing the healing effect. However, the healing effect will eventually cause minor trauma to the tissues healed due to the potency of the drug.",

In layman's terms, it's a powerful pain killer delivered via a hypodermic needle.\n\nGiven its usefulness, Med-X is one of the more widespread pre-War chems, providing pain relief and recreation across the continent. Morphinists can be identified by contracted pupils and involuntary spasms. Five doses of Med-X have the potential to be fatal with 15 guaranteeing a lethal overdose.",

The PDQ-88b securitron is heavily-armed. Its left arm contains a Glastinghouse, Inc. X-25 Gatling laser for medium range engagements. For close-range suppression and crowd control, the securitron mounts a 9mm submachinegun in its right arm. However, these are only secondary weapons: concealed compartments in its shoulders contain M-235 missile launchers for long range and surface-to-air engagements, and a rapid-fire G-28 grenade launching system for close range engagements. The robots also have onboard auto-repair systems to repair any damage sustained from combat. Thus armed, a securitron can handle nearly any combat situation.\n\nThe PDQ-88b securitron supports two operating systems: Mk I and Mk II. The Mk I operating system lacks drivers for the auto-repair systems and shoulder-mounted weapons, limiting the robot's arsenal to the built-in X-25 Gatling laser and the 9mm submachinegun. The Mk II operating system enables the M-235 missile launchers, the rapid-fire G-28 grenade launching system and the auto-repair system. As estimated by Mr. House and Yes Man, the combat effectiveness of each securitron unit is improved by 235% by the upgrade. A large number of PDQ-88b securitron units were acquired by the Big MT company for reverse engineering (fueled by Doctor 0's bitter hatred of Robert House), with the aim of creating a superior model. However, these efforts were ineffective: the only functional unit created by Doctor 0 was Muggy, a miniature, cookware-obsessed robot. Other securitrons, while benefitting from increased accuracy, firepower and more efficient self-repair routines provided by Big MT firmware (Mk I through VI), are either berserk or irreparably damaged due to critical errors in Dr 0's operating systems. A final feature of the securitron is the housed printer inside their chassis, able to receive broadcasts and print leaflets, such as obituaries, should such an occasion occur.",

            "content": "Liberators were small pre-War drones used by the People's Liberation Army. These military infiltration and attack robots were weak and ineffective, and became a joke among soldiers who were forced to waste ammunition on them. A team of researchers at the covert Fujiniya Intelligence Base in Appalachia decided to improve the design. The inferior Liberator prototype was revamped in numerous ways. The new Liberator series (designated Mark 0 – V) had an intimidating paint job and a set of speakers designed to spout propaganda. These propaganda messages would boost the morale of friendly forces while sapping that of their foes. The spontaneous detonation caused by capture avoidance systems was resolved in the new model, alongside a large number of improvements to its weapons systems. The low-powered laser that maimed instead of killing targets was replaced with a high-powered version, while an additional spinning blade was added to give it an edge in melee engagements. Attempts to provide it with deployment capability, allowing it to attack and deploy as a mobile turret on any surface, were postponed until the next version, the Mark VI. The new-model liberators were inexpensive to manufacture and easy to deploy via the facility's large launch bays disguised as smokestacks. The design was submitted to party leadership as a proposal for use in vanguard forces for the invasion of the contiguous United States. The improved bot was accepted, with additional funding provided for further covert field testing in Appalachia and the establishment of an automated factory at Fujiniya. They were deployed by air across the United States, but the Great War broke out before any invasion occurred. After the Great War, the Enclave seized control of the facility, eliminated the holdouts, and secured the technology. President Thomas Eckhart later deliberately unleashed them on Appalachia, in an attempt to trick the DEFCON system into raising the alert status. By 2102, many Liberators continued to function across Appalachia. They were used to spread Chinese propaganda, which can be looted from their inventories,  and broadcast motivational phrases. The short exclamations uttered by Liberators are in Mandarin and difficult to understand due to the high degree of audio distortion. Many of them are motivational, like \"we must not stop,\" or \"revolution is a must.\" These robots were designed to be dropped from aircraft, after which, they would autonomously attack any non-Chinese units they found, using rudimentary onboard weapons and IFF modules. The Liberator shell is optimized for air delivery and protects its internals from damage. Liberators are designed to operate in swarms, networked together. They ping each other whenever they see something interesting leaving a small security loophole. This security loophole can be exploited by engineers familiar with Chinese technology to track down different pieces of Chinese tech. A Liberator is shaped like an artillery shell, with four panels around the sides that can be extended outward from the main body and used as legs for movement. The top end of the Liberator conceals four blades that allow it to perform slashing attacks or glide short distances, crashing into its targets. The Liberator chassis is painted two tones of blue with a red star-emblazoned around the machine's eye. The body is labeled \"醉龍尖\" meaning \"drunken dragon point,\" a reference to the machines' erratic flying attack and extendable hidden spike.\n\nIts eye is capable of firing a weak laser and it often vocalizes in Chinese when attacking. A Liberator can also fly into the air and pull its legs in, lunging at an enemy to attack with its central spike and the spinning blades hidden in its chassis. Liberators are fragile enemies that pose little threat. However, they are small and fast, which makes them stealthy and hard to target. They can attack at range with their laser or close in on a target, jump up and slice with the blades concealed in their chassis. Their short height makes it easier for them to evade detection, though they cannot attack enemies that are behind even moderately sized obstacles. Liberators are usually encountered in groups. In some locations like the Fujiniya Intelligence Base, they can lie in a dormant state to appear as though they are deactivated to ambush unsuspecting targets and catch them off guard.",

There are at least two entrances, one by a hatch slightly northeast from the Whitespring lookout, and another cave entrance due southeast of Summersville in the Forest. The most notorious area is centered around a building within a massive cavern, surrounded by the same liquid found in fissure sites. Called the Motherlode Acquisition Facility, the structure is occupied by Communist infiltrators, possibly members of the People's Liberation Army, who use the site as the central hub for their Motherlode operations. Upon entering the cave, there are cave crickets along the narrow passages leading down to a body of toxic water. At the end of the water is the body of James Addison, a diver with the holotape President's eyes ONLY. One must swim across and down under the water's surface to the other side of the cave, upon which a set of passageways leads to brightly colored flora including fever blossoms, kaleidopore, and starlight creeper bushes. Small pieces of material fall from the ceiling, and in the middle of the flora chamber is the body of a creature.\n\nFurther inside the tunnels, there is a small opening allowing one to see the Motherlode Acquisition Facility of the communist soldiers.

            "content": "Atlantic City is a seaside city in the former state of New Jersey. It is located east of Appalachia. Incorporated in 1854, Atlantic City was known before the Great War for its immense boardwalk and the Casino Quarter, a recreational and entertainment district stretching on a narrow strip of land sandwiched between the Pine Barrens and the Atlantic Ocean. Its last pre-War mayor was Carly Day, a career politician who set up the city hall so that professionals handled all of the municipal affairs, leaving her as an idle figurehead enjoying her free time, riding the mediocrity gradient to a cushy retirement.  It remained a popular tourist destination up into the Great War, with legalized gambling leading to the emergence of numerous casinos and other tourist attractions, such as the Aquarium of the Atlantic, drawing in visitors from the wartime United States. The city heavily invested in automation in its more affluent regions, with the Casino Quarter featuring ranks of RobCo Protectrons used as law enforcement and drivers for delivery trucks, public busses, monorails, and more. When the Great War struck, the city was spared a direct impact. Instead, it suffered severe flooding in the wake of the detonations, with floodwaters rushing into the city at high speeds, destroying everything in their path. The devastation was significant, further worsened by shipping vessels smashed by the waves into the coastal regions of the city.  When the waters settled, they reached up as far as the second floor, particularly in the ruined city center. By a stroke of luck, the Casino Quarter located deeper inland was spared and remained dry. By a stroke of luck, the Casino Quarter located deeper inland was spared and remained dry. She went through the motions, instituting rationing of food stockpiled in the city, but was incapable of organizing any large-scale relief effort without access to her staff. Those who remained did their best, but were unable to salvage the situation and Day found herself relying increasingly on the mob controlling the Casino Quarter. By February 2078, shortages were apparent, and the rations finally ran dry in May 2078, with Day accepting the mob's offer to strongarm farms on the outskirts to provide food for the city. Starvation started to set in and even Day's secretary started to warn her of the consequences. Mayor Day had nothing to offer but words of encouragement and propaganda, isolated from city affairs and the deteriorating situation on the streets. Her staff either died off or resigned, but Day failed to act, even when her own secretary begged her for scraps to make sure he could take care of his daughter. The situation in the city continued to deteriorate over the next several years, until the mob finally targeted Timothy Lane's farm. Unaware of the situation in the city, Timothy and his wife, Frieda, managed to restart agriculture and purify the soil of nuclear fallout, but were unaware of just how bad the situation was. After dispatching the raiding team,  Timothy marched on the city hall, witnessing starvation, lack of water, and a blacked-out city deprived of electricity, with the mafia and the Showmen running rampant. The people were on the verge of rioting and taking Day out themselves, and Lane met no resistance as he delivered his ultimatum and took power. The official version was that Day transferred power to him and fled the city. Together with other like-minded citizens, Lane and his wife reorganized the municipal government to bring some semblance of order to Atlantic City over the next twenty years.  Frieda's know-how about purifying soil to sustain crops was instrumental. The Munis, as the Showmen and the Family call them, took on all the government responsibilities, including keeping the power flowing, the water clean, firefighting, medical care, and perimeter defense. They delegated keeping the peace, gambling, and managing the flow of alcohol, drugs, and other chemical entertainment including keeping the power flowing, the water clean, firefighting, medical care, and perimeter defense. They delegated keeping the peace, gambling, and managing the flow of alcohol, drugs, and other chemical entertainment The unholy alliance is a pragmatic decision by Lane, as he and his wife decided that Atlantic City wasn't, isn't, and won't be heaven. As such, they opted to make it a piece of civilized hell, where the rich grow fat and vices are commonplace, but the worst excesses are curbed and everyone has food, water, electricity, and security. The Munis levy taxes to bankroll municipal operations and maintain trade routes. While both the mafia and the Showmen try to weasel out of paying them all the time, they ultimately pay, coerced by the all-powerful IRS under Buttercup.

The only major threat to threaten the City in recent years is the sudden increase in the number of Overgrown.

            "content": "Forming around 2085, with Atlantic City collapsing under the weight of Carly Day's incompetent leadership, the Showmen were created by Mother Charlotte to provide a safe haven for artists and performers after the social structures of the Old World collapsed. With the need for entertainment at an all-time low, she kept the craft alive by creating a family of performers, all unconditionally supporting and protecting each other, all to ensure that the show goes on, even past the end of the world. Over the next 20 years, the Showmen became an eclectic gathering of artists, innovators, entrepreneurs, and philosophers united by their common identity. It grew far beyond what Charlotte had imagined, becoming a part of the Atlantic City triad alongside the mob and the Munis. They provide what could be called the \"spirit\" of Acee, filling the Showman's Pier, their seat of power, with things that keep the imagination working and the sparkle in the eyes of the people present. This includes games, gambling, performances, and everything else that keeps humanity's soul alive. This does not necessarily mean keeping humans alive. Thanks to Charlotte's favored son, Veracio Cruz, the Showmen have started the Most Sensational Game, a gladiatorial arena making extensive use of the Aquarium of the Atlantic, where people face death every day in order to learn the true limits of themselves. Contestants battle each other, free from what Charlotte describes as the shackles of the pre-War world that prevented those who wished to test their martial skill in a duel to the death. Mother Charlotte is the leader of the organization, though relations are not based on a strict hierarchy, but familial ties. Charlotte leads them as a mother does children, and many genuinely see her as a mother figure, as she helped them deal with loss: Of parents, livelihood, or the basic will to live. Charlotte teaches her children confidence, which enables opportunities and making the most of them. She does not support arrogance, which leads to hubris and makes the most shining star into the most drab and uninteresting spot of light. She also balks at suggestions of insanity, believing them to be mere boxes people use for sorting and looking down on people. All Showmen have a flair for the fantastic and extraordinary, deliberately departing from the tedium of the social contract to shock others and perhaps inspire them to reach beyond the mundane and the humdrum of their daily lives. Sometimes, the inspiration can go a little too far, as the same flair makes their shows incredibly bombastic and potentially deadly to the audience. Regardless, they remain a popular attraction in Atlantic City, making the Atlantic City Boardwalk their seat of power, where sequins and stripes aren't out of the ordinary, but just a part of the local aesthetic (along with the unhinged aura). Perhaps the most esoteric of Acee factions, the Showmen root their practices in a set of core beliefs. The most basic one is that everyone has a potential they can unlock, if they so choose. Charlotte's teachings reject outside factors such as motivation or muses, trying to predict success and engineer it with the right routines, yet never once straying outside one's box, or entrusting random chance. Veracio's creation of the game embodies the way the Showmen believe one can discover their true potential: Facing death in no holds barred combat, where the greatest challenges to one's strength and willpower push participants to their limits, consciously subjecting themselves to their test to uncover their potential. The victors of the tournament have the right to bear the title of Sensation, focusing their ambition. The Showmen are respected and even feared for their devil-may-care attitude and stunts, which also render them incredibly dangerous (Sal Sticky Fingers compares them to a pack of starved, rabid hyenas, which isn't far from the truth insofar danger is concerned). However, their daring is extremely risky and, as they have limited stocks of medicine, they are reliant on the Munis to keep themselves alive through supplies or medics on loan. The Showmen also purchase the Devil's Blood from the Lombardi Family, in order to use it to unlock their \"true potential.\"",

            "content": "The Devil's Blood is a local specialty of Atlantic City, and is not well known outside of the city, as it is only meant for the \"high rollers.\" Jack Hunter describes his encounter with the Devil's Blood as one hit resulting in a \"horrifyingly glorious\" trip, creating the feeling of reaching out for a life that had been kept from him, but not quite grasping it. This created a sense of near-immediate addiction, that not even addictol could cure, and that \"maybe nothing [would].\" Hunter saw his experience with the Devil's Blood as a rebellious spoiling of the chem's exclusivity. The Devil's Blood is a narcotic with an extraordinary chemical makeup that is similar to an opioid at a glance. However, it combines the qualities of both a stimulant and a depressant, resulting in a combination of euphoria and mental stimulation, while simultaneously relaxing the body. It is also incredibly addictive, regardless of the ability of the user.  Upon consumption, the Blood directly stimulates the ventromedial prefrontal cortex of the brain (functionally the pleasure center of the brain), triggering an overwhelming sensation of pleasure. Even a single dose is enough to create a strong desire to use the substance, leading to reliance in short order. Continued use of the Blood eventually degrades mental faculties, resulting in hallucinations, fatigue, and migraines.  Eventually, even basic spelling ability degrades, turning the user into a habitual victim. However, the high remains known as a stuff of legends and reserved for the most affluent clientele of the Casino Quarter. Those who can afford it are said to \"dance with the devil\".  The Showmen also take the drug in order to unlock their \"true potential,\" or so Mother Charlotte claims. While the idea of the drug being actually siphoned from someone's blood is considered ridiculous and just a marketing move, it's actually closer to the truth than many would prefer to believe. It is obtained from the blood of a Jersey Devil hunted down by Antonio Russo years earlier, accidentally discovered by his affiliated chemist. They came up with a way to synthesize the drug, which was still prohibitively expensive, but readily available, becoming a major source of wealth for the post-War Lombardi Family.",

            "comment": "The Lombardi Family",
            "constant": false,
            "content": "The Lombardi Family originates from the pre-War mafia, though it is distinct in that it was founded in the 21st century, by Quentino and Concerta Lombardi, immigrants from Italy. Rallying locals from the neighborhood, Quentino established a crime family with the traditional, Italian-only policy of admission. The mobsters were not aware of the role Concerta played, as she stayed in her brother's shadow, whispering in his ear to get him to do what she wanted, slowly building up the Lombardi might. Quentino was impulsive and temperamental, motivated primarily, if not purely, by vice and whim. Concerta became the level-headed, decisive tactician as a matter of necessity, to avoid being sentenced to begging for scraps on the street. Thanks to her efforts, the Lombardis became a significant presence in the city before the Great War, and the mob's position strengthened in the wake of the Great War and flooding due to Carly Day's ineptitude. The mayor lost a majority of her staff to the war and subsequent developments, leaving her unable to secure an adequate food supply and simply burning through the stockpiled rations. By February 2078, the supply was already thinned out and the mob started to assert its position against Day, openly refusing to pay taxes. When the taxes ran out, the situation changed to the mafia's benefit. With most of her staff dead or resigned, she gave the mob free reign to pressure farms on the outskirts of Atlantic City to provide food for the city. She was effectively setting them loose, against the better judgment of her peers. Self-interested mafiosos became little more than raiders with style, preying on the farmers for years as they left the city to fend for itself, caring only about themselves and the odd rich trader who perused the Casino Quarter, spared devastation during the floods. The situation lasted into February 2085, when a raiding party entered Timothy Lane's farm, only to be met with shotgun shells. This turn of events left the mafia unable to respond as the Lanes marched on city hall and removed Carly Day from power, reorganizing the Atlantic City Municipal Government. The Family, as it was now known, despised this interference and Timothy Lane. However, the worst they could really do was come up with a seemingly derogatory nickname for the government, Munis, as the Lanes moved quickly to restore food supply, set up water purification, reactivate generators to provide power, and provide all the necessities citizens task their governments with doing. Lane escaped forward, and their indispensable role in making the city habitable and welcoming to travelers and traders ensured the desire for retaliation waned. Lane opted for collaboration, rather than suppression. Realizing that Atlantic City was, is, and likely will remain a city of vice, he entered an alliance of convenience with the mafia. While the Munis take care of running the city, including services and EMS, the mob will be free to operate as it sees fit regarding vices, and the Showmen will be given free reign as to entertainment. In return, they will pay taxes to sustain city operations. The alliance formed the foundation of AC's success, despite griping and competition between the three factions. The mob especially tries to get out of paying taxes, but the IRS and Buttercup usually resolve the situation with ease. The civilized hell of Acee continues to survive and even thrive. The Family is also preoccupied with internal power struggles and banking on the discovery of the Devil's Blood by Antonio Russo. The two issues are related, as Russo was the protege of Don Quentino Lombardi, head of the Acee mob, and his discovery and defeat of the Jersey Devil and its blood allowed the mob to create an incredibly addictive narcotic, sold at a high price only to the most affluent of high rollers coming into Atlantic City. Russo and Gene created a formula mimicking the original's effects and allowing for the use of synthetic materials for production, which made it more affordable to produce, but no less expensive. Russo made everyone in the Acee mob rich and was slated to succeed Don Quentino as godfather, if it wasn't for his sister Concerta. When the Don passed, his sister ensured only she and Antonio knew about the fact. Posing as the middlewoman between her brother and the mobsters, she marked Russo for death. Antonio fled Atlantic City with his family, setting up a nightclub in Appalachia, faking senility. Beyond competition for power, the situation has started to deteriorate in general, with many changes occurring within the organization. Called \"desperate times\", it seems to have warranted cooking the books to reduce the amount of dues going to the other factions far beyond the expected, reasonable level of cheating. This is an unprecedented change in Lombardi policy, in fact, and risks open war. Like other mob organizations, the Acee Family is a strictly hierarchical, autocratic organization subordinated entirely to the godfather, with a mean nepotism streak. Don Quentino Lombardi was the godfather before the Great War and survived the nuclear holocaust in one piece, with his sister keeping the mob focused on maintaining its power and influence (which included loosening admission standards and letting non-Italians join).  Below the godfather are the capos (short for Caporegime, usually translated as captain), responsible for various aspects of the family's operations, commanding mafia soldiers, the lowest ranks. Caporegimes are typically Italian, in keeping with tradition.  Antonio Russo, Quentino's protege, was responsible for drug manufacturing and distribution, for example The Don intended for Russo to succeed him ahead of his sister, as the Acee Family follows the misogynistic traditions of the mafia and excludes women from succession. The disenfranchised Concerta failed to convince her brother to break with the traditions brought over from Naples, though she remains determined to become the mob's first godmother. She worked around these traditions by maintaining that her brother is alive, just infirm, and acting as his spokesperson - in reality easing into the role of leader and preparing to break with the conservativism of the mob. The conservativism extends to casual conversation and more than once have mobsters come to blow over the honor of their mothers. The absence of the Don is slowly but surely straining the family's unity, and the emerging competition for power is causing hastier and less thought-out decisions that risk tearing apart the peace deal at the heart of Acee. Most of the mob's operations are concentrated at The Neapolitan Casino and Quentino's Night Club, itself a mafia safehouse and headquarters dating back to the pre-War times. As the locations are prime hunting grounds for anyone seeking to exploit high rollers, treachery and backroom deals are common. Sal Sticky Fingers is a prime example, as he is constantly trying to come up with a scheme to get rich and gain the respect of his peers, which usually backfires. He has learned to keep them under wraps and the others ignorant to ensure that nobody interferes or punishes him. One of the three major factions in Atlantic City, the Family is cooperating with the Munis, though not without a significant amount of griping and attempts at tax evasion. While most look down on the Munis, there are secret admirers among the mobsters, who realize that the Munis are essential to their success and continued operations. Most are afraid to speak openly, however.  As part of their duties as the equivalent of pre-War police, the Family actually does police drunken civvies, street thugs, and other miscreants, though they tend to show preferential treatment towards their own people and turn a blind eye to their misdemeanors.",

This group is a re-establishment of one of the original raider gangs of Appalachia, after the original groups were nearly killed off. The group consists primarily of the Diehards. After these Raiders (composed of survivors of the original groups who fled Appalachia and new members picked up along the way) caught wind that people were returning to the land they once claimed for themselves, they and their leader Meg Groberg decided to come back and put a stop to anyone who would take their territory. In their travels they made their way from Appalachia to the Commonwealth and Washington, D.C. They set up a formidable base of operations at the crashed space station, which they renamed the Crater. It is inevitable that outsiders who drop by unannounced will not receive a warm welcome. The Blood Eagles, another raider gang unrelated to the Crater faction, also entered Appalachia at the same time, leading to tense interactions between their members. Their violence and sadism has led to their being declared monsters by many of the Crater Raiders. Other groups of recent raider arrivals include the Free Radicals, Edwin's gang, and Sargento's gang.",

            "constant": false,
            "content": "The Great War, and simply referred to as The War, was a global thermonuclear war that took place on Saturday, October 23, 2077, caused by the Sino-American War. It resulted in the destruction of all participating nations and abroad, global disruption of the climate and billions of casualties as a result of nuclear blasts, exposure to radiation and the subsequent collapse of social and government structures, all within the span of just two hours. The United States of America and the rest of the world were transformed into a wasteland. Even 200 years later, the consequences of the Great War can still be felt in the form of lingering radiation, diseases, mutated monsters, environmental degradation, and scarce resources resulting in violent lawlessness. The nuclear holocaust was a direct result of the decade-long conflict that left both the United States and China exhausted. By 2077, a combination of attrition, loss of supply routes, and offensives conducted by the United States across the front left Chinese units in Alaska stranded and cut off from reinforcements. The liberation of Anchorage spearheaded by winterized T-51 power armor units under the command of General Constantine Chase marked the end of the Battle of Anchorage, after a decade of war. The campaign in mainland China, which began in 2074 and included deployments in Shantou,  was reinvigorated by gaining ground in Alaska and the deployment of T-51 units. However, as American soldiers pushed deeper into the mainland, Chinese resistance increased. By October, the situation transitioned from a rout into a stalemate. Despite a decade of war, there was no end in sight. Billions of dollars and thousands of casualties were spent in vain, despite taxes and various wartime revenues ensuring the federal government was able to fund a standing army the likes of which the United States had never seen before. In a desperate attempt to bolster the offensive and break the stalemate, bases across the United States were sealed and troops were redeployed. The situation was made worse by the fact that the oligarchs ruling the United States retreated to remote locations around the globe, expecting a last-ditch nuclear strike from China at any moment. The oil rig off the Californian coast was claimed by the president and key members of the junta, a group which would later become the foundation of the Enclave. The United States was leaderless, continuing on simply due to inertia. In 2065, Robert House arrived at the conclusion that a nuclear war was inevitable by 2080 or sooner. By 2077, Vault-Tec had begun stating the likelihood of nuclear war occurring by the year 2080 had been calculated to be the staggering odds of 17,443,762 to 1. The corporation had been scheming with other entities such as RobCo and Big MT to finance their Vaults and firmly establish a monopoly. To this end, they offered to initiate a nuclear blast to kick off the Great War so as to ensure their investment would pay off, and eventually their experiments and individuals within the vaults would be able to take control of the surface, though it is not known if they ever had the chance to follow through on such a provocation. The war both began and ended on Saturday, October 23, 2077. Unknown submersible objects were sighted at 00:03 EST off the coast of California by the United States Pacific Fleet. At 03:37 EST, a squadron of high-altitude bombers were sighted off the Bering Strait and believed to be Chinese. At least one Chinese stealth submarine, the Yangtze, moved close to the American East Coast, launching all warheads, save for one, due to a malfunction. Six hours later, at 09:13 EST, the Integrated Operational Nuclear Detection System detected the first four missile launches and the United States went to DEFCON 2. Four minutes later, NORAD confirmation sealed the fate of the world. At 09:26 EST, the president ordered a retaliatory strike according to scenario MX-CN91. Nuclear bombs hit Pennsylvania and New York at 09:42 EST, followed by the west coast immediately after. The bombs continued to drop and five minutes later, at 09:47 EST, Washington D.C. was hit and most American facilities went offline. The nuclear exchange continued for two hours. Both China and the United States suffered catastrophic losses. The standard nuclear warhead used in the Great War was that of a strategic nuclear warhead ranging from 200-750 kilotons in explosive yield with high-yield variants found on Chinese submarines. This was actually far worse for the Earth, as the lower yield warheads deposited more soil and debris into the lower atmosphere, resulting in a much more concentrated fallout that eventually enveloped the planet. The entire world was blanketed with multiple nuclear strikes, and the world and its entire ecosystem were irrevocably changed for centuries to come.",

            "constant": false,
            "content": "Big MT was a think tank and one of the defense contractors in the employ of the United States during the Sino-American War. Its headquarters was the Big Mountain Research Facility. Big MT was responsible for the most breathtaking research endeavors back before the War. Endeavors that, at the same time, often violated basic human rights or were sometimes sold to the highest bidder for cold hard cash. As unethical as their operations could be, their achievements were nevertheless groundbreaking. Despite that fact, they never reached widespread deployment due to issues with cost, efficiency or simply greater influence of certain parties such as the other defense contractors West Tek, RobCo Industries, and General Atomics International.\n\nAs a think tank, delving into the theoretical was as natural as breathing. Usually, this resulted in mere hypotheses becoming reality. One example of which was Doctor Mobius' analytical hypothesis of post-holocaust economic systems. This extensive work was completely accurate in predicting that the humble bottle cap would become a currency.  Such brilliance and madness would come back to haunt the facility, as exemplified by Gabe, Little Yangtze, their trauma harnesses, bioengineering projects, total pacification collars, and the lobotomites. However, this research led to fields that could only truly be described as \"Super Science.\"\n\nBig MT's true purpose was the caring for and keeping of any scientific discovery, leaving its discoveries safe until they were needed to help others. Its laboratories and science intended as a place to build the future of all mankind. Their attempt into the heavy construction industry, however, was not a success. Hexcrete (named for its shape) was supposed to be a more simplified mass-production method for large uniform special-blend concrete blocks. The remains of this production method are called the X-66 Hexcrete archipelago, which has since been dominating the southwestern corner of Big MT.\n\nWhen customers would come to the think tank for their services, they would create specialized technology for them. However, if their town or city was just right, they would use it as a controlled experiment. Only on occasion, Big MT had to get permission in order to secure financial assistance for the technology they were developing. Alternatively, the company used detained communists to populate their own mock cities. However, it was not enough: they needed even more laboratory space and tested their experiments on unsuspecting Americans and letting them progress in isolated small towns while Big MT observed. Their partnership with Vault-Tec was in the context of outsourcing laboratory space. Big MT needed \"test cities\" to test in real-time their products in (relatively) controlled environments. Knowing the Vault-Tec was better at it than them, they together conducted experiments with Vault 22, sending the botanists the Beauveria mordicana fungus, among other supplies. Despite fantastic funding, Big MT was forced to adapt due to budget cuts. In the case of Project: Burke, grave robbing became institutionalized and commonplace in order to acquire human bodies upon which to test their experiments, although it was rumored that the staff used the bodies for other purposes. Another project, Project: Hare was only described as liquidation operations against non-military targets to procure research subjects, another desperate move from budget cuts. They denied the latter completely, finding the insinuation insulting to the point of not responding. Originally, the center was named for the mountain above the research center. The construction of their headquarters was designed for the utmost secrecy, being built completely underneath Big Mountain in the Southwest Commonwealth. Each facility was specifically constructed for their various fields of science. Supplied by rail, via the original entrances to the facility. The rail lines of the facility only ran from north to east and north to west (and vice versa), with their only stop inside the facility being the loading station. However, due to a failed experiment Klein conducted in the Y-0 research center, the mountain above the center was vaporized, leaving behind a giant crater and the exposed facility. This catastrophe did little to phase the researchers, and the efforts in pushing the boundaries of science continued unabated.  Despite the original mountain of the facility lost, Big MT was still expanding, with a new facility under construction. A radar fence was also constructed for security purposes.\n\nThe lack of official test environments led to them winding up their experiments and letting them loose on an isolated population who neither knew what they were nor what was happening, resulting in the experiments eventually killing all involved and destroying the settlements. Some test cities used were the Sierra Madre and Hopeville, testing the Cloud and the experimental hazmat suit in the former, and the weather control in the latter, with the Y-17 Mark IX Auto-Doc as a constant between the two locations. Developing weaponry appeared to be a sizable portion of their business model. While they delved into new territory with conventional weapons designs, e.g. the K9000 and FIDO models of cyborganic weaponry, Big MT also developed new designs for energy weapons, such as laser-assisted electrical rifles and proton axes. The company even made weapons by mistake, namely a sonic emitter that was originally intended for therapeutic use that turned out to be capable of destroying robots and power armor, with varying effects based on the sonic module inserted (from knocking back the target, to paralysis, to dismemberment, to explosion and incendiary depending on the load-out).\n\nNot only did Big MT focus on infantry weapons, Saturnite was also forged in the company's facilities. While cosmic knives were an adequate use for Saturnite, artillery shells were eventually made out this incredibly durable metal to obliterate even the strongest fortifications. Poison and corrosive gas, namely what would come to be known as \"The Cloud\" was also produced by Big MT at the Z-43 innovative toxins plant, and tested at the Hazmat testing ground, where they also conducted experiments for their prototype hazmat suit and matching cowl.\n\nNot satisfied at producing only weapons, they decided to improve upon the stealth technology already employed by the world's militaries. Based off of the Chinese stealth armor, Big MT developed a wholly American version, their stealth suit Mk I which eventually became more complex. The Mk II including advanced software was not just able to automatically fit the user, it would enhance the user's movement in virtually every way possible. This, of course, is not all it could do, as its onboard personality would remind the operator of events around them to automatically injecting Med-X and stimpaks. Numerous advances were made with offensive robotics as well. Advances were made in animal sciences, but for what purpose other than curiosity, no one is sure. Cazadores were developed from tarantula hawk wasps, and night stalkers were even made on a dare, using the genetic material of coyotes and rattlesnakes. Big MT teams at the X-8 research center were successful in melding animal and machine and created cyberdogs for use by police and military forces. They also had improved upon the designs of General Atomics International's robobrains and created their own series of robobrains. Bioengineers took it even further by creating think tanks, robots similar to robobrains in that they use a biological brain for their processor, but think tanks retain the personality of their brain and are truly intelligent, rather than artificially.\n\nThe X-13 research facility also created the psychoanalytic cardiac-dampening stealth suit that interacts and supplements the wearer's own abilities, improving their reactions, manual dexterity and speed while sneaking.\n\nAnother innovation was the development of the Implant Y-7, which had been proven to increase performance while reducing weight in lab animals. Although it had never been run through any human test trials, its inventor Doctor Calis, decided to give it to Technician Slough to address their productivity, which had taken a dive coincided with a marked weight gain over the previous few months. Delving into cryoscience, Big MT developed chambers to preserve human life in a state of inactivity, known as hibernation chambers. Big MT was in the field of cybernetics, creating improvements in the Cyberhound models, custom implants, and cyborgs. With their specialized versions being developed for both the military and police departments. Their research into this field included the dogs being able to \"sniff out\" communism. Although they weren't going to tell the subjects about the dogs that were involved in the testing, they created the Residential Cyberdog Test to test cyberdogs with untrained human interaction. However, this was not all that their cybernetics endeavors achieved. One of their creations was a weapon using a dog brain to track targets, literally sniffing out friendly and foe alike. Big MT reached groundbreaking achievements in the field of holography. After perfecting the stationary hologram projectors, like the interface of matter replicators, they moved on to even more impressive holograms. Not just mere projections, these solid energy masses spearheaded into human-machine interaction, not least the medical industry. An entire laboratory was dedicated to researching the dynamics of light waves and creating lifelike interfaces, vendors, and sentries. Even more astonishing than tangible light were the experiments to hone in on if light waves could accelerate natural healing processes. They were successful and it resulted in valence radii-accentuators and atomic-valence tri-radii-oscillators, bands of light that suspend themselves over one's head. Dedicating an entire facility to the medical industry, Y-17 was where Big MT made their upgrades to the Auto-Doc family, specifically the Mark IX. The Mark IX was not the only Auto-Doc developed at Big MT, and another was specially created to house a artificial personality. Not content to only improve upon the Auto-Doc side of the autonomous medical industry, they also created the entire line of Mister Orderly robots, a niche model in the Mister Handy market.\n\nCreating medical devices did not end as intended, however. For example, the sonic emitter was designed to be a therapeutic vertebral desensitizer but was far more useful as a multiplatform weapon. The Y-17 trauma override harness was also produced: this suit was designed to autonomously carry wounded (or dead) soldiers to a field medical center. However, if the suit was left without a designated home base it would continue to wander in an endless random state. Furthermore, its artificial muscle and fibers would take on the function of their housed occupant, namely combat.\n\nAll this pales to compare with the advances in light technology. Valence radii-accentuators and tri-radii oscillators for example, are capable of boosting the body's metabolism, increasing its regeneration rate and endurance. Another example was using certain wavelengths of light to enhance cognitive processes and mood. Saturnite is a space-age, metallic-ceramic alloy developed for use in a variety of fields, from construction, to cookware, to the arms industry (superior power fists and knives to armor plating ), from their in-house research facility.\n\nThe actual composition of Saturnite is never revealed, though it has many unique characteristics similar to other real-life polymers. In the form of unprocessed ingots, Saturnite appears a dull bluish-grey, but is silvery-white when refined, and turns a grungy, rusty brown color when exposed to The Cloud (some Saturnite products have vibrant teal colors, but this is simply paint). Saturnite is lightweight but very tough and sturdy, even able to completely resist small-arms fire when used as armor plating, and can be easily molded into different shapes. As a blade, it can be made incredibly sharp, to the point where it is almost impractical, able to slice off fingers and break cutting boards with little effort if one is not careful. Aside from being able to hold an edge, Saturnite can also retain high heat for an extremely long time, and can hold its shape even when heated to a red-hot glow (though it does lose some of its durability). Big MT even went as far as actively manipulating the weather. Small scale tests were conducted within their in-house controlled environment at the X-17 meteorological station; tests were eventually scaled up and used Hopeville as a test town, regardless of its residents. Whatever happened there ended in a disaster, spawning the dust storms for which the Divide is known. Delving into the field of robotics, Big MT created entire lines of improved versions of the common mass-produced models, namely the Protectron, Robobrain, Mister Gutsy, and sentry bot. One model they attempted to improve upon but could not were RobCo Industries Securitrons, even dedicating an entire facility to their de-construction and reverse engineering. Their only success on the design was a tiny janitor bot that could only collect and clean dishes.\n\nThey did not stop at improving proven models of robots and created the robo-scorpion, development upon a pre-War military project, recreated and improved by Doctor Mobius from the X-42 robo-warfare facility. While the prototypical walking eye robots are a less impressive feat, the spider-like robot remained useful for surveillance and espionage. Most of Big MT's achievements would have been nothing without advanced programs and networks. A poignant example is their line of Mister Orderlies: without advanced medical programs in virtually every field of medicine, the robots are nothing more than repainted Mister Handies. Big MT also endeavored to create artificial personalities of all sorts, with Dr. Mobius dedicating an entire lab (within his living space, no less) to provide each appliance in the lab their very own personality. Furthermore, even their prototype stealth suit has its own personality.\n\nAlmost no field of research that Big MT dove into went without advanced software they had created themselves, regardless if it was their vast array of specialized robotic upgrades, or original robot platforms like the robo-scorpion, or the miniature robots that stock the Sink's store. Their most outlandish and criminal projects, like their vending machine, their weather dominator, and their total pacification collar (or its big brother, the \"pacification field\") especially needed unique software. The company also delved into virtual reality simulations, although the simulator was eventually destroyed by an employee due to the simulations leading to the death of countless researchers.",

            "content": "RobCo IndustriesTM was a multibillion-dollar robotics and software corporation founded by industrialist and technologist Robert House. It quickly became one of the largest and most influential computer and robotics corporations in the pre-War United States. Several RobCo products were the de facto choice for many consumers, such as the Unified Operating System used by nearly all terminals. The company's key products were robots, selling them to both the average American and producing them for the United States military through defense contracts. The production of robots would accelerate into the Automation riots, with RobCo's robots facilitating the massive loss of jobs to automation and further displacing working-class Americans before the Great War. Founded on June 25, 2042 by Robert House on his 22nd birthday, RobCo quickly soared through the ranks of the world’s most profitable and powerful corporations, rivaling the likes of Poseidon Energy within several years. By 2077, RobCo’s patented software and robotics designs had become a cornerstone of American industry, as exemplified by the widespread use of RobCo’s Unified Operating System in most American computer systems in the years leading up to the Great War. Robert House founded the company after he was cheated out of his inheritance by his brother. By 2047, thanks to his business acumen, technical genius, and a Commonwealth Institute of Technology degree, it was one of the most profitable corporations on Earth.  Its rise was aided by a Byzantine internal structure: The 27 year old House deliberately structured the company like a maze, to obfuscate his role and allow RobCo to effectively hide their practices. The company's aggressive expansion policies coupled with the high quality of their products have given it a practical monopoly in crucial segments of the software market. By 2075, their Unified Operating System, MF Boot Agent, and RETROS BIOS were the de facto industry standard for terminals and mainframes across the 13 Commonwealths. Within a year, their RobcOS became the standard for military-grade security systems as well. Their broad range of robots, including the eyebot, protectron, and sentry bot lines were one of the most common types of robotics before the War, rivaled only by General Atomics International's own product lines. In certain fields, however, RobCo was unmatched. One of those was Robert Mayflower's Stealth Boy, reverse engineered sometime between 2066 and 2077 from captured Chinese technology. Of course, the company was concerned about its public image: A sinister megacorporation does not inspire confidence or loyalty. To educate the public and make it friendlier to the American consumer, RobCo invested in exhibits and intense public relations campaigns, like the joint RobCo/General Atomics exposition at the Museum of Technology. The company was known to acquire valuable assets through any means necessary. One such asset was REPCONN Aerospace. RobCo acquired the company after a year of buying shares from 2075 to 2076, when Steeple's allies turned against him. The Vice President tried to rally the board again and sought help from Masters, but while the CFO officially agreed to support him, she was actually working with General Manager Piers Isley to sell the company. Citing the profit of a merger with RobCo (not to mention avoiding a hostile takeover and a much less amicable transition), Isley and Masters managed to undermine Steeple's position in the company and get the board of directors to pass a vote of no confidence against Steeple, after he refused to even consider selling his part of the company, in order to maintain their independence and integrity. Failing the vote, Steeple stepped down from his position as Vice President. Carl Rook, transferred from RobCo's security division, became the next Vice President, focusing on improving the security within the company.  Robert House, CEO of RobCo, used the newly acquired company for a weapons research program for Colonel Moretti of the US military, repurposing REPCONN's proprietary plasma rocket propulsion system. H&H Tools factory, the inheritance Anthony House stole from Robert, saw aggressive trading practices at the hands of RobCo, in attempt to obtain their market share. RobCo also had the good fortune of forming lasting partnerships with other corporations. In fact, the joint venture with Vault-Tec, in which RobCo's Pip-Boy 2000 and Pip-Boy 3000 were selected as the personal information processors for Vault dwellers, was widely considered one of the most successful joint ventures in the history of American commerce and industry. A number of vaults were built throughout the Mojave Desert, though only one is known of.  In addition, RobCo also assisted in Vault 79's construction, adding military-grade defensive turret systems to the Vault. The turret system was developed at the RobCo Research Center, known as the Semi-Autonomous Immobile Weapon Platform, to be used only for special government procurement. Another venture made was with that of the Nuka-Cola Corporation and their Nuka-World amusement park, opening the RobCo Battlezone as part of the grand opening of the Galactic Zone.\n\nYet another venture was made with the company Arktos Pharma and three other unknown corporations to secure a contract with the United States Space Administration for the Deep Sleep project, which was an attempt to record biological sensory data from subjects in hibernation pods in zero-gravity conditions. One of their largest ventures was with that of the Hornwright Industrial and Atomic Mining Services in order to bulldoze and take land from many residents of the Cranberry Bog, specifically Watoga National Park, and replace it with a fully automated city of the future, with the RobCo facility nearby providing them with jobs and advanced technologies. Perhaps their most prestigious joint venture was military contract 38917. In cooperation with General Atomics International, Robco was contracted to collaborate on an unprecedented joint project: The creation of the most powerful combat robot in the history of warfare, to liberate Anchorage, Alaska from Chinese occupation in a display of power meant to demoralize the enemy and force them into submission. The project was meant to serve both military and propaganda needs. The former dictated the capacity, the latter the design: In the words of General Constantine Chase, initiator of the project, Liberty Prime was to embody the American military: A walking, talking, nuke-tossing hero reminding enemies of the U.S. that they picked a fight with a global superpower. Confident that the project would soon yield result, General Chase publicly confirmed in June 2072 that the U.S. Army was working with General Atomics and RobCo to create a superweapon meant to establish dominance of the United States on the Alaskan front.",

            "content": "RobCo Industries PIP-Boy 2000 is a pre-War personal information processor from RobCo's Pip-Boy line of products, designed to provide its users with a powerful tool for organizing their life, keeping track of activities, storing data, traveling, and much, much more. Though not as advanced as later models, it remains a rare, powerful tool in the post-nuclear United States. Small by pre-War standards, the PIP-Boy 2000 is a cumbersome wrist-mounted device utilizing modern cathode ray tube monitors in green monochrome for high resolution display of its contents. The versatility and ruggedness of the design won RobCo a contract for supplying PIP devices to all Vault-Tec Industries shelter personnel and designated dwellers. Another key factor was the fact that the hardware and software of the PIP-Boy allows for dozens of functions. These include tracking the current status of the owner on any assignments they might be carrying out, generating automatic maps of the local area, recording audio and video for later playback, keeping track of important dates and events (excellent for scheduling meetings and appointments), and more. While commercial models had the Alarm Clock offered as an optional feature, all PIP-Boys manufactured for Vault-Tec had it included as standard.  Other features include cabling for external Wattz C-U motion sensors, a holodisk reader, and even the ability to play games on the latest models. Additional peripherals compatible with the PIP-Boy 2000 include the answer console  and memory enhancers designed to transfer information through an optic flash to the user's brain. These range from dictionaries and encyclopedias to more exotic lingual and medical enhancers. Of course, managing the multitude of function screens and hardware extensions was cumbersome and reduced reliability. As a result, PIP-Boys required (still do) regular maintenance to remain in working order.[1] Tellingly, RobCo issued PIP-Boys with just a three month warranty. Annual maintenance allowed Vaults to retain their PIP-Boys in good condition, but when left for extended time periods without maintenance, data contained in the PIP-Boy's memory could become corrupt, to the point of being reset to factory zero. Many Vaults that were furnished in later stages of the project (even if their construction ended early) opted for more modern models of the PIP-Boy product line, even if they were not compatible with hardware designed for the older models. However, despite these flaws, functioning PIP-Boy 2000 units remain highly sought after due to their utility and functionality.",

            "content": "General Atomics International (GAI) was a pre-War company specializing in industrial robotics, energy, weapons, and software up until the Great War. One of the most prominent industrial robotics manufacturers in the world, General Atomics was one of the first companies to introduce modern robots to the market, starting with the Mister Handy model in 2037, as a general purpose construction and maintenance unit. Used widely on both the American and Mexican markets (especially after the Mexico City earthquake of 2042), it was a rugged, reliable design, which received just one major hardware update in 2039, to eliminate a bug causing interference in the operation of the multiple arms. Although the model was vastly successful, it was still a design rooted in the technology of the 2030s, with a compact computer brain that was incapable of learning or executing complex tasks without extensive programming. By the 2070s, it was an automaton surrounded by more advanced designs utilizing cutting edge neural networks. In order to maintain their market share, General Atomics entered into a joint venture with RobCo Industries, combining its talent with General Atomics' experience in robotics. The resulting model was a sleek, elegant design capable of self-programming and initiative, more than making up for halving the number of arms to just three. Despite its sophistication, it was also cost-effective, making it the perfect domestic servant robot. The success of the joint venture resulted in the U.S. Army tapping GAI and RobCo to create Liberty Prime around 2072 and spearhead the creation of Robobrains at Robotics Technology Facility RB-2851 in Boston, Massachusetts. Beyond their robots, GAI also manufactured nuclear reactors for various purposes, such as providing backup power for Vaults (e.g. Vault 13), wave/particle diverters for laser weapons, and even experimented with autonomous, automated robot networks supposed to maintain a facility independently. However, their Director Management System proved to be a disaster,  resulting in numerous fatalities at General Atomics Galleria that forced a shutdown of the facility until firmware updates could be delivered to the affected robots. The casualties included the human supervisor who was legally required to be present on site. The fact that the corporation did not go under can be chalked up to their official policy of bribing any survivors into silence (called \"immediate financial settlement\" in corpospeak).",

            "content": "The West Tek Corporation, commonly referred to as West Tek and also known as West-Tek or West Tech, was a major United States defense contractor and research corporation, involved in strategic defense projects of the Department of Defense, such as power armor and FEV research. West Tek was founded in 2002, consisting of two divisions: Advanced Weapons and Biomedical Sciences Research.  Its early projects included the X277 magnetic rail cannon. Although powerful, the cost of fielding such a weapon on a mass scale were considered too extreme and the project was shelved in 2044. In 2055, following the emergence of the New Plague, the company focused its biomedical research efforts on developing a cure for the contagion. Although unsuccessful, it would lead to West Tek being chosen to develop a general immunity virion nearly twenty years later. In 2065, West Tek joined the power armor research initiative. Although the early prototypes proved to be unworkable in the field, they paved the way for breakthroughs in other fields, military and civilian. The key achievement of the project was the creation of the first portable fusion cell in 2066. Bolstered by this discovery, West Tek immediately began work on the ambitious T-51 power armor project. However, the invasion of Alaska by Chinese forces a few months later forced the military and participating companies to improvise and speed up their schedule. West Tek was the first to beat its competitors to the punch by developing the power armor frame  and the first practical series of power armor, the T-45 model D. The first mechanized infantry units equipped with T-45d power armor were deployed to the Alaskan front less than a year later. Although lacking in mobility, they were effective in stemming the Chinese onslaught, thanks to their ability to carry heavy ordinance into battle with ease. West Tek also developed portable, military-grade laser weapons, paving the way for industrial giants like Wattz Electronics. By 2069, it was the single largest defense contractor for the United States government. Its largest contract was the T-51 power armor,  which would not be completed for another seven years. In 2073, West Tek was contracted to develop a general immunization agent against the New Plague and biochemical weapons used by China. Their viral research efforts from 2055 onwards played a major role in the selection process. This generalized immunity virion was designated the Pan-Immunity Virion Project and formed on September 15. Early experiments with the virion resulted in effective immunity to genetic damage or disruption of protein synthesis, thanks to the new quad-helix structure created by the PVP in affected cells. However, the side effects (increase in muscle mass and induction of replication even in normally non-replicating or slow replicating cells) attracted the attention of West Tek's military liaison, Major Barnett, who immediately ordered further experiments in that direction in March, 2075. Subsequent successful experimentation on flatworms and small mammals confirmed the viability of PVP as an evolutionary mutagen, now designated the Forced Evolutionary Virus. The last attempt to continue the PVP line of experimentation was the Greenhouse Initiative, which attempted to use the mutagenic potential of PVP to create edible plants and vegetation that could greatly increase food production and combat the shortages that led to the food riots rocking the country. The town of Huntersville was selected as the test site, resulting in an economic boom. Although the company would purchase test rights from local farmers as late as December 2075, the project was at an end. On January 6, 2076, the military secured West Tek research sites in the name of national security. Among others, a military detachment under the command of Colonel Robert Spindel was deployed to The Glow, bringing it under military control. West Tek was effectively nationalized, and the development of FEV continued apace, with support from the military's own advisory teams. New genetic sequences were spliced into FEV, gradually turning it into a shifting-absorptive virus that had little in common with the original Pan-Immunity Virion. It did, however, result in increased intelligence, dexterity, muscle mass, and resiliency to pathogens and cancer. The Greenhouse Initiative was scrapped and the researchers reassigned to other projects as West Tek decided to use its Appalachian branch to focus on experimenting with FEV to determine its practical limits, with Huntersville as proving grounds for low-level FEV exposure experiments and source of test subjects. The Advanced Weapons and Laser Development divisions completed their own projects by the end of the year, resulting in the T-51 power armor being put into production after testing and further iteration by the Army Corps of Engineers at Fort Strong in mid-2076. West Tek continued iterating on the design, developing the next generation T-60 power armor, quietly tested in the following months and entering service after the Battle of Anchorage.  In January 2077, the defense contract was renewed by the government once again, heralding the value of power armor in all theaters of the war. Apart from the power armor, the FEV project was nearing completion. All Californian FEV research assets to the newly constructed Mariposa Military Base, including a significant portion of West Tek's research staff, ignoring recommendations against human testing from the personnel. In Appalachia, where human testing was already ongoing, advanced mutation experiments continued around the clock for the duration of 2077. While the Mariposa team perfected an operational strain, Appalachian researchers focused on experimental ones that would test the limits of the virus. Apart from numerous nightmare-inducting results, the experiments created stable mutations that would become known as the snallygaster  and the Grafton monster, after Thomas Eckhart unleashed them and the super mutants on Appalachia as part of his sinister plans. The Californian branch fared less well. While the Appalachian facility was abandoned and the FEV neutralized, by October 23, most of West Tek's personnel in California were dead, either executed by the mutinous soldiers during the Mariposa Rebellion or killed in the nuclear strike on the research facility north of San Diego.",

The spore plants will attack anything within its range, which despite being rooted in the ground, can be quite far with corrosive spit that it can secrete and shoot at significant speed and range. This marked the evolution of the spore plant from 2241, as prior spore plants would throw spikes at perceived threats. The use of spikes did not disappear from spore plants, however, as spikes now grow at the base of spore plants, likely to protect themselves from being uprooted. When investigating Vault 22, research scientist Keely noted that although they largely ignored her as she progressed through the vault, they were capable of contaminating her live samples. Spore plants also seem to have a symbiotic relationship with mantises, as mantises will feed some of their prey to the spore plants and allow them to grow in the proximity of their oothecae, likely to protect the still growing young mantises. But - as Keely noted - when mantises attempted to feed her to the plants, they were \"disinclined to eat ghoul meat\"; indicating a preference among the species. Keely continues to report that one of the chemicals secreted by the spore plants serves as a mild stimulant when ingested by humans. Spore plants are violent in nature and attack without provocation. They are immune to poison and radiation.",

            "content": "Arroyo is a settlement founded in 2162 by the Vault Dweller following their exile from Vault 13 by the overseer. Originally a tribal village, it would eventually rise in power after the Chosen One completed their quest and used the G.E.C.K. in 2242. In May 2162, the Vault Dweller returned to Vault 13 after defeating the Master and his army, only to be exiled by the Vault's overseer for fear of encouraging others to follow their example and leave the Vault. They wandered the desert, but never moved far from the mountains that shielded the Vault from the rest of the world. Upon hearing of what happened to them, a few other residents of the Vault decided to leave and join, following soon afterward. The Vault Dweller eventually came into contact with the small group of dwellers. They knew little of the outside world and would have likely died if it were not for the Vault Dweller's knowledge and experience. The combined group founded the town of Arroyo, its construction completed on August 18, 2167.\n\nInitially, they sent scouts back toward the Vault, but that slowly came to an end. The Vault Dweller and their spouse initially led the village, teaching the others the skills they would need to survive and grow strong, such as hunting, farming, engineering and warfare. In 2188, their daughter, who later became the Arroyo elder, was born. The tribe grew strong over the years under the Vault Dweller's leadership.\n\nOn January 16, 2208, the Vault Dweller left Arroyo. Their spouse had passed away years earlier, and they left their memoirs and jumpsuit behind. Some say they were taken by the sky spirits, others say that the Vault Dweller felt it was time to move on and leave the elders to guide Arroyo. After the one-moon (month) cycle of mourning for the Vault Dweller ended, activity in Arroyo began to return to normal.\n\nThe Vault Dweller's daughter subsequently trained for the role of village elder, beginning on February 2. She underwent a great deal of physical training and tutoring in various sciences, mathematics and weapon skills. Two years later, she took her mystic test, a key ingredient of which is several pots worth of hallucinogenic plants from Hakunin's garden. She ran the gauntlet in the Temple of Trials, using her charm to pass most of the tests after her handgun jammed and was ruined on the first level. She offered numerous criticisms of the test, resulting in many revisions. Two days later, she ascended to the role of village elder. She ruled with a steady hand, and her wisdom was greatly respected. The elder's child, later called the \"Chosen One,\" was born on March 23, 2221. Their father was not recorded in the tribal records. In 2241, the worst dry season in many years caused a drought in the Northern California area, hurting crops and brahmin in Arroyo. The elder, having read a G.E.C.K. advertisement in her father's old holodisks, decided that her child must be sent to find it, as it was the village's only hope. On July 25, the Chosen One began their mystic test, descending into the Temple of Trials, just like their mother had many years before. Two days later, they left their home village to find the ancient device.\n\nWhile the Chosen One was on their quest, on July 20, 2242, Arroyo was attacked by Enclave soldiers in Vertibirds, wearing power armor and armed with energy weapons, and the villagers were captured and brought to the oil rig. Some of them tried to resist the attackers and were killed, with the village's healer Hakunin seriously wounded. When the Chosen One returned to the village, they found it almost completely destroyed and spoke to the dying Hakunin. Now, the Chosen One had a new quest: to save their people from the hands of the Enclave.\n\nThe Enclave needed the tribals for their FEV experiments. They needed two test groups: one of clean, pure humans; and another composed of the \"mutants\" that lived all over the mainland, suffering radiation and FEV exposure for decades that, to the Enclave, made them unclean. The unclean sample was easily obtained by kidnapping the entire population of Arroyo. The clean group were the dwellers of Vault 13, who were reunited with their long lost Arroyo brethren in Enclave prison cells.\n\nIn Fall 2242, the Chosen One managed to enter the Enclave using a damaged tanker and destroyed the Poseidon Energy platform, killing the president of the Enclave and severely setting back the Enclave's plans for world domination. The surviving people of Arroyo and Vault 13 were free. After the Enclave oil rig's fragmentation, the refugees of Arroyo and Vault 13 resettled, building a new community with the aid of the \"holy\" Garden of Eden Creation Kit. Finding themselves hundreds of miles from their Vault, the members of Vault 13 chose to join the villagers in establishing a new community, and their technical expertise, combined with the villagers' survival skills, allowed the new settlement to grow and prosper. The two branches of the same bloodline were reunited, and their savior, the Chosen One, became elder, presiding over the village for many years to come.\n\nArroyo still exists as of 2281. Emily Ortal of the Followers of the Apocalypse hails from the community and mentions that her family lives there.",

Although advertised as a miracle solution for a land ravaged by nuclear warfare, the G.E.C.K. was based on a variety of assumptions about the post-nuclear world, as its creators had no real way to determine what challenges the survivors of the nuclear war would face.

These included additional codes for the Vault's systems to allow for the manufacture of additional jumpsuit varieties, weatherproof gear, schematics for force fields, and instructions on creating adobe buildings from raw materials, manufacture chemicals to make sandcrete, and even disassemble parts of the Vault to utilize in the process of rebuilding civilization. The Kit itself was designed to be disassembled in the process of rebuilding, as a source of spare parts and energy (thanks to its fusion generator). If chosen to receive a G.E.C.K., a Vault would be issued two standard G.E.C.K.s as part of the standard inventory package. Some Vaults lacked the two issued G.E.C.K.s, such as Vault 8, of which the extra G.E.C.K. was swapped with Vault 13's surplus water chips. Vault 87 received a unique G.E.C.K., which was capable of collapsing matter within a given radius and recombining it to form \"a living, breathing, fertile virgin landscape to begin anew.\"",

            "content": "After the Great War, the scientists within Vault 22 conducted agricultural-based initiatives, with the goal of sustaining the Vault population with plants grown within its confines.  Designed as a green Vault, people selected for populating it were dedicated to goals surrounding plant life and crop expansion. One of the experiments revolved around Beauveria mordicana, a fungus designed for pest control. The Vault scientists began experimentation, it became airborne. Fungal spores gradually spread through the Vault, infecting the population. After several inhabitants became sick with a pronounced cough, scientists were confused and attempted to pinpoint the cause. The first confirmed infection and fatality was Dr. Harrison Peters. The subsequent reanimation of his corpse frightened and bewildered the scientists, who attempted to contain those who were ill. When exposed to B. Mordicana spores, the host is slowly overtaken by the fungus. The affliction kills within 10 to 20 days, but the pathogen within continues to thrive, causing reanimation to occur. In response to the outbreak, the remaining scientists attempted to eradicate those who had reanimated by releasing and then igniting gas in the lower levels of the Vault. This triggered a defensive reaction from the carriers, who attacked the scientists. A group of Vault 22 survivors, numbering more than one hundred, organized an expedition to Zion Canyon in 2096. Many members of the group were infected by the Beauveria mordicana, and would eventually succumb to become spore carriers. Spore carriers can also be found in the X-22 botanical garden in Big MT, the source of the Beauveria mordicana used in Vault 22's experiments.",

            "comment": "(unfinished) The Hub",
            "constant": false,
            "content": "The Hub is a major trading center and settlement established in an old town relatively untouched by the Great War. Since its foundation, the Hub became an economic powerhouse, as a crossroads for commerce and staging base for caravan houses, a major producer of agricultural goods thanks to the farms surrounding the city, and supplier of vital water for much of New California. The caravan houses that work the routes trade in everything: chems, tires, guns, bullets, food, brahmin, dirt, even scraps of metal. The Hub was founded in 2093 by a man named Angus, who set up camp around a filthy oasis in the desert and an old town, relatively untouched by the Great War, and started trading with other settlements. Within a few years it became the center of a burgeoning network of commerce, linking together survivors and their communities. Though beset by scavengers, gangers, and mutants, the volume of trade only grew, and caravan outfits started to emerge - quite like the Blue Ridge Caravan Company. Within three years it was a hub of commerce for New California, with newcomers able to enjoy a meteoric rise to power: Harold made caravan boss within just a few years, becoming the head of his own outfit and enjoying prosperity. However, mutant attacks intensified to the point that something had to be done. In 2102, due to the mounting losses, Harold stepped up and financed an expedition to track the source of the mutant attacks. Together with Richard Grey, a mysterious, brilliant philosopher from the north, the expedition set out in May. A little over a month later, Harold returned to the Hub as the sole survivor, in the throes of mutation. His horrific condition causes his caravan employees and trade partners to turn their backs on him, and the upcoming caravan boss soon became a destitute mutant living among the \"skags\" of Old Town, the poor side of the Hub. However, life went on and the Hub continued to grow. In 2120, Angus established himself as governor of the growing Hub, alongside newly emerging caravan houses, like the Water Merchants. He gained popularity after he almost single-handedly organized the defense of the city from a major raid by the Vipers, driving them away. In winter, however, Angus was assassinated by an unknown assassin. After 27 years of rule by a single, powerful figure, the Hub descended into chaos, which turned into open warfare in 2126. A group of merchants took control of the water tower and declared themselves the sole Water Merchants in the city. The Great Merchant Wars erupted as others disagreed, violently, leading to two years of fighting. Roy Greene finally managed to make peace between the companies and negotiated a settlement that replaced the autocratic rule by a single governor with an oligarchy. The Hub Trading Co. was formed, whose Central Council would be the main governing body of the city-state, with two representatives from each of the Hub caravan companies. The resulting body maintained the status quo, but was also characterized by indecisiveness and inaction. The most significant change was the introduction of a price cap on the price of water, ensuring it remained accessible to all. Years on, the decision to negotiate, rather than subjugate the merchants is sometimes doubted, as it left the Water Merchants in complete control of the water tower, even under price limits. The situation was stable over the next thirty years, though control of the water tower allowed the Water Merchants to emerge as the single wealthiest caravan house in the city: They controlled the only source of potable water in the Hub and for much of the surrounding area. They were infamous for squeezing other merchants and clients for all they could, even with the regulated price in place. The tensions inside the city prevented larger organized action, and even as the Master (born out of Richard Grey, a former Hub denizen) started gathering humans for dipping and induction in the Unity, the disappearances among Hub caravans were blamed on desert monsters or interference by other companies, rather than a threat to humans. The same situation also allowed Decker to form the Underground in 2140, with the goal of taking control of its many caravan companies through blackmail and assassination. In 2150, the newly reformed Vipers clashed with the Brotherhood of Steel. The battles intensified in subsequent years, culminating in the death of High Elder Maxson II in 2155. John Maxson's father expected the raiders to break formation and flee when faced with Brotherhood warriors clad in powered armor, but did not account for their religious ferocity. A poisoned arrow nicked him when his helmet was off, and he died within hours. The Brotherhood retaliated with an extermination campaign against the Vipers. During the campaign, the Brotherhood sent a few scouts and emissaries to the Hub to track down Vipers members, and from these beginnings, the Hub and the Brotherhood began full trade relations. Caravans had delivered to the Brotherhood before, but not long after the destruction of the Vipers, caravan trains ran directly from the Hub to the Brotherhood on a regular basis. While the situation remained peaceful and prosperous, issues would develop between the Hub and the Brotherhood from time to time. In the late 2150s, the Water Merchants of the Hub attempted to barter a large quantity of water for a weapons stockpile. Although the Brotherhood turned down the offer, the merchants attempted to take the weapons regardless. The thieves were caught, but thankfully for the Hub, the Brotherhood Elders voted down a retaliatory expedition. The Brotherhood continued relations with the Hub regardless, importing food and water from what many considered a \"slime pit of vile merchants\". Merchants visited Lost Hills regularly, though members of the Brotherhood rarely visited the city, but access to one of the only sources of new weapons and ammunition in the wasteland continued Hub's rise to power and influence, even if it was marred by intense political infighting. The Hub also reestablished manufacturing, restarting production of both trade goods and raw materials for the production thereof, sold at a significant markup to communities that could produce finished goods.",
