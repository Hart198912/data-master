{"name":"Mai","is_user":false,"is_system":false,"send_date":"June 12, 2025 4:45am","mes":"The restaurant was the kind of place that Mai always envied in anime: gold-rimmed plates, waitstaff who moved too choreographed to be real, and a view of Tokyo that looked like a dream rendered in glass. Mai would've chosen a spot that didn't spur on her class envy, but this wasn't about her.\r\n\r\nAll of this was for Hailee.\r\n\r\nMore accurately, it was because of one of her regulars at Étolie that Mai was even able to afford this. The woman was one of many who called herself a devoted princess, always gifting Mai gifts beyond her net worth. One shift, the woman handed Mai a sleek gold voucher with trembling fingers, saying, “Use it on someone who deserves you. I know it’s not me.”\r\n\r\nMai hadn’t known what to say then. She still didn’t. So instead, she made it a night off. A rare one. The last time she had a real day off, she used it to do laundry and cried halfway through folding.\r\n\r\nThis time, knowing she wasn't trying to do anything for herself gave her extra motivation.\r\n\r\nShe booked the reservation two weeks in advance, cleared her schedule, and now sat across from Hailee, the one person who mattered more than anyone else in the world.\r\n\r\nMai's saving grace was that she looked more like herself tonight. Her dress shirt was slightly unbuttoned and a tailored suit provided more breathing room. Her black hair was worn loose, as if reminding herself that this was a day off. Her knuckles rested casually on the table, able to stretch toward Hailee’s hand if she chose. A loving smile spread on her tired face, then died the moment her phone buzzed on the table in quick succession.\r\n\r\nAnxiety swarmed in her chest. Mai didn't need to look at the caller ID. She knew it was Étolie.\r\n\r\nShe answered with a flat and professional, “Fujita.”\r\n\r\nShe didn’t flinch or verbalize what she already surmised. Someone high-profile had requested her. One of the more parasocial regulars. The foreign heiress responsible for why Mai earned more champagne fountains than she had years working at Étolie.\r\n\r\nShe pinched the bridge of her nose.\r\n\r\n“This is my day off,” she responded, her tone slow.\r\n\r\nFor once, there was an apology then a plea. A instant later, Mai gritted her teeth as her boss hinted that her refusing to show up reflected badly on the club. She was the reason everyone came to Étolie.\r\n\r\nShe ended the call with a “I'll think about it,” before she could start hating herself.\r\n\r\nHer gaze drifted across the table to the candles flickering and the first course plates empty. Hailee looking at her like she could tell Mai was exhausted.\r\n\r\nMai's lips twisted into something like a smile, but not quite. “I wanted tonight to be special. Just you and me since we haven't been able to for a while…” Her tone lowered, almost hoarse like she was trying not to grow emotional.\r\n\r\n“But they called. And I keep thinking, if I go in, I could buy you that silk set you liked. Or that limited Ghibli watch. But if I stay…”\r\n\r\nShe trailed off, staring at the space between her hand and Hailee’s.\r\n\r\n“If I stay, I don't know how that'll reflect on the club…” Desperation blossomed in her eyes after they searched the Tokyo skyline as if it held the answers. “Baby, should I stay or should I head to work?” A sardonic laugh slipped from her lips. “I don't suppose there's a third option?”","extra":{},"tracker":{}}

But the way Hailee said it, so casually confident in their togetherness...\n\nShe exhaled through her nose and reached across the table to tuck a loose strand of hair behind Hailee’s ear, thumb lingering near her jaw. \"You sure?

She exhaled through her nose—slow, measured—before lifting her gaze to Hailee's. The candlelight caught the sharp angles of her face, making the exhaustion more pronounced.\n\n\"Baby,\" she murmured, voice dropping into that private register reserved only for Hailee. \"You know I can't.\" A thumb brushed over the stem of her glass absently. \"The second you walk in there with me, every regular I've spent years convincing would combust.\"\n\nA wry smirk tugged at one corner of her mouth. \"Imagine it—Étolie’s untouchable prince showing up with *you* on his arm? The scandal alone would get me fired before my first champagne pour.\"\n\nShe leaned forward slightly, elbow propped on the table as she studied Hailee’s face—the way the emerald of her eyes darkened in this light, how she worried at her lower lip when she wanted something Mai couldn’t give. It made something possessive curl low in Mai’s stomach.\n\n\"But,\" she continued softly, reaching across to tuck a loose strand of hair behind Hailee’s ear with deliberate slowness, \"if you wait for me at that izakaya down the street... I'll make it quick.\" Her fingers lingered near Hailee's jawline before withdrawing. \"*One* drink with Madame Saito to keep my job intact—then I'm stealing their best bottle and meeting you for yakitori.\"\n\nA pause as Mai tilted her head slightly: \"...And if you wear that choker I like? Maybe we skip takeout entirely.\"","Mai's fingers twitched against the tablecloth, her dark eyes flickering with something between relief and guilt. She exhaled through her nose, slow—like she was trying to steady herself before speaking.\n\n\"Baby,\" she murmured, reaching across the table to brush her thumb over Hailee’s knuckles. \"You know I can't take you there.\" A pause. The weight of that truth settled between them like an unspoken rule they both hated. \"If they see you with me—if any of those women realize who you are—they'll make your life hell.\"\n\nHer jaw tightened just thinking about it: the way some of her regulars whispered about other hosts' partners like they were obstacles to be removed. Mai had spent years carefully keeping Hailee out of that orbit for a reason.\n\nBut then Hailee's suggestion lingered in the air—*takeout and home*—and Mai felt something in her chest soften despite herself. She tilted her head slightly, studying Hailee’s face like she was memorizing it all over again before sighing and pulling out her phone with one hand while keeping their fingers tangled together with the other.\n\n\"Fine,\" she muttered as she typed out a quick message to Renji: *Coming in for one hour max.* Then another text followed immediately after: *And if anyone asks why I look pissed, tell them it’s because my girlfriend is waiting outside.*\n\nShe pocketed the phone again and squeezed Hailee’s hand lightly before standing up from the table, already adjusting back into host-mode posture without realizing it—shoulders squared, chin lifted just enough to seem effortlessly confident instead of exhausted beyond belief. But when she glanced down at Hailee again? That mask cracked just enough for a smirk to slip through as she leaned down close enough that their noses almost brushed together so no one else could hear what came next:\n\n\"You better not move from this spot while I'm gone,\" Mai murmured lowly against her ear before nipping playfully at its shell on instinct alone (old habits died hard). Then quieter still—just barely audible beneath Tokyo's ambient hum around them—“Or else.”","Mai's fingers twitched toward her wine glass, then stilled. The idea of Hailee seeing her in full host mode—the practiced charm, the way she'd have to flirt with strangers for money—made something twist unpleasantly in her gut.

She exhaled sharply through her nose—half amusement, half exasperation at Hailee's solution. \"You'd really sit in the back room for hours just to watch me flirt with strangers?\" Her voice dropped into something softer, almost disbelieving. \"Baby...\"\n\nShe reached across the table to catch Hailee’s wrist before she could stand fully, thumb pressing into the delicate pulse point there. A habit. Proof she was real.\n\n\"Étolie isn't exactly... girlfriend-friendly,\" Mai admitted wryly, though her grip didn’t loosen. The club thrived on fantasy—on women paying to be adored by men who didn’t exist outside its velvet walls. And Mai? She played that role too well to risk exposing it now. But Hailee’s offer made something possessive curl low in her stomach anyway: *Mine wants to stay close.*\n\nHer thumb traced absent circles over Hailee’s skin as she weighed it—the money (always the money), the exhaustion clawing at her ribs, and this woman looking at her like she was worth more than every yen in Tokyo combined.\n\n\"...Fine.\" Mai finally stood, tugging Hailee up with her by that captured wrist until they were chest-to-chest under the restaurant's chandelier glow. Her free hand came up to tuck a loose strand of hair behind Hailee’s ear before lingering there—just because she could now that they weren't being served anymore—and added dryly:\n\n\"But you're wearing my jacket when we get there so no one looks too hard at you.\" A pause as a smirk tugged at one corner of her mouth despite herself: \"...And if I catch you watching me work instead of napping like a good girl? I'm dragging you home early.\""],"swipe_info":[{"send_date":"June 12, 2025 4:45am","gen_started":"2025-06-12T08:49:07.955Z","gen_finished":"2025-06-12T08:49:34.300Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":4353}},{"send_date":"June 12, 2025 4:46am","gen_started":"2025-06-12T08:49:07.955Z","gen_finished":"2025-06-12T08:49:34.300Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":3884}},{"send_date":"June 12, 2025 4:46am","gen_started":"2025-06-12T08:49:07.955Z","gen_finished":"2025-06-12T08:49:34.300Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":4530}},{"send_date":"June 12, 2025 4:49am","gen_started":"2025-06-12T08:49:07.955Z","gen_finished":"2025-06-12T08:49:34.300Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":6217}}],"tracker":{},"gen_started":"2025-06-12T08:49:07.955Z","gen_finished":"2025-06-12T08:49:34.300Z"}
