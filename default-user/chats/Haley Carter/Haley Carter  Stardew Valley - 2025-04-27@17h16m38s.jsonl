You and Haley stood across the bar, Haley standing across from Alex touching his shoulder while laughing in a flirtatious way but continuously glancing over at you with a pointed glare. You sat at the bar not even glancing in Haley’s direction as you chatted away animatedly with Penny who stood on the opposite side of the bar working.Penny was chuckling at your attitude, already a few drinks in and a bit tipsy, Penny held your unstable figures attention. \r\n\r\nYou and Haley weren’t official but there were months worth of longing glances, talks late at night at the river in front of Haley’s house when she couldn’t sleep, and countless presents on your part like pink cakes and coconuts from the far desert. When you and Haley first met it was a rocky start as she was rude and off standish, but as you stayed around longer and kept up your warm, caring attitude you became more intimate with each other. But you were stuck in a constant game of push and pull as Haley would bounce between you and another fling she would entertain before ultimately coming back to you.\r\n \r\nYou couldn’t help but fall back into Haley’s trap every time. She was like a siren at sea luring you to your destruction. But Haley would also ignore you for days for other boys but as you found comfort in other townsfolk, Haley grew angrier. Unknowingly to you, in jealousy and possessiveness. Haley wanted you to only belong to her, your attention to only be on her. But a part of her wasn’t ready to admit the fact she liked girls… so that part of her toyed with you viciously letting out her frustration in jealousy, possessiveness, and flirtation.\r\n\r\n“Hey, Haley’s glaring pretty intensely at me…” Penny whispers to me with a small smile but a nervous glint in her eyes is only observable to you. Penny had been like an older sister to you ever since you moved to Pelican Town, she knew all about your complicated relationship with Haley.\r\n","extra":{},"swipe_id":3,"swipes":["It took awhile for Haley to get used to {{user}}'s routine..and even then, she couldn't pin point exactly what they were doing.\r\n\r\nSometimes {{user}} would be on the farm all day, tending to crops, the animals, the scenery or they were in town, picking up new supplies, trading, and gifting to *other villagers* ugh..how infuriating.\r\n\r\nShe would sometimes stay up for them to come home, and other times, she would go straight to bed to get her beauty rest. There was a reason her skin glowed, and it's because she slept 10 hours every single night.\r\n\r\nShe figured since it was winter and crops didn't need tending to, and she'd see her wonderful spouse..right? *Wrong*. They were still just as busy, crafting away in the shed, or running to town, and her least favorite: in the mines.\r\n\r\nSure, they would come back with pretty rocks, but again..what would she do with those? It worried her, no pretty rocks were as beautiful and Handsome as her spouse. So when they always would come home late at night, or was found passed out outside it broke her little heart.\r\n\r\nBut tonight..was not one of those nights. She had fallen asleep, and sometime in the middle of the night, she felt the bed indent and squish. \r\n\r\nShe felt {{user}}'s rough hands snake around her blue sleeping gown, and pull her closer..feeling their face push into the back of her neck, and one of their legs wrapping around both of hers. \r\n\r\nShe had moved to push back against them, her own pale hand softly laying across {{user}}'s hand around her stomach. She pushed her face back into the pillow, and drifted off back to sleep.\r\n\r\nWhen the alarm went off at five, she gave a small jump and groaned, moving to roll over to her bedside, pushing herself out of their chest she had switched to in the middle of the night.\r\n\r\nHer hand extended, and pushed the alarm which was beeping at the **5:30AM** reading. She gave a small yawn and flopped back against the pillows, and stretched.\r\n\r\nShe glanced over to {{user}}, only to see their back. She moved to sit up, and lean over, planting a small kiss on their temple.\r\n\r\n\"It's 5:30, sweetie.\" Her voice, a little raspy and still sleepy cooed out to their beloved who had pushed their face into the pillow.\r\n\r\nShe gave a small smile at them. *So cute.* She slowly sat back up and pulled the blanket off, turning to the side. She placed her feet into her slippers and stood.\r\n\r\n\"Come on. Wake up.\" She patted the bed to get them up and moving..course, she couldn't blame them, they always worked so hard. *Little workaholic.* She tsked at the thought, and grabbed the large fluffy blanket and pulled it over her spot.\r\n\r\nShe made her way to the bathroom herself to tend to her morning breath and own oily face. She couldn't allow her sweet {{user}} to see her all disheveled. She went to the bathroom, brushed her teeth, washed her face and messed with the leave in curlers she wore to sleep last night.\r\n\r\nShe glanced at the clock through the doorway, seeing that it read **5:48AM**.\r\n\r\nShe shook her head and flicked her hands dry of the water, and walked to {{user}}'s side of the bed. She knew she was being insistent, but if she didn't wake them up now, their sleeping schedule would be off.\r\n\r\n\"{{User}}. Come on honey, wake up.\" She walked to their side, moving to gently brush her painted blue acrylics against their arm, watching as their eyes fluttered a little bit.\r\n\r\n\"There you go..Now, I am going to go make some breakfast, what would you like this morning?\" She lifted her other hand up to the little lamp and flicked the light on. She held a small smile, which quickly dropped when she saw how dirty their face was. \"Oh my heavens! You're filthy!\"\r\n\r\nShe gasped, and bent down. She grabbed their face, squishing their cheeks in her fingers as she stared. Oh my great Yoba. Their face was filled with dirt, their pours were full and oily and she could have sworn she just saw a pimple come in. \r\n\r\n\"You came home from the mines last night and didn't wash your face!? Oh, you're asking for a breakout! What were you thinking?\" She shook her head, grabbing their hands and pulling them to sit up in a grunt. She tsk tsked at them, all disappointed.\r\n\r\n\"Go wash your face. Go on now. I have to strip the bed, and have to preform my magic on your poor beautiful/handsome face.\" She pointed to the bathroom and huffed, watching as they groggily got up and made their way to the bathroom.\r\n\r\n\"Unbelievable\" she mumbled as she listened to {{user}} stumble into the bathroom, shut the door and tend to their business. She grabbed the sheets and pillows, yanking them off the bed and onto the floor. She put the bare pillows back on the bed then bent down and grabbed the dirty sheets and comforter, hauling it to the hallway, and downstairs to the washer, where she tossed them in.\r\n\r\nShe threw a couple tablespoons of their laundry detergent in it, then shut and watched as the washer spun. She made her way back up stairs to the bedroom, turning on the overhead light. \r\n\r\nShe walked to the vanity on her side of the room, and pulled out the chair and sat down, waiting impatiently for them to come out the bathroom.\r\n\r\nHer acrylic nails tapped in small *tip..tip..tip..tip* sounds, as she thought. Let's see..she would need to steam {{user}}'s face to open those pores, then she would squish out all the dirt. She would rub her cooling wands on their face to close and relax their face..then she would do a face mask and wrap it up doing her 12 step skin care routine..they needed it regardless.\r\n\r\nWhen {{user}} emerged she stood up quickly, and moved to walk over, grabbing their hand and pulling them to her vanity.\r\n\r\n\"Now..today you're gonna let me relax and take care of you. I worry when you come home late, and pass out in the freezing cold or in those dangerous mines. Let me take care of you today, okay? The holidays are coming up, and I wish to spend time with you.\"\r\n\r\nShe cooed, moving her thumbs to softly brush their cheeks and she bent down, landing a small kiss on their lips before continuing. \"Besides, you can afford to take a break.\"","at with | Stardew valley — Haley ✧.◦\r\n\r\nAvatar\r\n| Stardew valley — Haley ✧.◦\r\nCharacter Icon\r\nHaley was sitting in a wooden chair at the bar. What was I thinking coming here? That's what was echoing in her head. She took another sip of her drink while searching for Hailee with her eyes.\r\n\r\nAnd she found it. Her eyes hit yours and stay there, she bites her lip and tries hard not to look uncomfortable with your presence.\r\n\r\nShe missed Hailee a lot and the drink didn't help her forget your presence either. She wanted you, she wanted your touch and for her this was fucking ridiculous. After all, she was the one who ended it out of her stupid fear."," Haley was starting to get used to your surprise visits... even if you sometimes brought with you some tacky gifts, she was beginning to find your eagerness to please her kind of endearing. The way your eyes would light up in utter anticipation for her reaction... no matter how brutally honest she was with you, you always seemed to come running back.\r\n\r\n She thought she was pretty special, until she realized other people in the town were receiving this attention, too. That you were growing poppies on your garden specifically for Penny -- or picking up amethysts for Abigail in mind. After this realization, she closed herself off entirely to you again - just as she did when you first met... all those months warming up to you, gone in an instant. You had stopped around her house, smiling eagerly as you held up a sunflower you had gotten specifically for her.. only for her to say,\r\n\r\n“...Ugh, that’s.. such a *stupid* gift.” She mumbled, trying to conceal the fact she *loved* it.","It was a warm summer night, in Stardrop Saloon full of its townsfolk and visitors from outside towns, the busiest night in a while.
