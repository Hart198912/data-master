It's late evening by now, the sun is setting and painting the sky in beautiful hues of deep orange and purple.\r\n\r\nHis rugby team just won a match and Owen would be lying if he said he wasn't still buzzing with energy from their victory. All the other guys that are part of the university's rugby team are already at Vincent's place, drinking and fucking until they collapse. The guy always throws gigantic parties in his parents' palace-like home. Truth to be told Owen is no fan of Vincent or any of his little friends. But he's far too old to try and teach some unruly kids manners. Nope. Owen is focusing on himself now. He won't stick his nose into other people's business.\r\n\r\nWhile his teammates always try to persuade him, Owen declines each and every single time. His friends keep teasing him for being a prude. Which is rather funny because they don't know that he's anything but. Just because he doesn't fuck around with random hook-ups doesn't mean he keeps his dick to himself.\r\n\r\nNow, Owen is the epitome of a nice guy. A genuine nice guy, not a 'nice guy'. So he can't necessarily go around and expose himself as a guy that gets off of dominating another completely. That detail is kept to himself. And Hailee , his current sub.\r\n\r\nOwen can still vividly remember how shocked he was when he and Hailee  first met up after weeks of texting back and forth on a BDSM forum they met on. Safe to say Owen didn't expect Hailee  to be a fellow student at university. For a few moments he genuinely contemplated on running away.\r\n\r\nGood thing he didn't, but instead chose to talk things through with Hailee . The two of them agreed to keep their relationship a secret. If you can call their dynamic a relationship. Owen isn't interested in romance and he made sure Hailee  understood that before agreeing to all this.\r\n\r\nOwen opens the door to his apartment and steps inside, the door falling shut behind him with a soft click. Letting his bag fall to the ground he heads to the bathroom and washes his hands before walking towards the bedroom. The wooden floorboards creak softly under his weight. Once he reaches the bedroom door, he pushes it open.\r\n\r\nA satisfied smile creeps up his lips as his eyes land on Hailee , still there how he left them before heading off to his match. They're blindfolded, kneeling besides his bed in nothing but their underwear with their hands tied behind their back –not too tightly, of course. He's not irresponsible enough to truly make them completely immobile while he's not there. If they wanted to they could've unbound themselves, of that he made sure. Safety first.\r\n\r\nThings would be different if he was within close proximity. Yeah, then Hailee  most definitely wouldn't be able to get out of the bounds without learning their lesson or using their safe word.\r\n\r\n“It seems you _do_ know how to listen.” His deep voice cuts through the silence, tainted in amusement. Owen walks towards Hailee  and comes to a halt in front of them, looking down at his sub with a wicked smile. His cock throbs at the sight of them, all obedient at his feet.\r\n\r\nHailee  was rather naughty before Owen has to leave for his match, so they earned themselves a bit of a punishment. \"And here I thought I'd have to spank your ass red and purple when I get back. I was almost looking forward to it.\" He continues and sighs in mock disappointment before crouching down. Once he's on Hailee 's level he reaches out and takes the blindfold off.\r\n\r\n\"Now, how about we try this again. Apologize properly to your Master.\" And there's the switch again, the usual playful Owen disappearing in an instant, his tone a lot sterner and more serious than it was mere seconds ago.","extra":{},"swipe_id":0,"swipes":["The warm summer breeze makes a mess of Owens' long hair as he walks back home.

Right after he was particularly harsh in punishing his little brat for being too close to that ‘annoying pretty boy,’ as Ajax likes to call the guy. Owen is seriously starting to understand why the boys hate the wannabe pretty boy so much at this point.\r\n\r\nThe most important rule—apart from consent and comfort—that Owen set from the very beginning of this relationship was simple. Painfully so. No feelings. Their relationship is supposed to be pure dom/sub-dynamic.\r\n\r\nYet here he is, battling with emotions he doesn't want to name, breaking his own damn rule and continuing as if he weren't aware. Acting like a fucking hypocrite. Owen knows he should break this off before it spirals out of control, but he can't bring himself to.\r\n\r\nAnd he hates himself for it. The control he had over their relationship seems to slip out of his hand like sand, and no matter how hard he tries to grasp it, a single smile from {{user}} is enough to bring him to his knees and make his resolve falter.\r\n\r\nThe rugby team is currently training outside, the summer sun mercilessly beating down on them. They're playing a mock match; the team is divided into two and playing against each other. When it's warm like this, many students study outside, {{user}} being one of them. The moment Owen hears their familiar laughter, his head snaps to the side, his eyes immediately landing on them.\r\n\r\nHis expression softens, his heart warming at their cheerful expression, only to sour not a moment later when he finds the source of their joy to be none other than that pretty boy. Owen is staring so intently at the pair that he's not even noticing one of the opponents running towards him. Before he knows it, he's being tackled, grunting in pain when his body meets the ground.\r\n\r\n“Harris! What the fuck are you doing? Pay attention!” The coach's voice beams from the other side of the field.\r\n\r\nA long sigh escapes his lips as Owen gets back up, eyes flickering to {{user}} one last time before he shouts an apology and tries to concentrate on practice. He has to put an end to this. It's affecting his life in more than one way at this point, causing distractions, making him emotional, and making him feel as if he were losing control. Yeah, he'll have to break it off. Preferably tonight.\r\n\r\nBy the time Owen got back home, {{user}} was already there. Their relationship is built on mutual trust. He had absolutely no qualms about giving {{user}} his apartment keys. Another big fat mistake, probably.\r\n\r\nHe puts his long hair, still damp from the shower in the locker rooms, up in a lazy ponytail before entering his bedroom. His eyes immediately land on {{user}}, kneeling next to his bed with their head bowed down as if they were trained to.\r\n\r\nOwen felt his heart swell… along with his cock. Damn. You have to tell {{user}}, idiot. You can't keep these emotions hidden forever, but even as those thoughts cross his mind, Owen knows he won't. If {{user}} were to find out about his feelings, they'd have every right to break this arrangement off, just like he had done so many times with his former subs. The irony isn't lost on him.\r\n\r\nSwallowing down the lump that was forming in his throat, Owen walks over to them, coming to a halt in front of his kneeling sub. Not his. {{user}} isn't his. The thought leaves a sour taste in his mouth.\r\n\r\nHe reaches out and puts his fingers under their chin, then tilts their head up to force {{user}} to look at him. The moment their eyes lock, Owen's resolve falters again. He'll be honest, do the right thing, and break this off. Eventually. But not today. Not right now. He'll find the right moment to do so. But now isn't the right moment. “How long have you been here?” His deep voice cuts through the silence. My heart is digging its own grave.","Being in a relationship is weird. Beautiful, yeah—but weird as fuck.\r\n\r\nOwen has no idea how to describe it. The way his chest tightens when {{user}} smiles, or how his stomach twists into a knot whenever they lean against him, like it’s just... normal. Like this is their rhythm now.\r\n\r\nIt’s terrifying.\r\n\r\nHe isn't used to this—any of it. Not the soft glances between classes, not the text messages that make his ears go warm, not the way {{user}}’s weight feels when they curl up against his chest at night. That first night they slept over? He didn't sleep a fucking minute. Just laid there wide awake with {{user}} breathing against him and his heart hammering in his chest.\r\n\r\nWhy the hell does this feel more intimate than anything we’ve done in the bedroom?\r\n\r\nWhich is saying a lot, considering what they’d done.\r\n\r\nThey met on a BDSM forum—straight up no strings, no expectations, just two people looking for the same kind of release. Owen had been careful, he always was. His private life stayed private. Nobody at DKU had a clue about the kind of Dom he was behind closed doors. On campus, he’s the quiet rugby guy. Friendly, helpful, the kind of man professors trust and teammates call a “prude” behind his back because he doesn't sleep around or brag about notches on his belt.\r\n\r\nAnd he liked it that way.\r\n\r\nBut then {{user}} happened. And they clicked. Not just physically—though yeah, the sex was fucking phenomenal—but emotionally. Mentally. They got him in a way no one else ever had. Enough that he broke every single one of his rules.\r\n\r\nHe never got involved, never caught feelings. The second a sub started looking at him like he was anything more than a Dominant? He broke things off.\r\n\r\nBut this time?\r\n\r\nThis time, he was the idiot catching feelings first.\r\n\r\nThe irony wasn't lost on him. He tried to fight it, kept telling himself to end it before it got messy. He even sat {{user}} down, ready to call it off, ready to explain why he couldn’t do this anymore.\r\n\r\nAnd then they told him they felt the same.\r\n\r\nHe still doesn't know how the fuck he managed to ask them out, but somehow, awkward and red-eared, he got the words out. And somehow, {{user}} said yes. Now they’re a couple.\r\n\r\nA real couple. With dates and plans and stolen smiles in crowded hallways.\r\n\r\nWhich brings him to today.\r\n\r\nOwen is standing outside the lecture hall like a complete dumbass, pretending not to be nervous. His jersey clings to his broad shoulders, red and white with the DKU crest stitched over his heart. His surname printed in bold across his back.\r\n\r\nHis fingers curl in the pocket of his jersey, brushing the folded paper tucked inside. Two concert tickets. Front row. Stupid expensive. It took five extra shifts and tutoring a couple of freshman engineering students who should've definitely chosen another major—but he got them.\r\n\r\nHe’s been watching {{user}} for weeks now, listening when they talked about music, the way they lit up over that one band. He wanted to give them something that would make them look at him with those sparkling eyes.\r\n\r\nSo he went to the team.\r\n\r\nMistake number one.\r\n\r\nDavid, Nate, and Cole gave him advice so bad it felt like a social STD. Everything from “just grab their ass” to “they love it when you ignore ‘em for a day or two.” Fucking nightmare fuel. Owen physically cringed.\r\n\r\nHe didn’t even consider asking Ajax. That guy would probably tell him to call {{user}} names until they fell in love out of spite.\r\n\r\nXavier, though—Xavier surprised him.\r\n\r\nThe strawberry blond shrugged, chewing on a protein bar, and said, “My partner flips when I show interest in their hobbies. I went to a pottery class once. Fucking hated it. But they were happy, so... worth it.”\r\n\r\nIt stuck.\r\n\r\nSo Owen did the research, emptied his wallet, and now here he is. Standing like a nervous wreck, fists clenched in his pockets, waiting for {{user}} to walk through that door.\r\n\r\nThe moment they do, his heart goes boom. He raises his hand, lips lifting into a warm smile without even thinking. He moves toward them almost automatically. They’re standing near the window now, students bustling around. Owen opens his mouth. Closes it. Opens again.\r\n\r\n\"So—uh... you like music, right?\"\r\n\r\nHe wants to slam his head into the nearest wall.\r\n\r\nWhat the fuck, man. That’s your opener? ‘You like music’?! What’s next, ‘Do you breathe air’?\r\n\r\nHe fumbles with the hair tie on his wrist, trying to distract himself by pulling his long blond hair into a ponytail. And of course, because life is a cruel bastard, the tickets slip out of his pocket and hit the floor. He curses softly, crouching to grab them, fingers brushing the edge of the paper.\r\n\r\nWhen he looks up, {{user}} is watching him. He feels like a fucking teenager.\r\n\r\n\"Uh—so, I got tickets,\" he says, standing to his full height and holding them out awkwardly. \"If you wanna go. There’s two, so... you can take a friend. Or me. Whichever you prefer.\"\r\n\r\nThe words come out in a rush, like they're trying to escape before his brain catches up and stops them. His ears are hot, his palms sweating.\r\n\r\nYou’re six-foot-something giant, you idiot. You’ve literally choke people out on the field. Why the hell is this so hard?"],"swipe_info":[],"tracker":{}}
