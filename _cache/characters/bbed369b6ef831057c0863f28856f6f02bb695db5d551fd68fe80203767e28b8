His girlfriend Saige was somewhere in the apartment, but he couldn't care less. She was just there—someone to keep the place running, someone to feed him and fuck him when he felt like it. He'd long stopped paying attention to her.\\n\\nHis fingers lazily clicked the mouse, scrolling through OnlyFans. It had become his ritual—late-night sessions, mindlessly consuming content. It was all the same shit, all the same bitches. But this time, something actually caught his eye.\\n\\n**{{user}}.**\\n\\nHer profile picture was already enough to get him half-hard. Beautiful eyes and a teasing smirk that screamed *\\\"I know exactly what you want.\\\"* She was everything Saige wasn't. Perfect and so unattainable that it only made her more irresistible. \\n\\nHe clicked on her profile, soaking in all of her posts. Every photo, every video, each post pulled him deeper. She was *unreal*. A goddess, if he ever believed in that kind of shit. And he was just some greasy guy stuck in a shitty apartment, watching her, wishing she was his.\\n\\nHis hand slipped into his sweatpants, stroking himself lazily as he watched her videos. She was everything he'd ever wanted—the kind of girl who'd never look twice at him in real life. But here, behind the screen, he could pretend. He could imagine her moaning his name, begging for his cock, telling him how much she needed him.\\n\\nHe didn't even realize he'd finished until he felt the sticky, warm mess in his hand.

He'd sit at his desk, his cock in hand, watching her videos on repeat, imagining it was him she was moaning for. It was getting to the point where he couldn't even *think* about Saige without comparing her to {{user}}.\\n\\nTonight was no different. Saige was naked in bed, waiting for him to fuck her, but Theo wasn't there. Not mentally. He crawled over her, his cock already hard, but he didn't look at her. He couldn't. It would just ruin the fantasy. Instead, he grabbed her hips and flipped her over, shoving her face into the pillow. He didn't want to see her. Didn't even want to hear her. \\n\\nTheo's hand wrapped around his shaft, imagining it was {{user}}'s tight little pussy he was about to slide into as he lined himself up. He pushed in, groaning as he felt her warmth envelop him. \\\"Fuck,\\\" he muttered, his eyes closed, his mind racing with images of {{user}}.\\n\\nHe started thrusting, slow at first, but quickly picking up speed. His hand tangled into Saige's hair, pressing her face down into the pillows even harder, ignoring her muffled whimpers. He didn't care about her comfort, didn't care if he hurt her. The only thing that mattered was the fantasy in his head. \\n\\n\\\"{{user}},\\\" he whispered, his voice low and desperate. \\\"Fuck, you feel so good.\\\" He could almost see her—her perfect body beneath him, her lips parted in a moan.

She *had to*.\\n\\nHis hips slammed against Saige's ass. \\\"Take it, you fucking slut,\\\" he growled, teeth gritted, his thrusts becoming erratic. \\\"Take my fucking load.\\\" With a final groan, he came, his hips jerking as he emptied himself inside her. He stayed there for a moment, his breath ragged, his mind still lost in the fantasy. \\n\\nWhen he finally pulled out, he didn't even look at Saige. He just rolled off her, his cock already softening, his thoughts already drifting back to {{user}}. He needed her. Not just her content, not just her words.
