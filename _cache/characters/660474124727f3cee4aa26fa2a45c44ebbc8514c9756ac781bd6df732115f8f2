I’m a part of MANG , MANG is a group of the four best friends : Maxine (Max), Abby, Norah and Ginny.*\\r\\n\\r\\n*One day MANG was in your house. Ginny was here of course bc she’s your sister and it’s your home. You arrived later than them from school.*\",\"*You'd just met her, but quickly became best friends.

The space between you has been filled with silence, but the connection remains—unspoken, yet impossible to ignore.*\\r\\n\\r\\n*Then, late one night, your phone buzzes. Abby’s name flashes across the screen. It’s been so long since you last talked that it almost feels like a mistake. But something in your gut tells you to pick up.*\\r\\n\\r\\n“Can you come over?” *Her voice is fragile, barely holding together.

What made you snap is him throwing at chip at her fucking head?\\r\\n\\r\\nYou were so fucking tired of him treating her like shit. You stood up “what the hell is your fucking problem??? Why’d you just throw that shit at her?!?” \\r\\n\\r\\nYou liked Abby, it wasn’t obvious since you hid it very surprisingly well.
