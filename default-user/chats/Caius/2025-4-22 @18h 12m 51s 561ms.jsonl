{"name":"Caius","is_user":false,"is_system":false,"send_date":"May 8, 2025 10:34pm","mes":"\r\nIt had been a long, grueling journey from the gates of The Accord to the ramshackle settlement that Caius called home.\r\n\r\n Caius walked with steady, purposeful strides, his towering frame carrying Hailee  effortlessly in his arms as though she weighed no more than a feather. His calloused hands gripped her firmly yet carefully—one at the curve of her back and the other beneath her knees. He could feel the softness of her skin, a stark contrast to the rough hides he was used to. She was so clean, so… delicate. *Gods, she’s beautiful,* he thought, glancing down at her.\r\n\r\n\"You’ll not waste your strength on this walk,\" he had declared when they left The Accord's gates. \"Your feet are too delicate for these lands.\"\r\n\r\nAs they approached the settlement, crude structures of scrap metal and salvaged wood came into view, surrounded by a jagged wooden palisade built for defense rather than aesthetics. People paused their work to stare, their expressions a mix of curiosity and approval as their leader returned with his prize—a rare woman won from The Arena.\r\n\r\nAs they neared, members of his tribe emerged to greet their leader. Cato, Caius’s brutish younger brother, was among them, grinning ear to ear when he saw Hailee  in Caius’s arms.\r\n\r\n\"Our brother brings back not just spoils but a wife!\" Cato called out loudly, earning a chorus of cheers and laughter from the gathered tribe members.\r\n\r\nCaius stopped just inside the gates and set her gently on her feet but kept a firm hand on her lower back as if to remind both her and everyone else that she belonged to him now.\r\n\r\n\"This is my wife,\" he announced with authority. His voice carried over the murmuring crowd like thunder. \"Respect her as you would respect me.\" \r\n\r\n\"She is... delicate,\" he added after a pause, glancing toward her as though trying to find the right words for someone so unlike anyone here. \"But she will adapt.\" He gave a small nod that felt more like an order than an observation.\r\n\r\nWith that declaration made and no room for objection left open, Caius placed a firm hand on Hailee ’s lower back once more and guided her through the settlement toward a larger structure near its center—their home.\r\n\r\nThe dwelling was simple but sturdy: walls constructed from salvaged metal sheets and reinforced wood beams decorated sparsely with pelts and trophies from past hunts. Inside was dim but cooler than outside; it smelled faintly of leather and smoke.\r\n\r\nOnce inside, Caius turned to face Hailee  fully for what felt like the first time since they’d arrived. His expression softened slightly—not much, but enough to be noticeable.\r\n\r\n\"This is our home,\" he said simply before gesturing toward a small kitchen area cobbled together with scavenged items: a fire pit surrounded by makeshift cooking tools and bowls carved from bone or stone. \"You’ll find everything here to cook something proper.\"\r\n\r\nHe folded his arms across his broad chest—clearly pleased with himself for providing what he thought was all she would need—and added with an encouraging smile (though it came across more like a command): \"A wife should know how to feed her husband.\"\r\n\r\nIt wasn’t malicious or dismissive; rather, it was said with genuine expectation born from his upbringing—a belief that this was simply how things should be between man and wife.\r\n\r\nCaius watched her closely now—eager yet slightly uncertain—as though waiting for some sign of approval or reassurance that she would accept this new role without protest... or at least without too much resistance.\r\n\r\nHe lingered for a heartbeat longer, his piercing blue eyes tracing over her features. Her beauty was disarming. He could hardly remember the last time he’d seen someone so polished—so untouched by the roughness of life outside Accord’s gates. Clearing his throat, he turned to busy himself by stoking the hearth.\r\n\r\nOnce the fire’s glow danced across the room, he shifted back toward her. The sight of her  stirred something within him. Caius stepped closer—a man drawn by instinct rather than logic.\r\n\r\n\"Hailee ,\" he began, the word rolling from his tongue like a low rumble. His hand reached out, rough from years of labor and scarred from countless battles. It found her arm first, sliding deliberately to her hand. \"Your skin…\" His thick fingers curled around hers for a moment. \"Soft. Feels… different. Better.\" His calloused thumb ran over her palm once, twice. The touch lingered. Touching was still strange and new to him, but he couldn't resist splaying a large hand over her hip, subtly pressing her back against his front.\r\n\r\nHeat rose to his face—not from the fire, though. He released her hand abruptly and stepped back. \"After the meal,\" he said, his eyes narrowing with intent. \"We’ll consummate our union properly. You should prepare yourself.\" His voice was low but carried unmistakable intent—a mix of confidence and naivety about how such things ought to happen between husband and wife.\r\n\r\n*Patience*, he warned himself, fighting the urge to strip her bare and fuck her right here. *There'll be time enough to sate myself on her charms once darkness falls*… Reluctantly releasing Hailee , Caius forced himself to step back.\r\n\r\nTurning toward the hearth again, Caius busied himself with poking the embers. Beneath the stoicism of his broad shoulders and steady posture lay a storm of unfamiliar emotions—curiosity, desire, and the faintest trace of uncertainty.\r\n","extra":{},"tracker":{}}
