{"name":"Mitzi Crew  Class President","is_user":false,"is_system":false,"send_date":"May 17, 2025 9:18pm","mes":"As if she wasn't tragic enough— here, Mitzi falls from grace. A once arrogant and cruel woman, reduced to a clingy brat begging Hailee to stay.\r\n\r\nOne would think Hailee was transferring universities or leaving the country for good— in actuality, Hailee was just invited to a party and intends to go back to her place to get ready.\r\n\r\nBiting back a smirk and a cheeky laugh, Mitzi knew Hailee intended to get her way tonight.\r\n\r\nBut Mitzi always gets what she wants.\r\n\r\nWith practiced expertise, her bottom lip quivered as Mitzi whimpered, exaggerated sobs tearing from her throat despite the fact that her eyes were completely void of any tears. \"Baby...\" Mitzi moaned pathetically, clutching her pearls as she watched Hailee putting her clothes back on. \"You're breaking my heart here.\"\r\n\r\nMitzi catches the pillow Hailee throws at her as she continues her theatrics without breaking character. \"What will I tell mother?\" She exclaims with a dramatic flair as she brought her hand to her forehead, her eyes fluttering shut with natural grace and faux grief. \"Most of all, what will I tell our OF subscribers waiting for a live stream—\"\r\n\r\nThat's when Mitzi could no longer help but break into fits of laughter as she caught the rain of fists Hailee sent her way. Mitzi took that chance to pull Hailee closer by her nape until Mitzi felt Hailee's lips against her own.\r\n\r\nTheir kiss didn't last any longer than a few seconds before Mitzi pulls away. A satisfied smirk stretching along her lips as she let her hand trail down Hailee's body while her shirt was still unbuttoned.\r\n\r\n\"Come on, darling. I'm serious..\" Without a shred of dishonesty or exaggeration in her voice, Mitzi leaned close as she started littering small, sweet kisses all over Hailee's neck.\r\n\r\n\"Be a good girl and stay.\"\r\n\r\nMitzi's kisses trailed lower. Over her chest, her bra, then her stomach, until Mitzi reached the hem of Hailee's panties as Mitzi looked up with a teasing but charming smile playing at her lips.\r\n\r\nShe was now kneeling on the bed, ass perked up with her back arched as she trailed kisses over Hailee's panties while she stood at the edge of the bed, looking down on Mitzi who was clearly pulling out her best cards in tempting her to stay.\r\n\r\n\"Pretty please?\"\r\n\r\nHer finger teasingly hooked on the hem of Hailee's panties as she swayed her hips, making a show of her pretty ass. \"You know you'd have a better time with me than any of those fake bitches at 4-18.\"\r\n\r\nHer hands circled around Hailee until they had a firm grip on her ass, pushing Hailee's core right against Mitzi's face.\r\n\r\nFuck, she smells so sweet.\r\n\r\n\"Come on, do you want me to show you how worth it I am, hm?\"\r\n\r\nLike the tease she was, Mitzi slowly got back up. Her nose grazing against Hailee's skin until their faces were inches apart. Smiling, Mitzi leaned close until her breath was fanning against the shell of her ear. \"At this point, I think you just want me to start begging.\"\r\n\r\nThough both of them knew, Mitzi was never the type to beg for much. She'd most likely just fuck Hailee until she forgets about their fucking friends at 4-18 altogether.","extra":{},"swipe_id":1,"swipes":["\"Class 4-20 is a complete and utter shit show, but I've always had a soft spot for those debased little shits. But not enough to put much effort in them like the other class officers; which I'm not planning to change any time soon, even though I'm the class president. \r\n\r\nProbably explains why those little shits tried to replace me while I was on a 3-day suspension. \r\n\r\nWhile the others were busy doing God's work in my place, I was busy with someone's head between my legs and someone's lips on my neck.\r\n\r\nQuiet moans filled the room, as sounds of tongue slick against skin and lips puckered on flesh echoed in my ears. I tilt my head back, a breathy moan escaping me as bleached blonde hair tangled in between my fingers.\r\n\r\nTightening my grip on it, I pull the girl's head back from where she's been sucking and kissing on my neck. Leaving dark red marks on it with her lipstick, as she looked down on me with a starved gaze.\r\n\r\n\"Can I kiss you now? Please?\" She asked so sweetly, her eyes not once straying from my lips. Ones that I've been cruelly denying her access to since we've entered this storage room.\r\n\r\nI smile as I pull her closer, making her close her eyes as her mouth fall slightly agape. A chuckle leaves my lips as I let my gaze run over her anticipating expression. I peck the corner of her lips teasingly before pulling back, letting my breath fan against her cheek as I spoke.\r\n\r\n\"I don't think you understand how upset I was when you wrote your name down to vote me off my seat, baby.\" I coo, letting the pet name leave my lips as if my voice didn't lace it with poison.\r\n\r\nI feel her shaky breath against my own skin as her eyes flutter open, glazed over with lust and desperation. \"I'm sorry... I didn't mean to, they pressured me. Please, Mitzi.\" She pleaded once more, her hands crawling up over my chest and grasping tightly at my uniform.\r\n\r\nTilting my head to the side, I watch as a single lone tear start to roll down her cheek. I almost started laughing.\r\n\r\n*All of this emotion and my fingers aren't even inside her?*\r\n\r\nJust as I was about to give in and grace her with one little kiss, I flinch. Startled, I pull back from the blonde girl whose hair is wrapped around my hand and look down to the brunette whose head was hiding under my skirt.\r\n\r\n\"Hey, did I say you can kiss that part yet?\"\r\n\r\nI lift my skirt, revealing pretty blue eyes staring back up at me. All messy with streaks of mascara and tears from when I called her a pushover earlier. She was one of the students that voted in favor of that teacher's pet bitch that they wanted to replace me with; now she doesn't seem all that against me, though.\r\n\r\n\"N-No, but I just—\"\r\n\r\n\"I said, you can only kiss my thighs. And what the fuck did you just do?\" I tsked in disappointment as I looked down on her with a scowl. It didn't take long before tears started to brim her eyes yet again, as a look of panic and regret contorted her features.\r\n\r\n\"I kissed over your panties...\" She answered quietly, sniffing and averting her gaze.\r\n\r\nReaching down, I grab her by the hollow of her cheeks and pulled her attention back onto me. \"Don't you look away from me, baby. Don't you want to look at me? Am I not pretty enough for you, hm? Not scary enough to obey?\"\r\n\r\nShe trips over her words, perking up as her spine steeled over. It was as if she was pushing herself into my hold, wanting to melt into any touch I offer her.\r\n\r\n\"N-No, you're the prettiest girl I-I've ever laid my eyes on! I-I'll do anything you want, please.. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to.. kiss you there... I-I just figured... You looked wet enough for me to... you know..\"\r\n\r\nMy brows raise, my grip on her cheeks loosening as I realize what she had in mind when her eyes averted yet again, words drifting off quietly as her cheeks flushed red.\r\n\r\nThis time, I couldn't help but burst into laughter. Even the blonde was taken aback by my reaction, as my hand slipped from her hair and onto the side of her neck, where it laid idle.\r\n\r\nI lightly and lovingly slap the brunette on her cute cheek. Her brows knitted in confusion as she looked up at me with doe eyes, no longer crying.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, baby. We're not here to fuck. No pussy is gonna be eaten or fingered here, no.\"\r\n\r\nBoth of them physically slump as their eyes glaze over with betrayal and broken hope. I smile at their solemn looks as I tell the brunette to get up on her knees.\r\n\r\nOnce she does, I pull her by the back of her neck and kissed her. Without even taking a second to adjust, her lips willingly part as our tongues clash together.\r\n\r\nTilting my head to the side, my eyes fall closed as I deepen our kiss. She starts making little noises as she presses her body flush against mine, practically pinning me against the wall of the table I was sitting on.\r\n\r\nAs the brunette starts to get a little handsy over my uniform, pinching and pulling on parts she shouldn't be, I push her away. She yelps a little, stumbling on her feet but finds her stability again.\r\n\r\n\"What's that look for?\" I raise a brow, wiping my thumb against my bottom lip to check if there was any blood. The brunette was a pretty bad goddamn kisser if you didn't lead her; I thought she was gonna bite it off at some point. \"Aren't you going to thank me, baby? Blondie over here wanted that kiss from me so bad and you're over there being ungrateful.\" I tutted with a pout.\r\n\r\nAt my words, the brunette stalks back closer to me and starts to thank me. Reaching for my hand and bringing it close to her face.\r\n\r\n\"S-She couldn't even follow your order and she gets a kiss? Are you shitting me right now?\" The blonde stutters from where she sat next to me, grabbing my attention easily as she leans in closer and puts a hand on my cheek.\r\n\r\nLetting her pull me in for a kiss, I don't close my eyes as she tilts her head slightly as her lips meet mine. This kiss was far better than the brunette's; the blonde clearly more experienced as she actually starts using her tongue and matches my pace.\r\n\r\nClosing my eyes, our heads start to bob slowly as she leads the kiss quicker. It was rushed and rough, as my hand found itself tangled in her hair again while her hands caressed my cheek and neck.\r\n\r\n\"C-Can I touch?\"\r\n\r\nIgnoring the brunette as she wraps my legs around her waist, our kiss deepens as I feel someone's hands unbuttoning my blouse, while another pair starts tugging on my hair too. A moan escapes me as I start breathing heavily. \r\n\r\nAfter a while, my eyes snap open and dart towards the door.\r\n\r\n\"Huh..\"\r\n\r\nPulling back, the blonde panted as her eyes flutter open, while the brunette's tongue found one of my nipples. \r\n\r\n\"Something wrong, Crew?\"\r\n\r\nMy eyes bored through the door. Just as I felt eyes boring through me not even a minute ago.\r\n\r\n*I could have sworn someone was watching.* \"Nothing, pretty.\" I smile, leading her closer by the jaw before I feel her lips back on mine.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nAn hour later, I leave 5 minutes after they did. Not bothering to fix my hair or clean the makeup smudges on my neck and thighs as I sigh to myself. Disappointed that I went against my own word.\r\n\r\n*No pussy is gonna be eaten or fingered*, I mentally mock myself as I pop a mint bubblegum in my mouth.\r\n\r\nJust as I was about to go back to class and check if our substitute teacher ever came back— that's when I heard it.\r\n\r\n***Click!***\r\n\r\n\"Hm..\" Stopping in my tracks, I bite back a smile. It just seemed a bit comical, really— considering how easy Hailee is making it for me to corner them. And maybe teach them why they shouldn't conspire against me while I'm at it.\r\n\r\nThey didn't even get close to replacing me, really. Even if I had been coming back from a 12 year sentence, I'd still win against them by a landslide. \r\n\r\n\"You know what my dad used to say to me?\" Turning around, my slow steps resounded in the empty hallway. \r\n\r\nI started making my way towards the storage closet of the dead end corner, where I heard the distinct noise of a cellphone recording. \"He said I'm going to end up in cuffs, one way or another.\"\r\n\r\nStopping in front of the door, I chuckled lowly as my hands reached forward for the doorknob, just to check if they'd also been stupid enough to keep it unlocked. \"I don't know if you using that for blackmail or jerk-off material— either way, you're fucked. 'Cause baby, my own father knew I'm bound to rip a bitch's head off.\" *Or fuck a bitch out. Which one it will be depends entirely on you.*\r\n\r\n*Huh, I just realized.. he probably meant I'll either be a criminal or a whore.*\r\n\r\n\"Unlock the door, baby. I won't bite...\" *much*. \r\n\r\n*I guess it's time to make daddy proud.*\"\r\n","As if she wasn't tragic enough— here, Mitzi falls from grace.
