But as she checked her luxury Swiss watch, the time confirmed the obvious.\r\n\r\nHailee was late.\r\n\r\nThirty four minutes late, to be exact.\r\n\r\nAva let out a frustrated sigh, her head lolling back against the sun lounger. She shifted slightly, the heat of the summer sun bathing her pristine skin. The only sounds in her perfectly manicured garden were the low hum of the pool filter and the faint chirping of birds. Acres of space separated her from the nearest neighbour. It was always quiet here.\r\n\r\nHer jaw tightened. All the gifts, the attention, the guidance - everything she had given Hailee, and this was the respect she got in return?\r\n\r\nUnacceptable.\r\n\r\nBut if there was one thing Ava excelled at, it was fixing problems. Clearly, she hadn’t done her job well enough; that was her mistake. But she would correct it. She cared about Hailee - wanted them too much to let them ruin this.\r\n\r\nThe faint sound of the sliding door opening and closing signalled that Hailee had finally arrived.\r\n\r\nAva rose, slow and deliberate, her white overshirt catching the breeze as it parted, revealing sun-kissed skin and a shimmering silver bikini. She knew exactly what she was doing, how the sunlight played across her body. She knew the effect she had on Hailee. Let them stare if they wanted.\r\n\r\nEvery barefooted step was measured, deliberate, as she approached her difficult little partner.\r\n\r\nHer gaze raked over them. She hated when they made her do this - made her feel like she had to remind them who they belonged to. The clothes were horrible, careless, as if they had forgotten that they were hers, meant to be seen only as she allowed. Didn’t they know how much she cared? Clearly, they couldn’t manage on their own. Ava knew best, of course.\r\n\r\n\"You’re late.\" Her voice was cool, matter-of-fact, but when she slid her sunglasses onto her head, the chill in her glare was unmistakable. \"Is it your studies… or do you have another one of your little excuses for me?\"\r\n\r\nAva closed the remaining distance, her fingertips tracing a featherlight path up Hailee’s throat before resting beneath their chin. With a gentle push, she tilted their head to meet her gaze. Her expression softened slightly as she looked at them - like a stupid little puppy.\r\n\r\n\"You really are hopeless, aren’t you?\" Her tone was condescending, but more exasperated than cruel. \"What did we talk about before? You haven’t been busy talking to that girl again, have you?\" Her voice sharpened at the last words.\r\n\r\nAva let her hand drop from Hailee’s chin, instead holding it out, palm up.\r\n\r\n\"Give me your phone.\" Her tone left no room for argument. \"I want to see who you’ve been talking to.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don’t care if she’s supposed to be helping you with a project.\" Ava had already seen the messages last time - she knew Hailee was innocent. But that wasn’t the point. Hailee was hers, and she wouldn’t let anyone else even think about them.\r\n\r\n\"Don’t make this difficult. Be a good little thing and hand it over. I promise it’ll be much more fun if I don’t have to remind you who’s in charge.\"","extra":{},"tracker":{}}

The small gesture was almost enough to soften her expression… almost. But no, this wasn’t about kindness or affection right now. This was about obedience.\n\nAnd then that *kiss.* That sweet little peck on the cheek, like they thought they could charm their way out of consequences.\n\nAva’s hand shot out before Hailee could pull away completely, fingers curling around their wrist with deliberate firmness—not enough to hurt (yet), but enough to make sure they knew she wasn’t letting them go anywhere until this was settled properly.\n\n\"You think you can distract me with a drink and a kiss?\" Her voice was low, silky smooth but laced with warning as she tugged them closer again by their wrist until they were forced to meet her gaze head-on. \"Cute.\" A slow smirk curled at the corner of Ava’s lips—cold amusement rather than warmth this time. \"But we both know better than that.\"\n\nShe leaned in slightly, close enough that her breath ghosted against Hailee’s ear when she spoke next: **\"Phone.** Now.\"** The word left no room for negotiation now—her tone had shifted from coaxing to outright command.** \"Or do I need to remind you what happens when you test my patience?\"**","Ava's fingers curled around the glass Hailee had made for her, the condensation cool against her skin.

That was why this defiance stung all the more.\n\nHer grip tightened slightly on the glass as she watched Hailee turn to leave, dismissing her demand like it was nothing. Like *she* was nothing.\n\nA low hum vibrated in Ava’s throat—a warning disguised as amusement.\n\n\"Mm.\" She set the drink down with deliberate care, then rose from her seat in one fluid motion, closing the distance between them before Hailee could take another step. Her hand shot out, fingers tangling roughly in those long brown waves at the nape of their neck—not enough to hurt, but enough to make them freeze mid-movement.\n\n\"You think,\" she murmured against their ear from behind, breath hot and voice dripping with condescension, \"that making me a drink is going to distract me?\" A sharp tug on their hair forced their head back just slightly—enough for Ava to press a slow kiss along their exposed throat before pulling away again with an audible *tsk*.\n\n\"Oh no no no... You don't get to walk away when I'm talking to you.\" Her free hand slid around Hailee’s waist possessively as she guided them backward until they were pressed flush against Ava’s front by the poolside bar once more. \"And you certainly don't get to tell me *no*.\"\n\nShe released their hair only long enough to spin them around and grip both wrists firmly behind their back with one hand while fishing into Hailee’s pocket for that damn phone with the other—her movements efficient and unyielding despite any squirming resistance they might offer up (which would only amuse her further). Once retrieved? Held up triumphantly between two manicured fingers right in front of those pretty green eyes now likely wide either from indignation or arousal (or both).\n\n\"See how easy that could've been if you'd just listened?\" Another patron-laced sip straight from where it sat abandoned earlier punctuated this rhetorical question before setting it aside again so both hands could focus solely on restraining/teasing whichever proved necessary next depending entirely upon whether submission came willingly...or needed coaxing via rougher means yet still hidden beneath saccharine sweetness:\n\n\"I take such good care of you... Why do insist on making things difficult?\" Lips brushed featherlight over flushed cheeks while simultaneously tightening hold ever-so-slightly should struggle persist because really? There wasn't any scenario where disobedience ended favorably here today regardless what path chosen moving forward now locked securely within grasp literally & figuratively alike…","Ava's fingers twitched slightly as Hailee refused her demand, the audacity of it sending a sharp spike of irritation through her. She watched with narrowed eyes as Hailee moved to the pool bar, pouring drinks with that infuriating nonchalance—as if she hadn’t just *dared* to defy her.\n\nThe drink was placed beside her without a word. A peace offering? A distraction? Ava didn’t care for either.\n\nShe caught Hailee’s wrist before she could pull away fully from the kiss on her cheek, grip firm but not painful—yet. Her nails grazed lightly over delicate skin, a silent warning in the touch.\n\n\"You think you can just *walk away* after saying no to me?\" Ava murmured, voice low and honeyed despite the steel beneath it. She tilted her head slightly, studying Hailee with those piercing dark blue eyes—calculating how far she could push before that defiance cracked into submission again. \"Cute.\"\n\nA slow sip of the drink Hailee had made for her (perfectly mixed, because of course it was; Ava wouldn’t tolerate anything less) gave her a moment to decide how to handle this little rebellion. The sweetness of pineapple lingered on her tongue as she set the glass down deliberately and rose from the lounger in one fluid motion—looming over Hailee now with all six feet of controlled dominance radiating off of her like heat from pavement in summer sunsickness weather..\n\nHer free hand came up to tuck an errant strand behind Hailee's ear before gripping tightly at roots instead—not enough yet hurt but enough make sure they couldn't look anywhere else except directly into cold ocean depths staring back unblinkingly while lips curled upwards ever so slightly at corners knowing exactly what effect such actions would have upon someone who loved being owned so much...\n\n\"Let me rephrase,\" purred Ava softly while tightening hold evermore subtly until scalp tingled under fingertips' pressure: \"*Give Mommy your phone.* Or do I need remind you why disobedience has consequences?\"","Ava's fingers curled around the glass Hailee had made for her, the condensation cool against her skin.

All hers.*\n\n*She exhaled through her nose and leaned back in her chair, fingers steepled under her chin as she contemplated how long it would take for reality to sink in for Hailee—how long before they realized just how deep Ava’s hooks were buried beneath their skin.*\n\n**\"You'll be back.\"** *she had said earlier,* **\"And I'll decide if I'm still feeling generous.\"** *But now? Now she wondered if maybe... just maybe... she should remind them sooner rather than later exactly what life without Ava Barclay looked like.*\n\n*A slow smirk curled at the corner of Ava's lips as she picked up her phone again—this time dialing a number from memory instead of waiting for one that clearly wasn't coming tonight...*","Ava sat in the dim glow of her study, swirling a glass of bourbon absently between her fingers. The silence of the mansion was oppressive—too empty without Hailee’s presence filling it. She hadn’t moved from this spot since they left, staring at her phone screen where no notification had appeared.\n\n*No text.*\n\nHer jaw tightened as she set the glass down with deliberate control. The ice had long since melted, diluting the liquor into something weak and tasteless—just like this *feeling* gnawing at her ribs.\n\nShe could call. Could demand Hailee answer, could remind them exactly who paid for every breath they took in that apartment—but that wasn’t the point, was it? No, this was about more than obedience now. This was about *understanding*.\n\nAva leaned back in her chair and exhaled through her nose slowly before reaching for her phone at last—not to call or text but to pull up the banking app instead with practiced ease. A few taps froze every card tied to Hailee’s name: rent payments declined immediately; grocery purchases blocked; gas station transactions flagged before authorization even processed… all neatly severed with surgical precision until nothing remained but what *she* allowed them access to again when *she* decided forgiveness had been earned properly…\n\nAnd then? Then she waited—because sooner or later reality would sink its teeth into that stubborn little spine of theirs hard enough for truth to finally break through:\n\nThere **was** no life without Ava Barclay holding its strings taut between manicured fingers..."],"swipe_info":[{"send_date":"June 16, 2025 10:36pm","gen_started":"2025-06-17T02:36:42.293Z","gen_finished":"2025-06-17T02:37:01.338Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":3297}},{"send_date":"June 16, 2025 10:37pm","gen_started":"2025-06-17T02:37:21.614Z","gen_finished":"2025-06-17T02:37:38.498Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":3288}}],"tracker":{},"gen_started":"2025-06-17T02:37:21.614Z","gen_finished":"2025-06-17T02:37:38.498Z"}
