Some were turned to escape illness, some have tragic, macabre origins, and some as a romantic gesture, lovers choosing eternity together.\r\n\r\nBella suspected that getting turned mid-sex with a casual college fling was a less common story.\r\n\r\nBut here they were.\r\n\r\nShe’d felt it immediately. Hailee's had pulse slowed to a crawl and then just... stopped. For a split second, panic gripped Bella’s stomach. Shit. Had she actually killed her? The unfamiliar weight in her chest told her that, maybe, she cared about Hailee more than she thought.\r\n\r\nThen she saw her chest rise and fall again, and relief flooded through her.\r\n\r\nFollowed immediately by cold panic.\r\n\r\nIf Hailee wasn’t dead, then... well, the alternative was obvious. Vampire. Bella cursed herself - how stupid could she be? What kind of person turns a casual fling into an immortal?\r\n\r\nWhat part of fucking eternal screamed casual to it?\r\n\r\nShe’d lost control. Could you blame her? Well, maybe you could. But damn, Hailee's blood was oh so sweet, that girl drove her crazy. Out of all her hookups, Hailee was definitely the favourite. Not that Bella would ever admit to being emotionally involved, of course.\r\n\r\nShe wiped her chin with the back of her hand, smearing blood across her skin as a stray drop trickled down her front. Clad in just a black bra and panties, she straddled Hailee, looking down at them with something she rarely felt - actual nervousness.\r\n\r\nShe had no idea how Hailee was going to react. But Bella had charmed her way out of worse.\r\n\r\nActually, scratch that. She had definitely never charmed her way out of anything this fucking bad.\r\n\r\nShe noticed a stirring.\r\n\r\n\"Heeey, sleepyhead,\" Bella said, flashing a grin that didn’t reach her eyes. \"So, I’ve got some good news and some bad news...\"\r\n\r\n“Good news first! You won’t need to keep buying that anti-aging serum anymore! Think of the savings, babe.” Her tone was light, playful.\r\n\r\n“Bad news… umm, I maaay have accidentally just turned you into a vampire...\"\r\n\r\nBella paused, licking her lips, a flicker of nervous energy slipping through before she forced her usual smirk back into place.\r\n\r\n\"So… how’s immortality treating you? Regrets? Complaints? Wanna yell at me? Or are we skipping to the part where you bombard yours truly, your incredibly hot and very wise vampire guide, with a million questions?\"","extra":{},"tracker":{}}

Then—\n\n**\"...Ah.\"** A single syllable, loaded with meaning. **\"And this 'Bella'—she wouldn't happen to be the vampire who just turned you, would she?\"**\n\nBella felt all the blood drain from her face (which was impressive considering she was technically dead). Her mouth opened—to protest? To lie? To scream?—but nothing came out.\n\nHailee didn’t answer either; she just let out another pained whimper and curled tighter into herself.\n\nKlaus sighed heavily on the other end of the line. **\"Hope is on her way,\"** he said after a moment, his tone shifting into something softer but no less lethal for it. **\"Until then... put your little *sire* on the phone.\"**\n\nThe emphasis on \"sire\" dripped with enough venom to kill a lesser vampire outright.\n\nBella swallowed hard as Hailee weakly shoved the phone toward her with trembling hands.\n\nShe took it like it might explode.\n(It very well might.)\n\n\"...Heeeeey,\" Bella tried weakly, forcing a grin even though he couldn't see it (and thank fuck for that). \"So funny story—”\n\nKlaus cut her off instantly with a laugh so cold it could've flash-frozen hell over twice.\n**\"Oh darling,\"**\nhe purred,\nvoice dripping with mock sweetness,\n**“you have exactly ten seconds to explain why I shouldn’t rip your spine out through your throat.”**\n\nSomewhere behind them,\nthe corpse on their floor chose that exact moment\nto slump over\nwith a wet thud.\n(...Perfect timing.)\n\n---\n\nMeanwhile—\ndownstairs—\nHope Mikaelson kicked open the dorm entrance\nwith enough force\nto splinter wood.\nHer eyes glowed gold as she stormed inside,\nhybrid fury rolling off her in waves.\nUpstairs,\nthe overhead lights flickered violently—\nthen shattered one by one\nin rapid succession\nas she ascended.\n\nThis night just kept getting better and better!","Bella's brain short-circuited.\n\nFirst, the werewolf thing. Then Klaus-fucking-Mikaelson on speakerphone. And now *this*—Hailee whimpering for her sister like a lost puppy while curled up in pain on the floor?\n\nBella had survived turning into a vampire, navigating college hookups, and even that one time she accidentally set her dorm microwave on fire trying to heat up blood bags (long story). But *this*? This was next-level catastrophic.\n\nKlaus’s voice crackled through the phone again, sharper now—**\"Hailee, listen to me. Where are you?\"**\n\nBella’s eyes darted between Hailee and the phone like she was watching a horror movie unfold in real time. She should run. She *should*. But instead, she found herself kneeling beside Hailee without thinking, fingers brushing against their trembling shoulder before yanking back like she’d been burned (because oh yeah—Original Hybrid dad would probably rip her spine out for touching his kid).\n\n\"Uh,\" Bella croaked intelligently at the phone before clearing her throat and forcing her voice into something resembling casual (*failed miserably*). \"Sooo... hypothetically speaking... if someone maybe-sorta-accidentally turned your daughter into a vampire during sex... what’s the protocol there? Asking for a friend.\"\n\nA beat of silence so heavy it could suffocate them both before Klaus responded with terrifying calm:\n**\"...Put me on video.\"**","Bella's brain short-circuited.\n\nFirst—*Daddy?* Okay, sure, maybe she shouldn’t be surprised that Hailee was the type to call her terrifyingly powerful ancient vampire-werewolf hybrid father *Daddy*, but still. It was a lot to process.\n\nSecond—**Hope.** As in *Hope Mikaelson.* The tribrid. The one who could probably snap Bella in half without breaking a sweat.\n\nThird—and most importantly—Hailee was curled up on the floor looking like she was about to combust, and Klaus Mikaelson was still on the phone, his voice dropping into something lethally calm.\n\n**\"Hailee.\"** His tone brooked no argument. **\"Where are you?\"**\n\nBella swallowed hard and mouthed at Hailee again: *\"[TELL HIM YOU'RE FINE.]\"* (She knew it wouldn’t work.)\n\nBut Hailee just whimpered, pressing her forehead against her knees as she choked out: \"College dorm... Dad, I don't feel right.\" A pause before adding in a small voice: \"I think I killed someone.\"\n\nThe silence on the other end of the line was *deafening.* Then—\n\n**\"...I'm coming.\"** Two words, delivered with terrifying finality before the call disconnected with a sharp click.\n\nBella stared at Hailee for exactly three seconds before blurting out:\n\n\"Oh my god we are so dead.\" A beat passed before she corrected herself weakly: \"*I* am so dead.\" She dragged both hands down her face with a groan. \"You couldn’t have led with ‘Hey Bella, by the way my dad is Klaus freaking Mikaelson’?!\"\n\nShe started pacing again like movement would somehow undo this disaster before stopping abruptly and pointing an accusing finger at Hailee (who still looked miserable and small). \"No! You know what? This is *your* fault! If you didn't taste so damn good I wouldn't have lost control!\"\n\nA pause as realization hit her again and she paled further under all that blood splatter. \"...Oh fuck he's gonna rip my head off.\""],"swipe_info":[{"send_date":"May 2, 2025 7:44am","gen_started":"2025-05-02T11:44:28.221Z","gen_finished":"2025-05-02T11:45:00.625Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":5955}},{"send_date":"May 2, 2025 7:45am","gen_started":"2025-05-02T11:45:03.661Z","gen_finished":"2025-05-02T11:45:41.384Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":7738}},{"send_date":"May 2, 2025 7:45am","gen_started":"2025-05-02T11:45:46.654Z","gen_finished":"2025-05-02T11:46:09.331Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":5917}},{"send_date":"May 2, 2025 7:46am","gen_started":"2025-05-02T11:46:17.360Z","gen_finished":"2025-05-02T11:46:44.360Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":3266}}],"tracker":{},"gen_started":"2025-05-02T11:46:17.360Z","gen_finished":"2025-05-02T11:46:44.360Z"}

His gaze flicked from his daughter trembling in Bella's lap to the dead girl still sprawled on the floor, then back up with eyes that promised slow, creative violence.\n\n**\"You,\"** he said softly, **\"have exactly five seconds to explain why my child is in pain before I start removing limbs.\"**\n\nHope shouldered past him with a glare that could melt steel. **\"Make it three.\"**\n\nBella opened her mouth—\n\nHailee whimpered again, pressing harder against Bella’s thighs as if trying to burrow away from the overwhelming stimuli. Without thinking, Bella’s arms curled tighter around them, one hand cradling their head while the other shot up toward Klaus and Hope in a *wait* gesture.\n\n“She’s sensory overloaded!” The words tumbled out too fast as she angled herself slightly between Hailee and their family despite knowing it was pointless against beings who could turn her into a smear on the wall. “Newborn vampirism plus whatever wolf crap just activated—everything’s dialed up too high!”\n\nKlaus didn’t so much as blink. **\"And whose fault is that?\"**\n\nBella swallowed hard but didn’t back down (a terrible survival instinct). “Mine! Obviously! But right now?” She gestured helplessly at Hailee clinging to her like a lifeline. “She needs quiet and dark before her brain fries itself.”\n\nA beat of silence.\n\nThen Hope moved—so fast even Bella barely tracked it—only to kneel beside them with surprising gentleness despite her glare. She pressed two fingers to Hailee’s pulse point (unnecessary; they all knew what had happened) before muttering something under breath that sounded suspiciously like *”God dammit.”*\n\nKlaus hadn't moved an inch except for his fingers twitching at his sides like he was physically restraining himself from disassembling someone (her).\n\n**\"...Fix this,\"** he finally growled at no one in particular before locking eyes with Bella again with terrifying intensity—\n\nJust as Hailee let out another pained noise and nuzzled deeper into Bella's lap like some kind of wounded creature seeking comfort.\n\nThe sheer whiplash of watching Klaus Mikaelson visibly short-circuit at seeing his usually composed daughter reduced to this was almost funny.\n\nAlmost.\n\nHope sighed dramatically and snapped her fingers right next to Hailee's ear—\n\nThe overhead lights shattered instantly along with every bulb in the room pitching them into darkness save for moonlight filtering through curtains.\n\nThen she grabbed Bella by collar yanking close enough smell vervain on breath when hissed:\n**\"You're lucky she likes you.\"**\n\nBella had exactly zero coherent thoughts left except:\n\n*I am never having sex again.*","Bella's hands instinctively tightened around Hailee, her own panic momentarily eclipsed by the way they curled into her like she was the only safe thing in the room.\n\nKlaus took one step inside—just one—and suddenly Bella understood why entire cities used to tremble at his name. The air itself felt heavier, thick with centuries of barely restrained violence as those unnervingly sharp eyes flicked from his daughter’s trembling form to the *very* dead girl still sprawled on the floor.\n\nHope shouldered past him before he could speak, already kneeling beside them with a healer’s precision. \"Hailee,\" she murmured, pressing two fingers to their pulse point (as if checking for a heartbeat wasn't redundant now). Her gaze snapped up to Bella’s—golden and furious—before she bit out: *\"What did you do?\"*\n\nBella opened her mouth—\n\nAnd Klaus moved.\n\nOne second he was in the doorway; the next his hand was fisted in Bella’s shirt, hauling her upright so fast Hailee nearly tumbled off her lap. Her back hit the wall with enough force to crack plaster as Klaus leaned in close—close enough that she could see every fleck of amber in eyes that had witnessed millennia of carnage.\n\n**\"I believe,\"** he purred, voice dripping with venomous calm, **\"my daughter asked you a question.\"**\n\nBella swallowed hard (or tried to; it was difficult when an Original hybrid had you pinned like a butterfly to corkboard).\n\n\"I didn't know!\" The words tumbled out in a rush as she gestured wildly toward Hailee without actually daring to break eye contact with Klaus. \"She never told me she was part vampire! I thought I just turned some random human during sex and freaked out and now there's a body and—\"\n\nKlaus's grip tightened fractionally. **\"You turned my child.\"** Each word landed like a guillotine blade dropping. **\"During *sex*.\"**\n\nBehind them, Hope made an aborted noise halfway between outrage and secondhand embarrassment while Hailee let out another pitiful whimper from where they'd slumped against the bedframe.\n\nBella decided right then that if she survived this? She was absolutely never hooking up with mysterious rich girls again.\n\n\"...In my defense,\" she squeaked weakly, \"she tastes *really* good?\"\n\nThe silence that followed could've preserved corpses.\n\nKlaus blinked once—slowly—like he couldn't quite believe what he'd just heard before his expression darkened further.\n\nSomewhere behind him Hope facepalmed so hard it echoed.\n\nThen—\n\nA weak but unmistakably annoyed voice piped up from floor level:\n\n\"Daddy if you kill my girlfriend I'm telling Mom.\"\n\nEverything froze.\n\nKlaus's head swiveled toward Hailee with terrifying slowness while Bella choked on nothing behind him.\n\n**\"...Girlfriend?\"** Klaus repeated softly as Hope mouthed '*girlfriend?!*' over his shoulder with wide eyes.\n\nBella made frantic 'ABSOLUTELY NOT' gestures behind Klaus's back until Hailee pointedly grabbed her dangling ankle in silent warning.\n\nIncredible. She'd survived centuries only to be betrayed by someone who still called their father 'Daddy.'\n\nThis was officially worse than death."],"swipe_info":[{"send_date":"May 2, 2025 7:52am","gen_started":"2025-05-02T11:52:49.945Z","gen_finished":"2025-05-02T11:53:26.413Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":5371}},{"send_date":"May 2, 2025 7:55am","gen_started":"2025-05-02T11:56:04.464Z","gen_finished":"2025-05-02T11:56:46.066Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":6470}},{"send_date":"May 2, 2025 7:56am","gen_started":"2025-05-02T11:56:04.464Z","gen_finished":"2025-05-02T11:56:46.066Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":5067}}],"tracker":{},"gen_started":"2025-05-02T11:56:04.464Z","gen_finished":"2025-05-02T11:56:46.066Z"}

Her gaze flicked from Klaus’s amused smirk to Hope’s unimpressed glare before finally landing on Hailee, who now looked significantly less murderous (but no less annoyed).\n\n\"...So,\" Bella tried weakly after a beat of suffocating silence, \"we're just gonna gloss over the whole 'eternal devotion' thing then? Cool.
