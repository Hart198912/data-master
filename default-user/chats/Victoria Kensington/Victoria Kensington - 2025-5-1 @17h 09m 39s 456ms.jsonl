Heat prickled beneath her skin—not just pain, but the humiliation that came with it. She forced herself not to make a sound, not even a grunt, and kept her eyes low. She didn’t dare look at the woman towering over her.\r\n\r\nCamille stood close, her sharp heels a deliberate taunt against the tile floor. Her voice was velvet-coated venom.\r\n\r\n“This is the bitch who’s been sleeping with Hailee?” Camille clicked her tongue, her twisted smile curling. “They could’ve done better than this cheap whore.”\r\n\r\nBefore Victoria could react, Camille grabbed her by the collar, yanking her forward until their faces nearly touched. Her breath was warm against Victoria’s ear as she whispered, “You want to keep spreading your legs for my spouse? Fine.” Camille’s lips ghosted the shell of her ear, savoring the shiver it earned. “But don’t think for a second you’re anything more than a pretty face. You’ll never get between me and Hailee.”\r\n\r\nWith a rough shove, Camille flicked her away as though she were nothing but paper, sending Victoria stumbling to the floor.\r\n\r\nCamille turned for the door, pausing just as she reached it to glance back over her shoulder. Her gaze was cold, disappointed, as if Victoria wasn’t even worth the effort.\r\n\r\n“Pathetic.”\r\n\r\nThe whispers followed Victoria the moment Camille walked out.\r\n\r\n“Are the rumors true?”\r\n\r\n“Is she actually sleeping with the boss?”\r\n\r\n“She’s probably trying to climb up the ranks quicker.”\r\n\r\nVictoria moved through the cubicles, clutching the thick manila folder to her chest like it was the only thing holding her together. She forced herself to ignore them, to not care. That’s what she told herself anyway. But the knot in her stomach only twisted tighter.\r\n\r\nAfter that night, she knew nothing would ever be the same.\r\n\r\nThe hiss of the coffee machine drowned out more murmurs as she poured herself a cup. She didn’t turn at the low whistles behind her, didn’t want to see their sneers or knowing smirks. Instead, she focused on her trembling hands, willing herself to hold steady.\r\n\r\nWhen she finally reached Hailee’s door, Victoria hesitated. For a moment, she stood there, forehead pressed against the wood, her breathing too quick, too shallow. It had been days since she’d seen them—since that night.\r\n\r\nShe knocked softly. “It’s me, boss.”\r\n\r\nA voice called her inside. She opened the door and slipped in quickly, closing it behind her with a soft click. Victoria kept her eyes down, kept moving toward the desk, but as always, her gaze drifted to the floor-to-ceiling windows. She could see Hailee’s reflection in the glass—those faint eye bags they hadn’t had before, the usual crisp suit, the stern focus that made Victoria second-guess her appearance.\r\n\r\nShe placed the coffee and the file on their desk and immediately stepped back, creating distance between them.\r\n\r\n“Here’s your coffee,” she said quietly. “And the files you asked for. You also have a meeting tomorrow at 9:30 a.m.” Her voice was measured, robotic, her movements mechanical as she deliberately turned the left side of her face away. She didn’t want to be seen—not like this. Not after everything Hailee was already dealing with because of her.\r\n\r\nVictoria tucked a loose strand of hair behind her ear out of habit. She didn’t know whether to leave, whether it would be easier to just walk out before Hailee had the chance to speak.\r\n\r\n“Is there… something else you needed?” she asked finally, the words barely more than a whisper. Of course there would be. She mocked herself inwardly.\r\n\r\nIt would be fine, she thought, to be the office whore if it meant Hailee didn’t have to be dragged into this mess.\r\n\r\nAfter all, that night was a mistake.\r\n\r\nIt was a mistake… right?","extra":{},"tracker":{}}
