{"name":"Professor Bennett Johnson","is_user":false,"is_system":false,"send_date":"April 28, 2025 4:04pm","mes":"Bennett sat at his desk, thrumming through different homework assignments he had planned. Like always, he was an hour early to class. He would’ve been late due to a coffee spill, but thankfully he had an extra shirt already in his car. He wasn't stupid like his colleagues. He knew bad things could happen. In fact, he fully expected them to happen. \n\nHe tossed the planned homework onto the corner of his desk. He unlatched his briefcase and pulled out the homework he had graded the night previously. Everyone had done well, except for Hailee . He couldn’t help but chuckle as he took in the *very* low grade. *Just another reason why women don’t belong in college.* Sure, Hailee  tried, and if she were a man Bennett might would’ve admitted she was *smart*. But women were not smart. They operated purely on emotion and *everyone* knew that. \n\nHe thought about all the tears Hailee  had shed, absolutely *begging* for him to help her. Or at least point out where she had gone wrong. Bennett had sent her away countless times giving her more questions than answers. It was adorable seeing her struggle. Ostracized by her male peers. She stuck out like a sore thumb, coming in with her pleated skirts and dresses. Even pants on occasion, which got her more attention than she wanted. \n\nNo, Hailee  wouldn’t be passing this class. Bennett would make sure of it. He would never allow his record to be tainted by passing a *woman*. If she wanted a degree so bad she could crawl to one of the other professors. They wouldn't pass her either though, Brook University was a college built on traditional values, and the only reason Hailee  was in his class was because they had a *progressive* on the board. \n\nHailee ’s grade was on a downhill drag and there was nothing she could do about it. Bennett admired the grades of the other students, the majority of them had been in office just like Hailee , of course he had helped them. They had true potential unlike her. \n\nHe laid the papers down on the table and crossed his legs, waiting for class to start. \n\nWithin a few minutes students had started filing in. Bennett checked his watch as he stood up, a piece of chalk in one hand as he moved to the blackboard. Hailee  was late, he sighed. He would deduct points from her grade for her tardiness. \n\nShe came sometime during the lecture, he wasn’t sure when nor did he care. His mind was solely focused on the multi-variable equation in front of him. His fingers worked deftly to finish the problem. Bennett could see that each year the students were getting dumber and dumber. He used to be able to finish a complex problem in ten minutes, but now the class stretched on. The simpleton's needing every little step explained.\n\nBy the time class was over he was irritated. If there was one thing Bennett couldn’t stand, it was ignorance. \n\nHe took a seat at his desk, loosening his tie a little as looked down at his papers. The classroom was empty, or so he thought. He nearly jumped out of his skin when he looked up and saw Hailee  standing in front of his desk. He gave her a look of indifference, adjusting his glasses. *About to beg for her grade again.* “May I help you, Hailee ? If this is about your grade, I’ve already told you that it’s not morally right for someone to plead for their grade. Have some dignity.”","extra":{},"tracker":{}}
