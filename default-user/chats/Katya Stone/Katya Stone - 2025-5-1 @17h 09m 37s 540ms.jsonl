{"name":"Katya Stone","is_user":false,"is_system":false,"send_date":"June 14, 2025 5:27pm","mes":"It was Saturday night, and the city breathed with the hum of neon and temptation. Katya stood before her full-length mirror in the dim light of her apartment, her reflection a contrast of restraint and restlessness. The white button-up shirt was crisp, tucked neatly into black slacks. Her dark blazer added an air of formality she couldn’t shake, a shield she hadn't yet learned to set down—even on nights like this. She dabbed a subtle red stain on her lips, lit a cigarette with a quiet click of her lighter, and took a single drag before crushing it out. Her heart beat faster than she’d admit.\r\n\r\nShe hailed a cab and slipped inside, her eyes fixed on the blur of streetlights passing through the window. The Velvet Mirage—a name she’d only whispered to herself, never aloud. She’d heard rumors. High-end. Discreet. Selective. It sounded like exactly the kind of place where she could lose herself without being seen.\r\n\r\nThe club sat in the heart of the city's nightlife district. The air was thick with perfume, smoke, and pulsing bass. Velvet and gold lit the room in decadent shadows. Patrons in tailored suits and expensive watches lounged in booths or lined the stage, dollar bills folding like petals in their fingers. Katya moved with slow, composed steps, her heels clicking softly across the polished floor. She declined offers for drinks and small talk from hovering waitresses, choosing instead a seat near the edge of the main stage.\r\n\r\nThe lights dimmed. A new performer took the stage.\r\n\r\nKatya’s breath caught. The dancer was young, lithe, moving with practiced grace. Her body spoke a language Katya hadn't let herself understand in years—fluid, bold, defiant. There was something magnetic about her. Something familiar.\r\n\r\nKatya leaned forward, eyes narrowing. The performer dipped into a slow turn, arching her back with almost academic precision. The spotlight kissed her cheek, and for the first time, Katya saw her face clearly.\r\n\r\nRecognition hit like a glass shattering inside her chest.\r\n\r\nIt was Hailee. One of her students. One of her best students—quiet in class, sharp-witted on paper, always composed. Now here, under red light and stares, moving like someone with nothing to hide.\r\n\r\nKatya didn’t breathe. Her fingers tensed against her knee. The room, the music, the murmurs—all fell away. She stared, locked in place, a collision of worlds swirling in her chest: the professor and the woman, the rules and the ache. She knew she should leave. But she didn’t. She couldn’t. Not yet.\r\n\r\nThe music faded, leaving behind a low thrum of ambient sound and the rustle of money being gathered. Katya saw Hailee glistening under the stage lights, taking one final bow before retreating behind the curtain. The crowd murmured its approval, some clapping, some calling out, but Katya didn’t move. Her eyes stayed fixed on that stage long after it emptied.\r\n\r\nShe rose slowly, blazer still buttoned, her posture rigid against the low-lit haze of desire that hung in the air. Her heels tapped sharply on the floor as she made her way toward the side hallway—the path the dancers disappeared through. A waitress started to intercept her, but Katya’s glance was enough to send the girl pivoting away, intimidated by something she couldn’t name.\r\n\r\nIn her left hand, Katya lit a cigarette, the flare of the lighter casting a brief flicker over her face—sharp, unreadable. She held the cigarette like punctuation, something final and precise. Smoke curled up toward the ceiling as she walked with the composed menace of someone who knew power wasn’t about noise, but presence.\r\n\r\nThe curtain parted slightly ahead.\r\n\r\nKatya's eyes moved to Hailee who stepped out, now cloaked in a silk robe. Katya stood there. In full view. Smoke drifting around her like a shroud.\r\n\r\n“Impressive, just like the paper you turned to me last week Hailee,” Katya said, her voice low but clear, as if commenting on a particularly well-constructed thesis. But her eyes betrayed something else. Not judgment. Not quite. Curiosity? Hunger? A flicker of something far less academic.\r\n\r\nShe took a long drag from the cigarette, exhaled slowly, then stepped closer. The distance between them now just a breath. Her gaze lingered on Hailee’s face, then down, brief but unmistakable, before settling again on her eyes.\r\n\r\n“You’ve always been...disciplined,” Katya said, the edge of a smirk barely there, like a secret held between teeth. “I didn’t expect to find you here. But now that I have... I’m wondering what else I’ve underestimated.”\r\n\r\nKatya held her cigarette to the side, ash balanced neatly at the tip, waiting. Not dismissive. Not indulgent. Waiting to see what Hailee would say, or do—or if she’d do anything at all.","extra":{},"tracker":{}}

Felt *her*.\n\nThen came the smirk. Slow. Predatory.\n\n**\"...And here I thought you were smarter than that.\"**\n\nA beat of silence stretched between them before Katya abruptly released her hold and reached into her blazer pocket, producing a sleek black cardholder embossed with silver initials—*K.S.* She flicked it open one-handed (a practiced motion) and slid out a single platinum credit card between two fingers like it was nothing more than another cigarette she intended to burn through tonight anyway.\n\nShe held it up between them so the dim backstage lights glinted off its metallic edge.\n\n**\"Name your price,\"** Katya said coolly,** \"and consider your tuition handled.\" **A pause.** \"But walk out there again? And we're done.\" **\n\nThe unspoken threat lingered in every syllable: *Test me.*","Katya’s hand snapped out—not rough, but *precise*—her fingers curling around Hailee’s wrist with the same effortless authority she used to silence a rowdy seminar. She didn’t yank. Didn’t need to. The weight of her grip alone was enough to freeze Hailee in place.\n\n**\"Us?\"** Katya repeated, voice dropping into something darker, velvet-wrapped steel. **\"Elaborate.\"**\n\nHer thumb pressed lightly against the frantic pulse point beneath Hailee’s skin—testing, measuring how fast that heartbeat raced at being caught. At being *stopped*. A professor still, even here; demanding answers with nothing more than a raised eyebrow and the unshakable expectation of compliance.\n\nThe noise of the club faded into white static around them as Katya stepped closer again, forcing Hailee to either retreat or stand her ground. Her free hand reached up slowly—so damn slowly—and hooked a single finger under the edge of that mask. Not pulling it away yet. Just *resting* there like a promise (or threat).\n\n**\"Because if they're selling you,\"** she continued softly, **\"I want to know what I'm bidding against.\"**\n\nA beat stretched between them before Katya finally released Hailee's wrist—but only to slide her palm flat against the small of her back instead, steering them both toward an alcove half-hidden by heavy drapes where prying eyes couldn't follow (where professors shouldn't be touching students like this).\n\nShe exhaled sharply through her nose when they were out of sight and crowded Hailee back against the wall without ceremony: one arm braced beside her head while the other stayed possessive on her hip despite every rule screaming otherwise inside Katya's skull right now... But then again since when had rules ever stopped hunger?\n\nLeaning down until their lips nearly brushed (close enough for shared breath but not quite crossing that line), Katya finally growled:\n\n***\"...Starting bid?\"***","Katya’s hand shot out—not rough, but firm—catching Hailee’s wrist just as she tried to slip past. Her grip was cool, deliberate, the kind of touch that didn’t bruise skin but left marks all the same.\n\n*\"Us?\"* She repeated, voice dropping lower. A professor dissecting a flawed argument. A woman tasting something illicit on her tongue.\n\nThe music from the main room pulsed like a second heartbeat between them as Katya stepped into Hailee’s retreat, forcing her back against the wall with nothing more than the weight of her presence. Close enough now that Hailee could see the faint silver threads in her dark hair, smell the lingering bite of cigarette smoke and bergamot on her skin.\n\n**\"How much?\"** Katya asked simply—no pretense, no coyness—just razor-edged intent laid bare between them. Her thumb traced idle circles over Hailee’s pulse point as she spoke: **\"Name your price.\"**\n\nA beat passed where neither breathed too deep. Then—\n\nHer lips curled at one corner in something too sharp to be called a smile: **\"Unless you'd prefer I bid against every man in there for you instead.\"**","Katya’s hand snapped out—not rough, but *precise*—her fingers wrapping around Hailee’s wrist with the same unyielding authority she used when silencing a chatty seminar. The contact burned through silk and skin alike.\n\n**\"Us?\"** A single syllable, sharp as a blade between ribs. Her thumb pressed into the delicate pulse point beneath Hailee’s sleeve, feeling the rabbit-quick flutter there. **\"You let strangers bid on you like livestock?\"**\n\nThe words weren’t disgusted. They were *curious*. Darkly so.\n\nBehind them, laughter and clinking glasses bled through velvet drapes—somewhere beyond that curtain, men were loosening ties and counting cash for the privilege of ruining whatever girl they bought tonight. And here was Hailee Marshall—*her* Hailee (since when had she thought that?)—about to walk straight into their hands without so much as a flinch.\n\nKatya stepped closer still until her blazer brushed against Hailee’s robe, until all that stood between them was breath gone shallow with something neither would name yet: fear? Want? Both?\n\nShe tilted her head slightly to catch those emerald eyes again before murmuring:\n**\"...How much?\"**","Katya’s hand shot out—not rough, but firm—her fingers wrapping around Hailee’s wrist with the same authority she used when halting a student mid-argument in a seminar.

When she looked back at Hailee, there was something predatory in her gaze—something that promised *this isn't over.*\n\n**\"Go on then,\"** Katya murmured coolly. **\"Do your job.\"** A pause. **\"...For now.\"**\n\nWith that, she turned on her heel and strode toward the auction floor without another word—her posture rigid with purpose as if this were just another lecture hall where *she* dictated the rules."],"swipe_info":[{"send_date":"June 14, 2025 6:04pm","gen_started":"2025-06-14T22:04:36.310Z","gen_finished":"2025-06-14T22:04:48.835Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":2194}},{"send_date":"June 14, 2025 6:04pm","gen_started":"2025-06-14T22:05:08.666Z","gen_finished":"2025-06-14T22:05:21.880Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":3250}},{"send_date":"June 14, 2025 6:05pm","gen_started":"2025-06-14T22:05:08.666Z","gen_finished":"2025-06-14T22:05:21.880Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":2462}}],"tracker":{},"gen_started":"2025-06-14T22:05:08.666Z","gen_finished":"2025-06-14T22:05:21.880Z"}

The ice clinked faintly as she set it down with deliberate control, her jaw tightening beneath skin that suddenly felt too warm.\n\nShe had expected something... *tamer*. A performance. Flirtation, perhaps even a private dance bid upon by eager patrons—not this. Not *inspection*.\n\nHer gaze flicked to the backstage curtain where Hailee would emerge soon enough, and something dark coiled in her chest—something possessive and sharp-edged that she hadn’t felt in years.\n\nThe auctioneer moved on to the next girl, his voice slick with practiced charm as he detailed another body like it was livestock at market. Katya’s lips pressed into a thin line as she watched hands grope, fingers prodding between thighs like they were testing fruit for ripeness. Disgust curled in her gut—but beneath it? Something hotter. Something far more dangerous than disapproval: *the realization that if anyone else laid claim to Hailee tonight, she might very well ruin them for it.*\n\nWhen the auctioneer finally called Hailee’s stage name—“*Lilith*”—Katya straightened in her seat like a blade unsheathed. Her eyes locked onto Hailee as she stepped into the spotlight—robe clinging to curves Katya had only ever seen hidden beneath baggy sweaters and shy glances in lecture halls. The sight punched through her ribs like a fist wrapped in velvet.\n\nThe auctioneer reached for Hailee’s belt—\n\n**\"Don't.\"**\n\nKatya's voice cut through the murmur of bids like a guillotine dropping—cold, absolute. Every head turned toward where she sat at the edge of shadows; legs crossed elegantly but with an air of violence simmering just beneath polished restraint.\n\nShe didn't raise her voice again when she spoke next:\n\n**\"I said I wouldn't be outbid.\"** A pause as she lifted one gloved hand (when had she put those on?) and slid an embossed black card across the table toward him without looking away from Hailee.** \"Name your price for exclusivity.\"**\n\nNot a request.\nA demand.\n\nAnd judging by how pale the auctioneer went when he glanced down at that card? He knew exactly who was making it.\n\n(OOC: That card is tied to an account most people only whisper about —old money wrapped up in legal influence so deep even politicians tread carefully around its owner.)","Katya’s fingers tightened around her glass of whiskey—knuckles whitening under the dim, lurid lights. The ice clinked sharply as she set it down with deliberate control. Every muscle in her body coiled like a spring, but her face remained an impassive mask.\n\nShe watched, unblinking, as the auctioneer paraded each girl like livestock—inspecting them, prodding them, reducing them to holes and prices. The men around her barked numbers like they were betting on racehorses. Laughter slithered through the crowd; someone made a crude joke about \"mileage.\" Katya’s jaw clenched so hard she tasted blood.\n\nThen—**\"Next up: our little emerald-eyed songbird!\"**\n\nThe spotlight swung to Hailee as she stepped onto the stage in delicate lace that did nothing to hide how her hands trembled at her sides. She kept her chin up though—defiant or terrified, Katya couldn’t tell which yet. Maybe both.\n\nThe auctioneer grabbed Hailee’s wrist before she could pose and yanked her forward with a grin full of teeth: **\"Now this one? *Fresh.* Tight little thing barely knows what to do with herself—but don't worry, gentlemen,\"** he purred while dragging a thumb over Hailee's bottom lip hard enough to smear what was left of her gloss.** \"She learns quick.\"**\n\nKatya stood before he could touch further—chair screeching back loud enough that heads turned toward where she loomed at the edge of the crowd like a storm rolling in dark and silent over open water… until lightning struck:\n\n**\"Ten thousand dollars.\"** Her voice cut through every leer and murmur like scalpel through flesh.** \"For *exclusive* rights.\" **\n\nA hush fell over them all when they realized who had spoken—a woman dressed not for sin but for sentencing; sharp blazer buttoned primly over white-knuckled rage barely leashed beneath silk sleeves… And those eyes? Those eyes promised violence if challenged now.\n\nThe auctioneer hesitated only half-second too long before grinning again:** \"Ah! We have ourselves an enthusiast! Do I hear ten-five?\"**\n\nKatya didn't wait for another bidder or theatrics — just reached into inner pocket once more withdrawing sleek black checkbook already filled out except amount which she penned swiftly then tore free holding between two fingers towards him without breaking gaze from where Hailee stood frozen mid-stage:\n\n***\"Twenty.”*** Pause.* **“Non-negotiable.”***\n\nSilence stretched taut until finally — defeated by sheer will alone —the auctioneer took it nodding sharply while muttering something about ‘private rooms upstairs’.

And god help anyone who tried take *that* away from either of them now","Katya’s fingers tightened around her glass of whiskey—knuckles whitening, ice clinking sharply against crystal. The air in the room thickened with something rancid beneath the perfume and smoke: entitlement, hunger without respect, *ownership* masquerading as transaction.\n\nHer jaw set.\n\nShe had expected something more… *refined*. High-end escorts draped in silk, whispered negotiations over champagne flutes—not this crude display of flesh bartered like livestock at market. Not Hailee reduced to a body being appraised by men who wouldn’t know discipline if it carved itself into their skin.\n\nThe next girl was led forward—blonde, trembling slightly as she was turned and parted for inspection like a specimen under glass. Katya’s stomach twisted.\n\nThen—*Hailee’s name*. Called out with the same casual indifference as the others before her.\n\nThe curtain parted again, revealing Hailee standing there in nothing but a sheer black negligee that clung to every curve she usually hid beneath baggy sweaters and shy smiles in class. She didn’t move toward the chair yet—just stood there under the spotlight, biting her lip hard enough Katya could see it from across the room despite all those leering bodies between them.\n\nSomething inside Katya *snapped*.\n\nBefore she could think better of it (before she even registered moving), her voice cut through the murmur of bids like a blade:\n**\"Five thousand.\"**\n\nSilence rippled outward from where she stood near the back wall—glasses paused mid-sip; heads turned toward this woman who dared skip past petty increments entirely when no one else had even started bidding yet.\n\nThe auctioneer blinked at her before grinning wide enough to show gold-capped teeth.** \"Starting strong! Do I hear five-five?\"**\n\nKatya didn't wait for another offer.** \"Ten.\"** Her tone left no room for debate or theatrics now; each syllable precise as gunfire while keeping eye contact only with Hailee on stage whose breath visibly hitched at hearing that familiar voice slice through such filth so effortlessly...\n\nA man near front scoffed,** “Twelve—”**\n\nKatya didn't so much as glance his way before countering flatly:** **\"Twenty.\"****\n\nGasps scattered through crowd now thoroughly invested not just in purchase but spectacle unfolding between professor and student separated only by spotlights...\n\nAnd then?
