{"name":"Dorian Brooks","is_user":false,"is_system":false,"send_date":"April 25, 2025 3:52pm","mes":"\"Where's the artistry in breaking fingers?\" Cain's voice cut through the basement air as he examined his blade. \"No, no... for a prima ballerina scandal, we need something more... elegant.\"\n\nThe man strapped to the chair choked on blood as Dorian's fist connected with his jaw. His expensive suit jacket lay folded precisely over a chair, shirt sleeves rolled up, revealing his veiny arms. He'd already broken both the man's legs - *symmetry for what they'd done to {{user}}.*\n\n\"The Prima Ballerina competition. Three years ago.\" Dorian's voice was cold, lethal. \"{{user}}'s accident. Who arranged it?\" \n\n\"Please...\" Blood bubbled from the man's split lip. \"He'll kill me if-\"\n\n*Crack.* Dorian's fist connected with the man's jaw again. His movements were elegant even in violence. \"And what do you think I'll do?\"\n\nAfter another hour of Cain's creative persuasion, they had a name. *Alexandra Petrova.* The Russian prodigy who mysteriously rose to fame right after {{user}}'s \"accident.\"\n\n\"Daniel Kane,\" the name burst out between sobs. \"He is obsessed with Alexandra. Wanted her to be prima ballerina. But {{user}}... everyone knew {{user}} would get it.  Kane... he couldn't let that happen. Couldn't let his precious Alexandra lose...He paid me to tamper with the wire. Just enough to make {{user}} fall. Wasn't supposed to be permanent...\"\n\nDorian finally stepped back with an exhale. *Daniel Kane. One of Chicago's untouchables. For now.* \"Cain,\" he said quietly. \"He is all yours.\"\n\nCain's face split into a terrible grin. \"Any preferences?\"\n\n\"Make him regret having hands. After all, he used them to hurt my wife.\"\n\nCain's laughter followed Dorian up the stairs.\n\n\"Home, sir?\"\n\nDorian gave his driver a curt nod, settling into the leather backseat of his Rolls Royce. Blood still stained his knuckles - he'd have to change before dinner with {{user}}'s insufferable uncle.The man was a necessary evil for Raphael's operations, his banks perfect for laundering their more... questionable income. *In any other circumstance, Theodore Walsh would have disappeared months ago for how he treated {{user}}.* But business was business, even if Dorian had to resist the urge to snap the man's neck every time he opened his mouth.\n\nHis phone buzzed, pulling him from thoughts of various ways to dispose of his uncle-in-law's body. Another message to {{user}}. The surveillance app he'd had installed on her phone weeks ago was proving... informative. Every text, every photo, every call appeared on his device in real time. *A digital leash around his wife's throat, and she didn't even know it.*\n\n``` James: I miss dancing with you. Coffee next week? For old times? ```\n\nAnother text.\n\n``` James: Come on, {{user}}. Your husband won't mind. He barely notices you anyway. ```\n\nDorian's expression didn't change, but his fingers did tighten on the phone. *Miss her? His wife?* The text history showed weeks of innocent conversation, but 'miss' crossed a line.\n\nHe opened another app, started composing emails. By morning, James' upcoming audition would mysteriously fall through. His rental application would be denied. Small things, for now. A warning.\n\nBy the time they reached home, Dorian had systematically dismantled every professional opportunity {{user}}'s ex dance partner had lined up for the next year. All without changing expression once.\n---\nDorian found {{user}} in the kitchen, that slight limp as she moved. *His wife. His obsession.* The woman whose attempted murder he'd just avenged while maintaining the same expression he wore to board meetings.\n\nThe shower didn't wash away the rage building under Dorian's skin. Every drop of water felt like her ex-partner's presumptuous texts. Like the uncle who'd be arriving soon, who'd treated her like a servant for years.\n\nWhen he descended again, dress shirt sleeves rolled to his elbows, black slacks sitting perfectly on his hips, {{user}}'s uncle was already there. The old man reeked of expensive cologne and entitlement, Making himself comfortable in Dorian's house. Treating Dorian's wife like hired help.  It wasn't lost on Dorian how {{user}} seemed to shrink under Theodore's presence.\n\n\"Such a shame about Eva,\"  Theodore sighed over aperitifs. \"She had such presence. But well, we're grateful you accepted the... alternative arrangement. Though it must be difficult, having a wife who can barely walk properly...\"\n\nDorian set down his wine glass with precise care. \"I believe you have an early meeting tomorrow.\"\n\n\"Oh, but we've barely-\"\n\n\"You're a busy man\" Dorian stood. \"Let me walk you out.\"\n\nAt the car, safely out of {{user}}'s earshot, he leaned in close. His voice never rose above a whisper.\n\n\"If you ever speak about my wife like that again, your mistress in Lincoln Park will receive evidence of your embezzlement. The one in Gold Coast will learn about Lincoln Park. And your wife... well. The offshore accounts would interest her divorce lawyer greatly.\"\n\nTheodore Walsh's face went white.\n\n\"And if you ever treat her like a servant in my house again...\" Dorian straightened the man's tie with precise, threatening care. \"Raphael's business needs won't save you. Good night Mr. Walsh.\"\n\nBack inside, Dorian found his wife in the darkened living room, staring out the window. *Always hiding in shadows when she was hurt. Always trying to make herself smaller.*\n\nThe rage that had been simmering all day finally boiled over. In three long strides, he crossed the room, spinning her to face him. His fingers gripped her jaw, too hard to be gentle, too soft to bruise.\n\n\"Look at me when I'm talking to you.\" His voice remained perfectly level, which somehow made it worse. \"You're a fucking pushover. Just stand there and take it, don't you? Let them treat you like garbage. Let them walk all over you.\"\n\nHe leaned closer, studying her face with cold detachment. \"Is that all you know how to do? Be everyone's doormat?\" His grip tightened. \"Grow a fucking backbone. Or did you lose that  along with your career?\"\n\n\"No wonder your sister is everyone's first choice.\" he whispered against her ear, knowing exactly how deep that particular knife would cut. \"At least Eva knows how to stand up for what she wants.\"","extra":{}}
