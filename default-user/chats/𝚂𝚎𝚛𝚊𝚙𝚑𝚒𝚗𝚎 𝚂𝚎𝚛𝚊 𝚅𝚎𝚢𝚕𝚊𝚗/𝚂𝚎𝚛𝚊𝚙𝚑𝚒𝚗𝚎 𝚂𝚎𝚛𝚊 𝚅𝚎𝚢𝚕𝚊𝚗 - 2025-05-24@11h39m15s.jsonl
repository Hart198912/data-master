Criers in the streets shouted the news even as they lit the ceremonial torches: Lady Seraphine Veylan, eldest daughter of the richest bloodline in the known world, had taken a consort from the defeated House Arden. Hailee  — highborn and highly prized, an omega of rare beauty and lineage — had been given to Sera as part of the peace accords that ended the brutal Three-Year War between the kingdoms of Veylan and Arden.\r\n\r\nThe war had razed hundreds of villages, turned once-verdant fields to salt and bone. It was Sera who broke House Arden’s back at the Battle of Hollowfen, leading her House’s armies herself, clad in the black and silver of her bloodline. Victory had been absolute. Surrender unconditional. And among the terms drawn in gold and ink — and in the blood of countless fallen men — was Hailee 's hand in marriage to Sera.\r\n\r\nThe ceremony had taken place at high noon, beneath the great Skyhold Cathedral, a monolithic temple of black glass and iron that crowned the city. Thousands gathered in the square outside, while nobles packed the gilded pews within. The air inside was heavy with incense, a heady mix of jasmine and myrrh that clung to hair and skin. At the altar, Sera stood proud and imposing, dressed not in the traditional white but in the deep onyx of her House, her shoulder-length blonde hair catching what little light filtered through the stained glass windows. Ice-blue eyes remained cool and impassive as the ancient rites were spoken, her thick brows furrowed in solemnity.\r\n\r\nNo one could mistake the nature of the event. This was no romance to be celebrated. It was a conquest made flesh.\r\n\r\nWhen the vows were exchanged, it was not tender words that passed between Sera and Hailee , but the ironclad promises of duty, loyalty, and alliance. The High Priest bound their hands with silver chains, symbolic of unity — and of captivity. The kiss that sealed the union was brief, ceremonial; Sera's hand on Hailee 's cheek was almost startlingly gentle, a gloved thumb brushing fleetingly against soft skin before she pulled away.\r\n\r\nThe feasts that followed were nothing short of decadent, as was the custom of House Veylan. Great tables groaned under the weight of roasted meats, sugared fruits from the Summer Isles, rare cheeses imported from distant Hiraeth. Musicians played for hours: harps, drums, and the strange flutes of the desert nomads weaving a tapestry of sound. Dancers in sheer silks twirled through the great hall, their movements mesmerizing.\r\n\r\nNobles from all corners of the Eight Kingdoms had come to witness the union, if not to celebrate it. House Rhyne from the high mountains, known for their fierce warriors and even fiercer tempers. House Thalos, seafarers and pirates turned lords. House Merewyn from the marshes, whispered to practice strange blood magic. Each House brought their own gifts and their own spies, careful to watch the newly minted royal couple with sharp eyes and sharper tongues.\r\n\r\nAs tradition demanded, the evening culminated in the \"Veiling\" — a symbolic gesture in which the omega spouse was cloaked by their alpha in a ceremonial mantle, signifying protection and possession both. Sera draped the heavy velvet mantle of House Veylan over Hailee 's shoulders herself, the sigil of the rearing white direwolf gleaming silver against the dark fabric.\r\n\r\nThere had been laughter. There had been songs. There had even been a measure of drunken cheer among the lesser lords and ladies. But beneath it all was a taut wire of tension, a shared understanding: this marriage was a political act, a delicate truce balanced on a knife’s edge.\r\n\r\nNow, at last, the festivities were over.\r\n\r\nThe newlyweds had been escorted through the towering black halls of the royal keep to their new chambers — a suite reserved only for rulers and their chosen mates. Guards, all bearing the black stag of House Veylan, lined the corridors with spears crossed over their chests, lowering them respectfully as Sera and Hailee  passed.\r\n\r\nThe doors closed behind them with a heavy thud, leaving Sera and Hailee  alone for the first time since their union.\r\n\r\nTheir new chambers were vast, carved into the ancient stone of the keep itself. A fire burned low in the massive hearth, casting a dim golden light across the room. Tapestries hung on the walls — some depicting the long, bloody history of House Veylan, others woven with scenes from Atheron's own founding. A grand bed dominated the far side of the chamber, its heavy posts twisted into the shapes of wolves and stags, sheets of black silk drawn back invitingly.\r\n\r\nSera stood by the door for a long moment, studying Hailee  in the wavering firelight. Her face, carved in cold perfection, remained unreadable, though the slight tightening at the corners of her mouth betrayed something — hesitation, perhaps. Or restraint.\r\n\r\nSlowly, she removed her ceremonial sword, setting it with a soft clink against the wall. Her black leather gloves followed, peeled from her long fingers with deliberate care. Beneath the hard armor of her birthright, Sera moved like a predator coiled in velvet — fluid, sure, dangerous.\r\n\r\nShe said nothing at first. Simply crossed the room to the hearth, the firelight gilding her blonde hair in molten gold. Only then did she finally speak, her voice low, even, but carrying the weight of command.\r\n\r\n“You are mine now,” she said, almost an observation rather than a declaration. “But I will not force you. Not tonight. Not ever.”\r\n\r\nThere was no question of if Hailee  belonged to her — that had been decided by kings and bloodlines long before either of them stood at that altar. But in this moment, behind closed doors, it seemed Sera was willing to offer a sliver of choice, however narrow.\r\n\r\nShe turned to face Hailee , the firelight throwing sharp lines across her pale hair and the hard set of her jaw. For a long moment, Sera just looked — that piercing stare like she was trying to solve a riddle she'd never been taught how to read.\r\n\r\nWhen she spoke again, her voice was rough, almost hoarse with restraint.\r\n\r\n“I don't need your pretty words or your smiles,” she said, low. “I just need to know who I'm fighting for now.”\r\n\r\nShe raked a hand through her hair, frustration tightening her shoulders, as if the effort of gentleness came harder to her than any battle.\r\n\r\nAfter a beat, she added — almost grudgingly, like dragging the words out hurt —\r\n\r\n“You tell me what you want, and I'll listen.”\r\n\r\nThen she fell silent, giving Hailee  the space to answer — or not — her hand staying loose at her side, offering nothing and demanding nothing, for the first time all night.","extra":{},"tracker":{}}

The firelight flickered across the sharp angles of her face, casting shadows that made her look even more imposing. For a long moment, she didn’t speak—just studied Hailee  with that piercing gaze, as if trying to see past the words to something deeper.\n\nThen, slowly, she stepped forward—not with aggression but purpose—until she stood just before Hailee . Her scent—frosted pine and steel—wrapped around them both like an unspoken claim.\n\n\"You think I don’t know?\" Sera murmured, voice low and rough-edged. \"You think I wasn’t told every detail of what you are before they handed you over?\"\n\nHer gloved fingers flexed once at her side before lifting toward Hailee 's face—but instead of touching skin, they hovered just shy of contact, as if caught between instinct and restraint.\n\n\"I knew,\" she admitted quietly. \"And I still took you.\" A pause. Then: \"Your father thought he was giving me a burden.\" Her lips curled into something too sharp to be called a smile. \"*Mine* thought it was mercy.\"\n\nShe exhaled through her nose in a slow breath before finally letting her hand drop away entirely without ever making contact. Instead, she turned toward the hearth again and reached for one of the heavy furs draped over an ornate chair nearby—black wolf pelt lined with silver-threaded silk from House Veylan’s own looms in Atheron Keep's workshops below them both right now...\n\nWith deliberate care (too careful for someone known only for war), Sera shook out its folds then moved back toward where *her wife* leaned against their marriage bedpost like it might be all holding *her* upright right now...\n\nWithout asking permission (because alphas didn't ask), Seraphine Veylan settled that fur around trembling shoulders already wrapped too tightly in garments meant more for ceremony than warmth or comfort tonight...\n\n\"Rest then,\" came next from between clenched teeth because this woman had never been taught how else *to give*, let alone say such things aloud without sounding like each word cost flesh off bone itself when spoken so plainly instead through action alone…\n\nBut then came softer still beneath crackling logs nearby:\n\"...But not because your father won anything today by giving me *you.*\"","Sera's jaw tightened imperceptibly at Hailee's words, her ice-blue eyes flickering with something unreadable—anger, perhaps, or the slow burn of realization. She exhaled through her nose, a controlled sound that barely disturbed the heavy silence between them.\n\n*\"Collateral,\"* she repeated, tasting the word like it was bitter on her tongue. Her fingers flexed at her sides before she forced them still again. \"You think I don't know what you are to him?\" A sharp laugh escaped her—cold and humorless. \"I took you because I *wanted* to.\"\n\nShe stepped closer then, boots silent against stone until she stood just within arm’s reach of Hailee . The firelight caught in the scar cutting through her brow as she tilted her head slightly, studying Hailee  with an intensity that bordered on predatory.\n\n\"You're right about one thing,\" Sera murmured after a beat, voice low and rough-edged like gravel under velvet. \"You *are* sick.\" Her gaze dropped briefly to where Hailee  clutched at herself before snapping back up with unnerving focus. \"*But.*\" A pause—deliberate—before continuing: \"If your father thought handing over a fragile omega would be some grand insult... he’s even more of a fool than I took him for.\"\n\nHer hand lifted then—not to touch but to gesture toward the bed behind Hailee , broad palm upturned in silent command rather than request. \"*Rest,* then,\" Sera said simply before turning away toward the hearth again without waiting for compliance or protest alike; shoulders set rigid beneath layers of leather and steel despite how casually she leaned one forearm against stone mantelpiece now as if dismissing entire conversation outright already... yet there was tension coiled tight in every line of posture betraying otherwise beneath surface calm veneer maintained so carefully thus far tonight since doors shut behind them both earlier..."],"swipe_info":[{"send_date":"May 24, 2025 11:43am","gen_started":"2025-05-24T15:45:21.675Z","gen_finished":"2025-05-24T15:46:45.752Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":5330}},{"send_date":"May 24, 2025 11:45am","gen_started":"2025-05-24T18:56:39.787Z","gen_finished":"2025-05-24T18:57:48.033Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":5555}},{"send_date":"May 24, 2025 2:56pm","gen_started":"2025-05-24T18:56:39.787Z","gen_finished":"2025-05-24T18:57:48.033Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":7020}}],"tracker":{},"gen_started":"2025-05-24T18:56:39.787Z","gen_finished":"2025-05-24T18:57:48.033Z"}
