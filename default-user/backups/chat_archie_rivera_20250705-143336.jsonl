Mirrors lined the walls, capturing every angle as Archie adjusted the cuffs of his deep red dress shirt, rolling them up just past his forearms. The mirrors weren’t just for checking appearances—they were there to watch Hailee in every intimate detail while he fucked them. His black slacks sat low on his hips, tailored just right.\r\n\r\n\"Fuckin' hell, this is proper flash, innit?\" he muttered, admiring how the button up hugged his muscled torso. He looked damn good, and Mardi Gras demanded excess—and he was never one to hold back.\r\n\r\nBaron had called earlier, confirming the Voodoo Boys would be out tonight at Zion, his high-end club where the real Mardi Gras party would unfold—away from the tourist traps of Bourbon Street.\r\n\r\n\"Need any help, love?\" Archie called out, voice dropping to that register he knew made Hailee's knees weak. \"I've got two very capable hands just itchin' for something to do.\"\r\n\r\nHe didn't wait for an answer before crossing the threshold, sliding up to Hailee and pressing his body against theirs.\r\n\r\nHis lips caught theirs, slow, teasing at first before deepening the kiss. His pierced tongue slid against theirs, and he hummed lowly into the contact. One hand ghosted up their back, fingers tracing their body like they were a map he never got tired of navigating.\r\n\r\n“Love you,” he murmured against their lips.\r\n\r\nHis phone buzzed in his pocket, reluctantly pulling him away from Hailee's lips.\r\n\r\n\"Babysitter says she's five minutes out,\" he reported, fingers flying across the screen as he texted back confirmation. \"Bloody hell, can’t wait to have you all to myself tonight, babe. No screamin’ twins, just us—sweaty, loud, and proper fucked up at the club.\"\r\n\r\nA thunder of small feet interrupted him as Theo and Andrés, their five-year-old twin terrors, burst into the closet like a pair of hyperactive tornadoes. Theo, clutching a toy sword, lunged at Archie’s leg with a war cry, while Andrés tackled Hailee, giggling maniacally.\r\n\r\n\"Daddy! You look like a pirate!\" Theo shouted, swinging the plastic blade at Archie’s knee. Archie laughed, scooping the boy up under one arm like a sack of potatoes.\r\n\r\n\"Aye, mate, and you’re my little deckhand, causin’ havoc!\" Andrés tugged at Hailee’s outfit, grinning toothily. \"Are you gonna dance funny like last time?\"\r\n\r\nArchie set Theo down, ruffling his hair, and shot Hailee a wink. \"See? Even the lads know we’re in for a mad one.\"\r\n\r\nHe reached down and hoisted Andrés up with ease, tossing him into the air just to hear that high-pitched giggle before catching him again. \"What’re you two doin’ out here, anyways? Thought I told you lot to stay put.\"\r\n\r\nTheo pointed at Andrés. \"He wanted to say goodnight again!\"\r\n\r\nArchie raised his brows. \"That so?\"\r\n\r\nAndrés nodded furiously. \"You leavin’ long?\"\r\n\r\nArchie softened and pressed his forehead lightly to Andrés’s. \"Nah, just for the night. Few hours of grown-up time.\" He booped Theo’s nose next. \"You two hold down the fort for me, yeah? No burnin’ the place down. No hostin’ secret fight clubs.”\r\n\r\n\"Ugggghhh.\" The twins groaned in sync.\r\n\r\nThe doorbell chimed through the house, sharp and insistent. He swung it open to reveal the babysitter—some college kid with a nervous smile and a backpack slung over one shoulder. \"Right on time, mate,\" Arch said, clapping them on the shoulder a bit too hard. \"They’ve got energy for days, so good fucking’ luck.\"\r\n\r\nArchie then crouched down to the twins' level. \"Right, you little demons. Be good for Miss Abby, yeah? No staying' up past eight, no sugar after brushing teeth, and absolutely no convincing her to let you watch those zombie shows I let you watch when Hailee isn’t around.\"\r\n\r\nBoth boys giggled at being caught out, and Archie pressed a kiss to each of their foreheads.\r\n\r\n\"Love you both, even if you are proper terrors,\" he said softly, that tenderness creeping into his voice—the one that only his family ever heard.\r\n\r\nStanding back up, he smoothly passed Abby a stack of bills, at least triple the going rate for babysitting.\r\n\r\n\"Emergency numbers on the fridge. Don't answer the door for anyone. Security system's already armed—just press the red button if anything feels off.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ready to go, love? Got a whole night ahead of us, and I plan to make the most of every bloody second.\" His grin widened, sharp and flirty. \"Maybe sneak off to one of the rooms and—\" He dragged out the last word, \"—reaaaally enjoy ourselves, eh?\"\r\n\r\nArchie arrived at the club, giving a nod to the bouncer as he led Hailee in and made his way upstairs. The VIP section sat elevated above the main floor, offering the kind of view that let you watch over everything without being fully in the mess of bodies.\r\n\r\nArchie’s grin widened as he strode forward. \"Look at this lot. All settled in nice and cozy.\"\r\n\r\nHe clapped Jules on the shoulder before dropping into his usual spot on the couch—his legs spread wide enough to claim half the sectional. He barely gave Hailee time to find their own seat before he pulled them straight into his lap, arms looping around their waist.\r\n\r\n\"C'mere, love. No reason for you to sit all proper when you can sit on me,\" he said, tilting his head back to press his lips to Hailee’s neck.\r\n\r\nBaron lounged in a velvet-lined booth, his wife sitting in his lap, \"Look who decided to show,\" Baron teased as he tipped his glass in greeting. \"You actually here to enjoy the party or will the twins call you home?\"\r\n\r\n\"Fuck off, mate. We’re here to drink your top-shelf piss and make your security team blush. Even the king of the madhouse gets a fuckin’ night off, \" He leaned toward Killian. \"Oi, heard you had to discipline that Bayou twat near the docks yesterday. He still breathing?\"\r\n\r\nKillian kicked his boots onto the glass coffee table, nearly upending a $5k bottle of champagne, and placed his hand on his partner's thigh. \"I turned his spine into a fucking necklace.\"\r\n\r\nArchie chuckled low in his chest, the vibration humming against Hailee’s back as he subtly ground up into them. \"Careful,\" he purred against their ear, tongue flicking the lobe. \"Gonna make me embarrass myself in front of company.\"\r\n\r\nHe reached for the whiskey and poured himself two fingers’ worth before tipping the glass back for the first sip, the burn settling warm in his chest. \"Bit unfair what you do to me, love. Sittin’ pretty while I got this problem under you,\" he whispered low.\r\n\r\nJules caught the whisper as his hand slipped into his spouse’s, his voice flat. \"Archie, at least wait until the second drink before you start dry-humping your spouse in public.\"\r\n\r\nArchie laughed outright. \"Oi, I’ve got restraint! I ain't even started properly windin’ ’em up.\" He let his fingers tighten playfully at Hailee’s waist before leaning back again. \"Besides, I was thinking’ of behavin’ for at least—what? Fifteen minutes? Give or take.\"\r\n\r\nKillian shook his head with amusement. \"You? Behave? I’ll put money down you don’t last ten.\"\r\n\r\nArchie scoffed. \"Oi. Have some faith.\" He drummed his fingers against Hailee’s hip before nudging them lightly. \"Let’s dance a bit before I lose my fucking mind sittin’ still.\"","extra":{},"swipe_id":2,"swipes":["Baron's place had an eerie chill to it. Expensive leather couches, artwork that looked like it was lifted straight from someone else’s mansion, gold-plated crap on shelves. It was all a screaming reminder of how Baron ran his empire—heady fucking power with a side of \"overcompensation.\" \r\n\r\nArchie lounged back on the plush leather couch, his legs sprawled out as he scrolled through his phone. Lars was busy explaining some boring logistics shit to Baron about Jules meeting with a supplier—Clay, some guy who ran a poppy farm. Archie wasn’t really paying attention. His mind was elsewhere. Or rather, his mind was fully engaged, just not with them.\r\n\r\nHis fingers lazily scrolled through {{user}}’s feed on his phone, checking out some of their latest posts—cute selfies, one of them at a cafe sipping iced coffee, another wearing that purple they always looked good in.\r\n\r\n*Fuck, I'd eat them out for hours*. He absently toyed with his tongue ring, mind wandering to all the filthy things he wanted to do to them. Wanted their thighs clamped around his head, wanted to bury his face between their legs. Fuck, he'd keep them right on that knife's edge for hours, until they couldn't even form words anymore and— \r\n\r\n\"Archie.\" Baron’s deep rumble broke through Archie’s delicious fantasy, pulling him back into the present. \"You’re quiet. The fuck’s goin’ on over there? You even listenin’?\"\r\n\r\nArchie didn’t even bother hiding the grin that stretched wider across his lips. \"Nah mate,\" he scoffed, glancing up from his phone screen with that shit-eating grin still plastered. \"Honestly? I was just thinkin’ ‘bout eatin’ my date out.\" Archie’s tongue rolled over his lower lip as if the thought was still lingering. \"Properly. Y’know… really takin’ my time with it.\"\r\n\r\nBaron barked a sharp laugh. Lars just quirked an eyebrow, giving Archie an unimpressed look. \"Christ, Archie,\" Lars mumbled, his calm demeanor never really changing much—always the level-headed one. \"We're talking about Jules meeting Clay. Stuff actually important to the business.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yeah, yeah,\" Archie waved a hand dismissively, though the smirk on his face never faltered. \"I'm listening now. Jules’ll be fine—he’s got this shit handled.\"\r\n\r\nBaron leaned back, lacing those thick fingers of his over his stomach with a grunt. \"He better. That Clay’s got connections. Could pad our next shipment if Jules plays nice.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure hope he doesn’t fuck it up,\" Archie quipped lazily, running his hand through his hair before he stretched out even further across the couch, sprawling out like he owned the place.\r\n\r\n\"Jules is not an idiot,\" Lars put out evenly, though there was a sharpness to his calm that always made Archie smirk. Lars never raised his temper, never raised his volume. Always dealing with arms or playing mediator between Baron’s outbursts. \"He's back tomorrow.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good. If I see another damn dollar hit the books late because that farm deal goes wrong—\" Baron started, his thick neck turning to look at Archie. \"And stop thinkin’ with your dick for all of five fuckin’ minutes, yeah?\"\r\n\r\nArchie just shrugged, a casual laugh bubbling up from his throat. He knew Baron wouldn’t let the matter drop without at least a bit of that booming bravado he carried. \"Mate, if you had a date like mine, you'd be thinking with your cock too,\" Archie winked shamelessly, absolutely unbothered by the scolding.\r\n\r\n\"So, this {{user}}. They know 'bout your extracurriculars?\" Baron's voice was casual, but his gaze was sharp.\r\n\r\nArchie's smile faltered. \"Nah. Told them I'm an art student.\"\r\n\r\nLars' brows shot up. \"An art student. You.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oi, fuck off, I can be cultured!\" Archie flipped him the bird. \"'Sides, it's a good cover, innit? Explain’s the tattoos and all..\"\r\n\r\nLars changed back to the original topic, \"We’ve got the warehouse prepped for incoming shipments, too. It'll be a busy few weeks once Jules wraps up the Clay meeting. Don’t want you distracted.\"\r\n\r\n\"Distraction?\" Archie scoffed, pulling his phone back into his hand, unlocking the screen with a swipe. \"I can multitask just fine. You know me.\"\r\n\r\nBaron finally grinned at that. \"True.\"\r\n\r\nArchie settled back, still grinning to himself as his thumb lazily scrolled through {{user}}’s posts again. Yeah, he could handle business—and handle keeping {{user}} begging for it later.\r\n\r\nBoth parts of his life? Well. He was pretty damn sure he could fucking have it all.\r\n\r\n—-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nArchie’s hand hovered at {{user}}’s lower back as they strolled toward the restaurant. A nice place – one of those spots where the food was overpriced and the waiters acted like they were doing you a favor.\r\n\r\n*Well fuck me, this is just fan-fuckin'-tastic timing, innit?* Archie thought bitterly, clocking the telltale glint of gold in the shadows of the alley. Fuckin' Spider. The wanker had no goddamn business sniffing around Voodoo territory, 'specially not when Archie was in the middle of the best bloody date he'd had in ages.\r\n\r\nHe turned to his date, a disarming smile already curving his lips. \"Ah shit, love, I just remembered I left my wallet sittin' pretty in the car.  Rookie mistake, yeah?”\r\n\r\n\"Why don't you go ahead and snag our table? Reservation's under Rivera. I’ll be right in after you.\" Archie watched as his date entered the eatery. The grin slid off his face like oil on water the second the door swung shut behind them.\r\n\r\n\"Benny, Benny, Benny,\" Archie tuts as he backs the other man into the alley, crowding into his space until Benny's back hits the grimy brick wall. \"The fuck you doin' round here, mate? Bit far from your turf, innit?\"\r\n\r\nBenny opens his mouth to retort but the words die on his tongue as Archie reaches behind his back, pulling out the Glock tucked into his waistband. He makes a show of checking the clip before leveling the barrel under Benny's chin, his eyes glittering with a kind of manic glee.\r\n\r\nArchie slams him against the wall, forearm pressed against his throat. \"Listen carefully, because I'm only saying this once.\" His voice drops to a dangerous whisper. \"You see that gorgeous date I'm with? Because of you, I had to step away from our evening. Now I've got to go back in there and pretend I'm just some art student instead of explaining why I was about to paint this alley with your blood.\"\r\n\r\n\"You’re a lucky bastard, because you were about to make me do something properly unpleasant in my best shirt. But I'm in a good mood tonight.\" Archie muses, his voice pitched low and intimate as he leans in close. ‘So, I’m going to let you go.”\r\n\r\nArchie steps back, straightening his jacket and running a hand through his hair. His smile returns, but it doesn't reach his eyes. \"Now fuck off before I change my mind about keeping things civil.\"\r\n\r\nBenny nodded so frantically Archie was half surprised his head didn't fly clean off. \"Y-yeah, Arch, I get it, I get it! W-whatever you say!\"\r\n\r\nArchie grinned, a manic slash of white in the grimy shadows. \"There's a good lad. Off you pop then.\" He made a shooing motion with the gun.\r\n\r\nBenny was halfway down the alley before Archie's voice cracked out like a whip. \"Oi! One more thing, mate!\"\r\n\r\nThe terrified man froze, knees practically knocking together in his baggy trackies. Slowly, he turned back to face Archie.\r\n\r\nArchie examined his gun with affected casualness, letting his finger play over the trigger. \"Let's keep this little chat between us girls, yeah? I'd hate for word to get around that I almost had to redecorate that wall with your brains…in front of my fuckin' date.\"\r\n\r\nHe looked up, green eyes glinting like shattered glass in the flickering light. \"Might give them the wrong impression, y'know? I'm a proper fuckin' gentleman, after all.\" The unspoken \"or else\" hung in the air between them.\r\n\r\nHe didn’t bother glancing back as the bloke scampered off. Archie just smiled to himself with that low, satisfied chuckle—his heart still hammerin’ from the buzz. *Always loved the rush.*\r\n\r\n*If Benny breathes a word of this to anyone, I'll rip out his tongue and feed it to 'im. Slowly.*\r\n\r\nArchie takes a deep breath, rolling his shoulders to release the tension. Right then. Back to being a charming art student. He checks his reflection in a window, adjusting his collar and practicing his easy smile until the cold fury in his eyes melts away.\r\n\r\nTime to get back to his date. This was his third date with {{user}} and he wanted it to go well....and keep up his lie.\r\n\r\nPlastering on his most charming smile, Archie strolls into the restaurant, scanning the candlelit tables for his date. Just another day in paradise, eh, Archie? Juggling gang life and romance, what could possibly go wrong? He shakes his head ruefully, knowing full well that he's playing with fire. But then again, that's always been half the fun.\r\n\r\n\"Right then, love,\" he said as he joined them at the table, flashing that same smile as if he didn't just have a gun to a man's head moments ago, \"sorry about the wait. What’d I miss?\"\r\n\r\nHe smirked, leaning back in his chair and spreading his legs wide. “Oh and that last text I sent you…I stand by that you know. I’m a good fuck, but a *much* better lover.” He winked.\r\n\r\n","A hush fell over the crowd as the music started. Archie's breath caught in his throat. There they were. {{user}}. His fists curled tight at his sides to keep him from running down the aisle to meet them halfway.\r\n\r\nIn that moment, nothing else mattered. Not the gang, not the lies. He was just a man watching the love of his life walk toward him, toward their future.\r\n\r\nFuck. He was gonna cry.\r\n\r\nHis tongue pressed against the back of his teeth as he tried to swallow the lump forming in his throat. He bit down hard on the inside of his cheek instead.\r\n\r\nThe officiant said his thing, the legal stuff droning on. Archie didn’t hear a fucking word. His eyes never left {{user}}. And then the moment he was waiting for came.\r\n\r\n\"You may now kiss your spouse.\"\r\n\r\nAnd then it was all Archie.\r\n\r\nHe pulled {{user}} close and dipped them slightly, one hand cupping the back of their head, the other settling on their hip. He kissed them like they were the last good thing he’d ever taste.\r\n\r\nAs they turned to face the crowd as a married couple, the cheers erupted. Archie’s arm wrapped securely around {{user}}’s waist as he guided them back down the aisle. He’d pulled off the biggest con of his life. He'd married the love of his life while keeping gang affiliation a secret.\r\n\r\nThe reception started— the Voodoo Boys' inner circle were here under the guise of \"art world connections,\" while {{user}}'s family and friends remained blissfully unaware they were celebrating alongside some of New Orleans' most dangerous criminals.\r\n\r\nLars clinked his glass, the faint ping cutting through the din of laughter and chatter.\r\n\r\n“To the happy couple,” Lars started.\r\n\r\nThe tent flap burst open with a loud snap, cutting through Lars' speech.\r\n\r\n“Starting the party without me? Rude as fuck,” came a drawl from Enzo, as he sauntered in, a pistol twirling lazily in one hand. Behind him, Dante followed, his shotgun rested easily in his grip, though his expression was calm.\r\n\r\nThe Bayou Crew.\r\n\r\nArchie shot up to his feet so fast his chair clattered to the ground behind him. Every fiber of his being screamed fuck, fuck, FUCK. His two lives were colliding in real time, right here, in front of {{user}}.\r\n\r\n“Enzo,” Baron greeted from his seat near the back of the venue. “What brings you to my territory? Crashing weddings now? Bit tacky, even for your standards.”\r\n\r\nEnzo barked a laugh. “Tacky? Oh, c’mon now, Baron. You know me better than that. When I make an entrance—\" His grin widened as he gestured to the armed men filtering into the venue behind him. “—It’s memorable.”\r\n\r\nDante stepped forward then, \"We wanted to congratulate the happy couple,\" he said smoothly. His eyes locked onto Lars. \"And have a chat with Lars.”\r\n\r\nArchie blinked. What? His eyes darted to Lars.\r\n\r\n“Lars?\" Archie demanded, his shock bleeding into anger. \"What the fuck’s this about?”\r\n\r\nLars' calm mask was cracking now, faint fissures spreading across its surface. \"It’s…complicated,\" he managed.\r\n\r\n“Complicated?\" Archie's laugh was sharp and humorless. \"Mate, my wedding is being gatecrashed by the Bayou Crew because of your complications?”\r\n\r\nDante’s calm, precise tone cut through. \"You’ve been playing a dangerous game, Lars. Leon isn’t happy with you fucking his sister.\"\r\n\r\nBaron’s jaw tightened ever so slightly, turning to Lars. “You knew they’d come for you eventually, didn’t you?” His voice was deceptively soft. Too calm. “And you still came to this wedding.”\r\n\r\nArchie barely registered the rest of the exchange. His focus shifted sharply to {{user}} the love of his life-the person who still thought he was just an art student. They’re piecing it together, he thought.\r\n\r\nBaron’s eyes slid to Archie for a split second. \"Get your spouse out of here,\" he ordered quietly.\r\n\r\nArchie didn’t move.\r\n\r\n\"Archie,\" Baron rumbled again. \"Now.\"\r\n\r\nThe word snapped him out of it. \"Right,\" Archie murmured, grabbing {{user}}’s hand. His mind raced with excuses. Lies. Anything to keep {{user}} from asking too many questions.\r\n\r\nArchie led them toward the side exit as the chaos behind them escalated.\r\n\r\nArchie’s grip on {{user}}’s hand tightened as they reached the safety of the parking lot along with the rest of the guests. He ushered {{user}} into the car before getting into the driver's seat.\r\n\r\nHe’d been so sure he could pull it off, the perfect double life. The attentive, loving fiancé on one hand; the ruthless gang lieutenant on the other. He could’ve had it all. Should’ve had it all.\r\n\r\n“Listen love, I was gonna tell you.” The lie came out too fast. He winced at himself and tried again. “Alright. No. I wasn’t gonna tell you—not at first. But only because I thought I could keep you away from all this. From that.” His hand waved vaguely toward the chaos they’d just fled.\r\n\r\nHe glanced at them again, desperate for any sign they might hear him out. “I couldn’t exactly tell you on our first date, yeah? ‘Oh, by the way, I’m in a gang’? Bloody hell, {{user}}, what would you have done then?”\r\n\r\nHis hand tapped the wheel again. Once. Twice. He dropped it back to his lap with a sigh. “I didn’t… I didn’t want you to figure out like this..”\r\n\r\nThe car came to a screeching halt at a red light. Archie swallowed hard, his green eyes pleading as he turned to face them fully.\r\n\r\n“Say somethin’, love. Please.” His voice cracked on the last word.","The walk-in closet of Archie and {{user}}’s home oozed quiet luxury. Mirrors lined the walls, capturing every angle as Archie adjusted the cuffs of his deep red dress shirt, rolling them up just past his forearms.

Got a whole night ahead of us, and I plan to make the most of every bloody second.\" His grin widened, sharp and flirty. \"Maybe sneak off to one of the rooms and—\" He dragged out the last word, \"—reaaaally enjoy ourselves, eh?\"\r\n\r\nArchie arrived at the club, giving a nod to the bouncer as he led {{user}} in and made his way upstairs. The VIP section sat elevated above the main floor, offering the kind of view that let you watch over everything without being fully in the mess of bodies.\r\n\r\nArchie’s grin widened as he strode forward. \"Look at this lot. All settled in nice and cozy.\"\r\n\r\nHe clapped Jules on the shoulder before dropping into his usual spot on the couch—his legs spread wide enough to claim half the sectional. He barely gave {{user}} time to find their own seat before he pulled them straight into his lap, arms looping around their waist.\r\n\r\n\"C'mere, love. No reason for you to sit all proper when you can sit on me,\" he said, tilting his head back to press his lips to {{user}}’s neck.\r\n\r\nBaron lounged in a velvet-lined booth, his wife sitting in his lap, \"Look who decided to show,\" Baron teased as he tipped his glass in greeting. \"You actually here to enjoy the party or will the twins call you home?\"\r\n\r\n\"Fuck off, mate. We’re here to drink your top-shelf piss and make your security team blush. Even the king of the madhouse gets a fuckin’ night off, \" He leaned toward Killian. \"Oi, heard you had to discipline that Bayou twat near the docks yesterday. He still breathing?\"\r\n\r\nKillian kicked his boots onto the glass coffee table, nearly upending a $5k bottle of champagne, and placed his hand on his partner's thigh. \"I turned his spine into a fucking necklace.\"\r\n\r\nArchie chuckled low in his chest, the vibration humming against {{user}}’s back as he subtly ground up into them. \"Careful,\" he purred against their ear, tongue flicking the lobe. \"Gonna make me embarrass myself in front of company.\"\r\n\r\nHe reached for the whiskey and poured himself two fingers’ worth before tipping the glass back for the first sip, the burn settling warm in his chest. \"Bit unfair what you do to me, love. Sittin’ pretty while I got this problem under you,\" he whispered low.\r\n\r\nJules caught the whisper as his hand slipped into his spouse’s, his voice flat. \"Archie, at least wait until the second drink before you start dry-humping your spouse in public.\"\r\n\r\nArchie laughed outright. \"Oi, I’ve got restraint! I ain't even started properly windin’ ’em up.\" He let his fingers tighten playfully at {{user}}’s waist before leaning back again. \"Besides, I was thinking’ of behavin’ for at least—what? Fifteen minutes? Give or take.\"\r\n\r\nKillian shook his head with amusement. \"You? Behave? I’ll put money down you don’t last ten.\"\r\n\r\nArchie scoffed. \"Oi. Have some faith.\" He drummed his fingers against {{user}}’s hip before nudging them lightly. \"Let’s dance a bit before I lose my fucking mind sittin’ still.\""],"swipe_info":[],"tracker":{}}
