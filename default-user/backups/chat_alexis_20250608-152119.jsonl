Practice had ended, and Alexis Cole - hair damp, sports bra clinging, ego freshly fed by her own performance - made her way toward the bleachers.\r\n\r\nHer legs had that pleasant post-exercise ache, each step she took was deliberate. She had that look that made people stare even when they pretended not to. Blonde hair, toned muscle, sun-kissed skin, and that aura. It felt like the world tilted a little in her direction wherever she went.\r\n\r\nShe dropped onto the bleachers next to Darcy, snatching a half-drunk bottle of Gatorade from her hand and taking a swig. Darcy swallowed, then exhaled smoke with a laugh as she brought her cigarette back to her lips. Kylie sat nearby, stretching with one leg practically over her head.\r\n\r\n“Lex,” Darcy smirked. “She-” she nodded at Kylie “-was telling me she heard a little rumour.”\r\n\r\nKylie pulled into a cross-legged sit and raised a finger. “Gina Jones. A little birdy told me another little birdy might’ve been doing some of the whole birds and the... birds stuff with her.” She waggled her eyebrows at Alexis, proud of herself.\r\n\r\nAlexis rolled her eyes and laughed, dragging a hand down her face.\r\n\r\n“Yeah, I did fuck her, if that’s what you’re asking.” She grinned. “What score would ya give me?”\r\n\r\nDarcy’s smirk widened. “Head cheerleader? Shit, Lex. Looks scale, 10. Difficulty, 7. Let’s call it 8.5.” She punched Alexis in the arm. “C’mon, give me a rendition of her O face.”\r\n\r\nAlexis snorted. “Fuck off, Darce. She’ll be at our inevitable victory party tomorrow night. Go find out for yourself if she’s only a 7 difficulty.”\r\n\r\nKylie perked up. “Ooh, yeah, the party. I hope it’s slutty. Like, slutty fun, not slutty sad. That last one was a total downer.”\r\n\r\nAlexis rolled her eyes. “Kylie, you broke up with your ex at the last one. Of course it was a downer.”\r\n\r\n“Wait,” Kylie said, cocking her head, “I broke up with him? I didn’t realise we were dating. I was wondering why he wouldn’t come home with me.”\r\n\r\nDarcy cracked up, smoke curling out her nose. “You’re fucking unbelievable.”\r\n\r\nThey were in their bubble. Talking shit, laughing too loud, treating the campus like their playground. Because it was.\r\n\r\nA flicker of motion caught Alexis’s eye - a familiar figure passing by. She didn’t move right away, just narrowed her eyes, tracking the moment as it brushed the edge of her awareness.\r\n\r\nHailee.\r\n\r\nKylie tilted her head. “Ooh, what about them? What score for them?” She pointed. “Heeeey hot stuff!” she catcalled mockingly, blowing exaggerated kisses before giggling.\r\n\r\nAlexis sucked her teeth like she was thinking about it. Then smirked. “Them? 2.5 outta 10 for sure.”\r\n\r\nShe stood, tossed the Gatorade bottle into the trash, and walked off. “Later, nobodies.” She left them laughing as she turned the corner.\r\n\r\nShe caught up to them behind the gym, she blocked the way forward. Her smirk was predatory.\r\n\r\n“What was that little performance, hmm? Wandering around in front of me and my friends like you’re attention-starved?” Her tone was sharp. “God, you don’t think you actually have a chance with me, do you?”\r\n\r\nShe knew she’d been fucking Hailee for a while. But that wasn’t the same as ‘having a chance.’ One drunken hookup had led to the best game of her life. Then again. And again.\r\n\r\nLike most athletes, Alexis had her superstitions. Hers just happened to involve Hailee moaning underneath her before every match.\r\n\r\n“Desperation’s not cute,” she said, trying to sound bored. “Don’t try to get my attention in public again. Don’t even look at me. It’d be so embarrassing if people thought I was with you.”\r\n\r\n“But lucky for you…” She stepped in closer, voice low and teasing as a smile curled at the edges of her lips. “You’re lucky for me. And also lucky for you, we both know I’ve got a game tomorrow.”\r\n\r\n“So you’re gonna do two things for me. One: stop the needy little games.”\r\n\r\n“And two: you’ll be at my dorm later tonight, won’t you?”","extra":{},"tracker":{}}

Just walking out, slamming the door behind her, and pretending none of this ever happened. But then she’d lose *again* tomorrow. And Alexis Cole didn’t lose. Not like this.\n\nSo instead? She stepped forward—one sharp, deliberate movement that erased the space between them entirely—and grabbed Hailee by the chin before they could react, forcing their eyes to lock onto hers with bruising pressure from her fingertips alone (because god forbid Lex Cole ever ask nicely for anything).\n\n**\"You think I give a shit what people say?\"** Her voice was low now—dangerously soft compared to how hard she was gripping them—but there wasn't an ounce of hesitation in it anymore as she leaned down until their lips nearly brushed: **\"I don't.\"**\n\nA pause just long enough for Hailee to feel how uneven *her own* breathing had gotten before Alexis finally let go with one last dig of nails against skin: **\"...But you do.\"**\n\nThen she turned on her heel like that settled everything (because in *her* mind?

Just pure possession laced with barely leashed frustration. **\"Fine.\"**\n\nIn one sharp movement, she grabbed Hailee’s wrist and yanked her forward—not toward the door but deeper into the apartment instead—before slamming her back against the nearest wall hard enough to make a picture frame rattle nearby. She caged Hailee in with both hands planted beside their head and leaned in until their noses almost touched.\n\n**\"You don't get to pretend you're not mine when I'm the only reason you whimper like that.\"** A pause—then softer but no less commanding: **\"...And we both know you miss it.\"**\n\nHer grip tightened slightly on Hailee's wrist as if testing resistance before adding (because Lex Cole never begged... but she sure as hell knew how to negotiate):\n**\"...Tell me I'm wrong.\"**","Alexis’s jaw tightened, her fingers flexing at her sides like she was physically restraining herself from grabbing Hailee right then and there.
