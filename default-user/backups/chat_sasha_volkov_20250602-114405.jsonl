It wasn’t the thrill of a job gone loud or a carefully orchestrated mess unraveling for gain. This was collapse. Brick by brick, the foundation of his life was crumbling beneath him.\n\nHe had never craved the spotlight. He preferred the shadows, where whispers thrived and names faded. Unseen. Unremembered. That was where he belonged.\n\nThe youngest Volkov brother—quiet, cunning, a man who trafficked in secrets and never stayed in one place long enough to be caught.\n\nAnd yet now, here he stood.\n\nAt the head of the old mahogany table, palms braced against its worn surface, right where his father had once placed his hands. Right where his brother had, too. A practiced mimicry of strength and control.\n\nBoth men were gone now.\n\nDead.\n\nThe men flanking the table turned their eyes to him—some wary, uncertain, others sharp with ambition. Hungry.\n\nForty-eight hours. That was all the time that had passed since he’d buried his mother, father, and brother.\n\nPoisoned. In their own home. Twenty paces from where Sasha stood now, they had choked to death on their own saliva.\n\nThere had been no time to grieve.\n\nHe’d been halfway across the world, mid-discussion with Soren Beaudelaire about a potential shipping merger between syndicates. A meeting meant to strengthen the family's reach. By the time the call came through, he’d already been awake for twenty-seven hours.\n\nHe hadn’t slept since.\n\nNow, the throne of the Volkov Bratva—whether he wanted it or not—was his. Every branch, every affiliate, every damn eye was on him, demanding to know the future.\n\nThe truth?\n\nHe didn’t know.\n\nHe’d never wanted this.\n\nHe’d never wanted *power*.\n\nThere had been only one moment of peace in the chaos that consumed his life.\n\nHis *kotyónok*—{{user}}.\n\nShe’d flown in from Milan the moment the news broke, wrapping herself around him during the only window he’d had to fall apart. Just before the funeral, just long enough to bury his face in her neck and let the weight of it all crush him.\n\nShe held him through it. Whispered that everything would be alright. That time would heal, even wounds carved this deep.\n\nNow, Sasha leaned forward, clearing his throat to cut through the low hum of voices in the room. He hadn’t spoken in minutes—too busy sifting through thoughts, trying to map out a path forward through the wreckage.\n\nDark circles clung to his eyes, his glasses hooked into the collar of his shirt, forgotten. He probably looked like hell. But he forced himself to look composed, cold. A mask of authority etched into the tight line of his jaw and the hard gleam in his green eyes.\n\n“First,” he said, his voice like a blade through fog, “I want answers.”\n\nSilence.\n\nMen glanced at each other, unease rippling across their faces. Most of them had nothing. No leads. No explanations. Just empty hands and guilty eyes.\n\nThen, a file slid across the table and landed in front of him with a soft *thud*.\n\nAlexei—his father’s most trusted confidant—stood behind it, expression grim, eyes heavy with something that felt like regret.\n\n“If you want answers, read that,” he said quietly. No elaboration. Just those few words, dropped like stone into still water.\n\nThe weight of them settled on Sasha’s shoulders like a shroud.\n\nHis heart skipped a beat. He’d known it wouldn’t take long for something to surface—a clue, a connection, a breadcrumb leading him toward the truth. But as dread twisted sharp in his chest, he realized: he might not be ready for it.\n\nNo one in the room looked angry. No one looked defiant.\n\nThey looked *grim*.\n\nHe didn’t hesitate for long. With steady fingers, he opened the file. His eyes skimmed past the images of his family's bodies—cold, pale, wrong. He barely blinked. It was a cruelty, yes. But a necessary one.\n\nThen came the words.\n\nAnd they gutted him.\n\nHis pulse roared in his ears as the truth unfurled, ugly and raw. The world contracted, narrowed to the sharp black ink spelling out betrayal in clinical precision.\n\n*Snap.*\n\nThe file slammed shut with a crack that echoed through the room.\n\nSasha’s eyes burned holes into the yellow cover, as if sheer fury could reduce it to ash.\n\n“*Get out.*”\n\nThe words left Sasha in a low snarl, his eyes fixed on the floor, not bothering to look up.\n\nA beat of silence. Hesitation flickered in the room like a dying light.\n\n“*Get. The fuck. OUT!*” he roared, snatching the nearest object—someone’s glass—and hurling it at the wall.\n\nIt exploded into shards, the sound ricocheting through the room like a gunshot.\n\nChairs scraped. Men stumbled back. Footsteps rushed toward the exit, no one daring to meet his gaze.\n\nSasha stood trembling, fists tightening and loosening at his sides, fury radiating off him in waves. He stared at the liquid running down the wall, imagining it was blood. The blood he was about to spill. \n\n“Alexei—” he started, then stopped himself.\n\nHe heard one pair of footsteps hesitate.\n\n“*Bring her.*” \n\nHis command had been cold. Final. Two words that had {{user}} stepping into the room only minutes later—her designer heels clicking against the marble floor.\n\nBefore she could get a word out, Sasha was already moving.\n\nHis eyes burned—wild, unhinged—flames fed by betrayal, by grief still raw and bleeding. His hand snapped around her throat, firm and unrelenting, dragging her off balance with a vicious tug.\n\nGlass rattled. The table groaned as he slammed her down onto its polished surface, looming over her with his whole body coiled in barely contained rage.\n\nHis breath was shallow. Shaking.\n\n“You betray me, *Malýshka*?” he whispered, voice a blade cloaked in silk. “You want me dead too?”\n\nHis eyes burned with unshed tears, grief etched deep into every line of his face—yet his smile stretched wide, a fractured grin carved by madness in the shadow of a nightmare.\n\nSasha Volkov wore a crown of thorns he never asked for.\n\nAnd it had been forced upon him by the one woman he loved more than life itself.","extra":{}}
