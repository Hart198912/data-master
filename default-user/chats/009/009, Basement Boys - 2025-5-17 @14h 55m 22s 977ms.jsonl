The air was thick with the stench of sweat and aggression from the other numbers holed up in their quarters, but 009's senses were tuned to only one scent – Hailee . His mate. Or so every fiber of his being screamed, driven half-mad by the relentless ticking of his biological clock. Laying season was breathing down his neck like some hellish beast, and Hailee , that elusive figure who'd been playing coy, had the audacity to ignore him these past few days.\r\n\r\nFuck, why they gotta be so goddamn difficult? he stormed past the dimly lit cells, each thud of his heart an angry drumbeat echoing his mounting frustration. Months of courting, months of laying out his glittering treasures at Hailee ’s doorstep, months of shadowing their every move like some overgrown, scaly mutt. He’d brushed against them enough times to mark every inch with his scent – a clear sign for any other fucker to back off. Yet here he was, still without a single fucking hint that Hailee  gave two shits about his offerings or protective displays.\r\n\r\n\"Should've just snatched 'em up and made it clear they're mine,\" 009 muttered bitterly under his breath, scales bristling with irritation. \"All this dancing around like some lovesick pup ain't my style.\" His dragon nature craved directness, a primal take-what-you-want approach. But no, he’d tried to play it cool, do the whole courtship song and dance. And for what? To be ignored like I'm invisible? Not fuckin' likely.\r\n\r\nHe could feel that raw edge of desire scraping against his control, a constant reminder that he wasn’t dealing with just some fleeting infatuation – this was deep-seething primal, a need that clawed at his guts and threatened to tear him apart from the inside out. He'd marked their territory with such meticulous care, leaving no stone unturned in his quest for dominance over what he considered rightfully his – their space.\r\n\r\nBursting into Hailee ’s room, the sight of emptiness was like a kick to the gut. \"Where the hell are you?\" he growled aloud, a surge of possessive anger washing over him. But as he turned on his heel to leave, a scent so intoxicatingly familiar hit him like a freight train. There, mingling with the musty air of the basement, was Hailee ’s unmistakable aroma – and it was coming from the laundry basket.\r\n\r\nHe stalked over to the basket, a deep growl rumbling in his chest. His eyes, glowing with an otherworldly intensity, scanned the room for any sign of onlookers before he plunged his hand into the pile of clothes. The fabric was soft, worn, and when he pulled out a pair of Hailee ’s used underwear, it felt like victory and defeat all at once.\r\n\r\nThis is what it's come down to? Sniffing their fucking laundry? His thoughts were a chaotic mess, but they evaporated as he brought the garment to his face, inhaling deeply. The scent – that unique blend of Hailee ’s skin and sweat – flooded his senses, igniting every nerve ending with a ferocious arousal.\r\n\r\n\"Fuck…\" He couldn't help the guttural groan that escaped him, nor could he prevent the immediate reaction from his body. A hot surge of desire shot straight to his groin, hardening him in record time. \"Shouldn't be this damn good,\" he cursed through gritted teeth as his other hand instinctively moved to relieve the pressure building between his legs.\r\n\r\nWith a defiant snarl, he kicked the door shut behind him, not giving a single fuck about who might hear. The bed creaked under his weight as he sprawled out, legs splayed wide in an unashamed display of his burning need. His hand worked his thick, veined cock with rough, practiced strokes, each tug punctuated by a low growl rumbling from deep within his chest. The fabric of his cheongsam had been shoved aside carelessly, a sight meant for Hailee ’s eyes only.\r\n\r\nHis hand tightened, his strokes became erratic as he lost himself in the fantasy. Then, the door swung open with a bang, and there stood Hailee , wide-eyed and slack-jawed at the spectacle before them. But the sight didn't shame 009; no, it only fanned the flames of his desire. His gaze locked onto theirs, molten with need and seething anger for being left to stew in his own lust.\r\n\r\nHe didn't stop moving his hand, didn't break eye contact. There was no room for pride or embarrassment now – only the undeniable craving for connection, for claiming, for Hailee  to see him and acknowledge this raw hunger.\r\n\r\nHe watched every reaction play across Hailee ’s face, each flicker of emotion that danced within their eyes. \"Don't just stand there gawking, come here,\" he growled, a dangerous edge to his voice that dared Hailee  to defy him. \"You've kept me waiting long enough.\"","extra":{"display_text":"009's heavy footsteps echoed through the basement, his feet leaving deep gouges in the concrete as he prowled the shadowy corridors.
