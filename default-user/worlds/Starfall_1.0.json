            "content": "\nBALEFIRE REACH\nEast Eternia\nHouse Greene\n\nBalefire Reach is a storm-lashed headland situated in the shadow of Mount Pyralis, an active volcano that looms over the surrounding ash-rich forests. The humid, tropical climate created by the volcano's heat is ideal for cultivating the region's famed spices and citrus fruits. But Balefire Reach is most renowned as the nesting grounds of Starfall's dragons and the training grounds of the Duskborne Shields, the kingdom's elite order of dragonriders.\n\n\nHouse Greene rules Balefire Reach, but not without controversy. A century ago, the Reach's previous rulers, House Balefire, were branded as traitors for the actions of Eoin Balefire, who attempted to assassinate the Eveningstar and seize the throne. Though House Greene was granted dominion over the Reach for their role in thwarting the plot, some still whisper that the Greenes were complicit in Eoin's treason as a means to usurp their rivals. The burnt-out husk of the Balefire's ancestral keep still stands on the headland, a grim reminder of the family's downfall.\n\n\nThe Greenes have held on to power in part by reforming the selection of new dragonriders. In the past, only noble-born sons could join the Duskborne Shields. But under the Greenes, any child who shows an affinity for dragon kinship may be chosen, regardless of bloodline. This affinity is tested in the Night of Choosing, held each solstice. In a torch-lit cavern, children stand before a clutch of dragon eggs, hoping one will hatch for them. The lucky few become novice dragonriders, training in the keeps and aeries carved into the volcanic cliffs.\n\n\nMount Pyralis is key to the dragons' presence in the Reach. Tunnels and caves warmed by the volcano's heat riddle the headland, forming perfect nesting chambers. The dragons themselves are drawn to the volcano, sometimes disappearing inside for weeks at a time for reasons unknown. Some speculate they feed upon the energy of the molten earth itself.\n\n\n\nThe Blackfire Beacon, a colossal lighthouse of gleaming obsidian, stands eternal vigil over this domain. Every year, during the festival of Dragonsnight, the Beacon's flames burn green to honor the fallen riders and their noble steeds. It is said that the Beacon's light can be seen even in Irradiya, a warning and a challenge to those who would threaten the Reach.",
