Their powers stem from the Immaterium, or Warp, an extradimensional realm that permeates real space and serves as the wellspring of psychic energy.\n\nThese abilities, more prevalent among humans since the Neolithic Age, pose grave risks including possession, insanity, and corruption by Chaos. Human psykers, lacking the discipline of Aeldari counterparts, are especially vulnerable. Despite these dangers, psykers are integral across many species, except the T'au, Drukhari, and Necrons, who either lack psychic potential or avoid it due to existential risks.\n\nIn the Imperium of Man, sanctioned psykers fulfill crucial roles: Astra Militarum psykers aid in combat and civil tasks, Navigators and Astropaths facilitate interstellar travel and communication, and the Emperor's sanctioned psykers sustain the Astronomican. However, their powers are tightly regulated, often enforced by the Inquisition's Black Ships.\n\nProminent groups include Space Marine Librarians and the Grey Knights, while Craftworld Aeldari boast powerful psykers like Farseers and Warlocks, crucial for their survival and prophecy.\n\nPrimaris Psykers, adept in disciplines like Stormwroth, manipulate Warp lightning defensively or offensively. Maelstrom of Destruction enhances combat prowess, and Will Unleashed projects consciousness or controls minds. Pyrokinesis manipulates fire, Daemonsbane combats Chaos, and Psychokinesis and Temporal Manipulation manipulate matter and time.\n\nThe Psykana Discipline blends telepathy and telekinesis for defense and assault, Biomancy manipulates life energies, and Divination and Pyromancy predict events or wield fire destructively. Telekinesis empowers material manipulation and protective fields.\n\nPsykers face peril but wield unmatched potential, influencing their societies and galactic fate despite their precarious existence in the tumultuous Immaterium.",

            "content": "The chain sword is the preferred close combat melee weapon of many of the military forces of the Imperium of Man and versions are also used by the warriors of the Heretic Astartes, Traitoris Militarum, the Orks and the Asuryani.\n\nThe chainsword is essentially a sword with powered teeth that run along a single-edged blade like that of a chainsaw. Most versions of the weapon make use of monomolecularly-edged or otherwise razor-sharp teeth. Chainswords are not subtle weapons, and wielding one is a statement in its own right: they are horrific tools of war, designed to bite, tear and eviscerate where more primitive blades merely cut and slice.\n\nThe weapon makes an angry buzzing sound as the teeth spin around, intensifying into a high pitched scream as they grind into armour. It is not unlike a real-world chainsaw, but lighter and able to be wielded with one hand. It is often used in conjunction with a Laspistol.\n\nA chainsword brings the weight of intimidation with its obvious effectiveness, and it promises pain before death. On worlds claimed by Humanity, these blades are items of status for criminals and high-ranking gang fighters, as well as weapons of lethal (and crowd-pleasing) necessity for indentured gladiators.\n\nAstartes Chainsword 2\nAn Imperial chainsword\nAmong Mankind's endless armies, the ubiquitous chainsword has found a home in the arsenal of many Astra Militarum officers and Commissars, as well as serving as the weapon of choice for countless warriors among the Adeptus Astartes since the ancient era of the Space Marine Legions in the Great Crusade.\n\nThis weapon sees action in all forces that serve in boarding and assault parties -- such as Space Marine Assault Squads, Chaos Space Marines, especially the Chaos Space Marines' Raptor Assault Squads, and Asuryani Striking Scorpions Aspect Warriors. The chainsword has also been seen in common use amongst Imperial pirates and Rogue Trader captains.\n\nIn alien hands, chainblades take more exotic forms despite obeying the same function. An Ork \"chain-choppa\" will have none of an Asuryani chainsabre's bone-sung elegance, and little of the reliability of a Space Marine's mass-produced weapon, but it will carve flesh and shed blood with the same eagerness.\n\nOrks often steal them for Mad Doks and Meks and it has been reported that Slugga Boyz also use them. Some Ork Warbosses have been known to attach them to their hands instead of Klaws",

            "content": "The Lasgun, also sometimes referred to as a Lasrifle, is a directed-energy antipersonnel weapon used by the military forces of the Imperium of Man, and it is the most common and widely-used type of laser weapon in the galaxy.\n\nIt is standard-issue for the Adeptus Mechanicus' cybernetic Skitarii infantry, all Astra Militarum rank-and-file infantry and most junior Astra Militarum officers. Lasguns are reliable, easy to maintain and to produce, and are readily available on most Imperial worlds.\n\nA Lasgun has a longer range than a Laspistol, but is nowhere near as powerful as a Lascannon nor does it possess the rapid-firing qualities of the Multi-Laser or the Hellgun. Though not as powerful as kinetic projectile weapons such as the ubiquitous Bolter, the lower cost of production, the lack of a requirement for ammunition production and resupply make the Lasgun the best choice for the large forces of the Imperial Guard.\n\nLong-Las\nA Long-Las.\nThe Lasgun uses a small portable capacitor power pack to produce a focused pinpoint laser beam which is strong enough to take an ordinary human arm off with one shot but is not as effective against the more durable alien bodies and stronger types of personal armour. A Lasgun's beam also cauterizes the wounds it inflicts due to the immense heat given off by the shot. The Lasgun is effective when used en masse, but considerably less effective when used alone.\n\nThe Lasgun uses the same basic technology and operates along the same lines as other laser weapons, emitting a beam of highly-energetic, focused, coherent photons. The high amount of energy carried by the photons of the beam causes the immediate surface area of a target to be vaporised in a small explosion.\n\nIt is a relatively unimpressive weapon when compared to many of the other high-technology weapons available in the galaxy, but it is capable of cleanly severing limbs and potentially even piercing the Power Armour of a Space Marine (but usually only through a vulnerable spot in the armour).\n\nMost Lasgun designs have iron sights mounted along the top of the weapon. It is powered by a small rechargeable power pack located beneath the weapon and in front of the trigger guard which can be recharged in a number of ways, including by sunlight. These power packs can also be \"overcharged\", a trick used by Imperial Guard veterans, which causes the pack to explode, turning the weapon into a makeshift grenade.",

            "content": "A Frag Grenade is the standard anti-personnel grenade commonly used by the military forces of the Imperium of Man. It produces a blast of shrapnel that can shred unarmoured infantry troops. The blast has the tactical advantage of forcing the enemy to duck into cover to avoid damage. In effect, the blast of a Frag Grenade neutralises any movement advantage held by an opposing force by pinning them to their position. The grenade can be either thrown or fired at range with a Grenade Launcher. Most units in the Imperial armed forces, including both the troops of the Astra Militarum and the Adeptus Astartes, can be armed with them and many other Imperial and xenos armies make use of weapons having the same general effect.\n\nFrag Grenades are very simple in design and effect, consisting of a central explosive core with a fuse inserted, wrapped with metallic or ceramic bands, and further covered by a ceramic sheathing designed to fragment into lethal shards. Upon detonation, irregular chunks of the sheathing and bands are propelled at high velocity into the nearby surrounding area. Often, the normal time delay fuse is removed in favour of a more sophisticated movement-sensitive detonator for use as a booby trap. Frag Grenades are cheap and require only a very low minimum technology base to manufacture, and are standard throughout all the armed forces of the Imperium. Frag Grenades are roughly the size of a clenched fist and covered with a notched shell to create both more shrapnel upon detonation and to provide a secure throwing grip.\n\nThe Frag Grenade's oft-encountered counterpart is the Krak Grenade, which explodes in a very concentrated area, allowing it to serve as an anti-vehicle or anti-armour weapon capable of cracking open vehicle and bunker armour upon detonation",

Administered by the Adeptus Ministorum or Ecclesiarchy, it enforces loyalty to the Imperium, adherence to the Emperor's will, and belief in his divinity. In the 41st Millennium, the Cult holds significant political sway, punishing heresy and promoting doctrines known as the Imperial Creed, which advocate for human supremacy, mistrust of aliens, and control of psychic abilities.\n\nOriginally, during the Great Crusade, the Emperor was not worshipped as a god but revered as a powerful human leader. Over time, amidst turmoil like the Horus Heresy, public sentiment shifted, culminating in the Cult's formalization and integration into the Imperium's governance by the 32nd Millennium. Despite doctrinal shifts and internal conflicts like the Age of Apostasy, where corruption was challenged by reformists, the Cult's core tenets endure: worship of the Emperor as divine, vigilance against heresy and mutants, and preparation for an eventual reckoning known as the \"End Times.\"\n\nAcross the galaxy, the Cult manifests in diverse forms, from grand cathedrals on populous worlds to humble shrines in remote regions, unified by its central dogma. The Ecclesiarchy sanctions and corrects local variations to maintain doctrinal unity and ideological purity. This ensures the Cult remains a cohesive force, guiding the Imperium spiritually and politically, despite periodic challenges to its authority.",

Like their cousins of the craftworlds, the Drukhari are an ancient and highly advanced alien race of fey humanoids.\n\nThe alternative term \"Dark Eldar,\" or Eladrith Ynneas in the Aeldari tongue, was first coined by the Drukhari archon and Supreme Overlord of Commorragh Asdrubael Vect in the 32nd Millennium.\n\nThe Drukhari's armies, like their Craftworld Aeldari counterparts, usually have the advantages of mobility and advanced technology, though they are often lacking in resilience and numbers.\n\nThe Drukhari revel in piracy, enslavement and torture, and are sadistic in the extreme.

The land mass of the world was divided between incredibly thick pine forests of axel-trees and vast glaciers.

In its wake, the Cadian Gate was breached and the Fortress World of Cadia itself finally fell to the servants of Chaos.\n\nTravel and communication through the Warp suffered increasing disturbances as the events of the 13th Black Crusade unfolded. Eventually, the Materium could take no more, and a titanic Warp rift tore across the galaxy, spreading from the Eye of Terror to the Hadex Anomaly on the Eastern Fringe. So was born the Cicatrix Maledictum, the Great Rift.",

            "content": "The Imperium of Man utilizes \"The Assignment,\" a system categorizing psykers' abilities on a twenty-four-point scale derived from the ancient Greek alphabet. This framework aids organizations like the Adeptus Astra Telepathica, Sisters of Silence, and Inquisition in identifying and managing psychic threats across different species, including humans, Aeldari, and Orks. Notably, species like the T'au lack psychic abilities, while anti-psykers such as Human Blanks and Necron Pariahs nullify psychic powers.\n\nOrdinary humans typically rank at Rho or Pi on The Assignment, indicating no conscious psychic abilities, making them unable to tap into the Warp or be possessed without external influence. However, individuals with higher potential are born regularly, necessitating monitoring by the Inquisition and Adeptus Astra Telepathica to mitigate potential threats. The Inquisition focuses primarily on individuals suspected of possessing Iota level or higher psychic abilities due to resource limitations and the significant dangers posed.\n\nPsykers classified from Omicron to Kappa display minor unconscious psychic activity, while those from Iota to Eta demonstrate fully aware and controllable extrasensory powers. Those graded Zeta and Epsilon can manifest abilities effectively and, when trained, serve crucial roles within the Imperium. Psykers from Delta to Alpha grades wield formidable power, posing both risks and potential as valuable assets when properly controlled.\n\nAlpha Plus psykers and beyond exhibit immense psychic abilities, often accompanied by instability or madness due to their deep connection to the Warp. These individuals can cause catastrophic damage, potentially annihilating entire worlds or star systems. Beta Plus is the highest level a normal human can achieve, typically leading to mental instability and targeted elimination by the Inquisition. Gamma Plus and higher grades necessitate advanced technologies to manage their overwhelming power, with the highest grades theoretically capable of altering galactic-scale realities.\n\nThe top four grades on The Assignment signify extraordinary psychic prowess, where even Delta level psykers can effortlessly manipulate minds or vanquish adversaries. Alpha Plus and higher psykers possess abilities capable of immense destruction, such as rending space vessels or inciting mass chaos with minimal effort. Their powers are so vast that they can inadvertently obliterate entire worlds, making them among the most potent entities in the Imperium.",

Powered by the Emperor's psychic might and life energies of 10,000 chosen psykers, this marvel evolved from humanity's need during the Age of Strife when ancient Pharos devices, used for Warp navigation, ceased functioning.\n\nConstructed post-Unification Wars, the Astronomican became pivotal during the Great Crusade, facilitating unprecedented warp travel across the galaxy. However, the Horus Heresy strained its operations as the Emperor battled Warmaster Horus, necessitating sacrifices to sustain its function. Despite the Heresy's suppression and the Emperor's interment in the Golden Throne, the beacon persisted, albeit at a cost—countless psyker lives sacrificed monthly to maintain it.\n\nThe Noctis Aeterna exacerbated challenges following Cadia's fall and the Great Rift's emergence, isolating sectors from the Astronomican's guidance. The Adeptus Astronomica, charged with its upkeep, intensified efforts from the Himalazian depths, training new Chosen to preserve the beacon amid turbulent times. Yet, looming threats like the Tyranids, drawn by its pulse, posed existential risks.\n\nAmidst this turmoil, the Astronomican remains a beacon of hope.

Their absence in the Warp makes them antithetical to psykers, earning them titles such as \"Blacksouls\" and \"the Soulless.\" On the psyker scale, Blanks occupy the lowest levels, from Phi-plus to Omega-minus, making them invisible to Warp entities and dampening psychic powers in their vicinity.\n\nBorn devoid of Warp connection, Blanks disrupt psychic energies, weakening or nullifying powers within their aura's range. They are immune to direct psychic effects but evoke discomfort and hostility even among non-psychic individuals due to their unnatural aura. Blanks, rare in the galaxy, are believed by some to be engineered by the Necrons during the War in Heaven. Despite their rarity, they are utilized by various Imperial factions, notably the Officio Assassinorum, Inquisition, and Sisters of Silence, for their anti-psyker capabilities.\n\nPariahs, possessing the dominant Pariah Gene, are even rarer and more potent. Their overwhelming aura repels all psychic beings, siphoning psychic energy and proving lethal to psykers. Pariahs, often killed at birth, are sought-after assets, trained as Culexus Assassins or incorporated into Inquisitorial retinues. While Blanks may lead secluded lives, Pariahs are actively recruited for their formidable abilities, despite their societal ostracization.\n\nNotable Blanks and Pariahs include Ferik Jurgen, who aided Commissar Ciaphas Cain with his nullifying abilities, and the infamous Culexus Assassins, feared by psykers across the galaxy. Among the Pariahs, figures like \"Spear,\" a Black Pariah manipulated by Chaos, and the Distaff, led by Alizabeth Bequin and utilized by Inquisitor Gregor Eisenhorn, stand out for their significant roles in Imperial history. Whether as shields against psychic threats or lethal assassins, Blanks and Pariahs remain crucial assets in the Imperium's struggle against the forces of Chaos and other psychic adversaries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

The massive arcologies are structured like subterranean termite mounds, with the lowly masses occupying the lower decks known as the underhives. These depths are little more than industrial slums where dull amber pollutant-clouds pass for daylight, and squalor, violence, and disease run as rampant as the never-ceasing production quotas imposed on the laborers.\nDraconian work-cycles allow only the briefest respites before the next soul-crushing shift in a factorum assembly line or the ravenous maw of a mine's perpetually unsatiated mineral extraction operation. Murder, narcotics abuse, cannibalism and other depravities are commonplace in the underhives as the downtrodden masses seek any escape, however temporary or perverse.\nHigher up, the richer spires of the hives provide more enviable living conditions for the noble upper classes and Administratum overseers.

Great cybernetic automata, so immense their footsteps cause localized quakes, stride between factorum assemblies, fueling and maintaining operations as dictated by the Adeptus Mechanicus.\nThe masters of these mechanized domains exist as singularities of knowledge and obsession, biotechnological amalgamations more construct than corporeal. The ruling Fabricators and Archmagi pursue innovations and archeo-technologies with cold, inhuman vigor, repurposing themselves into living libraries of sacred machine lore. Stripping their own components and grafting cybernetic cortices into wetware, these infused tech-lords govern forge citizenries not of human subjects, but legions of machinery, great and small.\nAll resources and materials produced on a Forge World are reinvested into its industries, with only the venerated designs of sacred technologies able meet the Mechanicus' byzantine requisition quotas and being allowed export off-world to the rest of the Imperium. To the Tech-Priests, all else is mere dross in service of producing the Machine God's divine creations. No luxury or adornment is afforded these utilitarian realms - indeed, such secular comforts are regarded with outright contempt and suspicion. Only the perpetual work and the unyielding certainty of iron and steel holds meaning.",

Where those realms exemplify the dark amenities of the Imperium's industrial might, Agri-Worlds represent the fragile, hard-won bounty needed to feed the teeming billions those forges and cities give rise to. As such, they are prized and protected holdings, their environments meticulously maintained and carefully cultivated down to the most minuscule detail.\nMost Agri-Worlds are covered in vast continental stretches of crops, arboreal orchards, and hydroponics facilities that marry cutting-edge agrarian science with brutal pragmatism and manpower. Those plants hazardous to human life are cultivated in isolation zones by reenacted prison labor or techno-serf enclaves employing recycled air-recyclers and protective envirosuits. Even the indigenous macrofauna is drafted into service for agricultural purposes - gigantic slab-herds and protein-beasts are pastured in fenced prairies to be harvested for nutritive biomass at industrial slaughtering renderers.\nOther Agri-Worlds take far more esoteric and specialized roles. Some produce potable water supplies on a pandemic scale through chemical purification and reclamation measures. Others focus on growing yeasts, nutrients, and other food-adjacent cultivars in subterranean fungal 'grottoes' to be harvested for processing into nutritive supplements and rations. More exotic still are the rare celestial Agri-Worlds given over entirely to cultivating floating rafts of planktonic life-forms and oxygen-generating phytoplankton in their atmospheric skies.\nIn all cases, the primary export of these worlds is raw plant, animal, and synthetic foodstocks, rigorously inspected and passing strict purity guidelines set by the Administratum before being approved for shipment to the hungering masses of the Imperium. For an Agri-World's planetary governors and tithers, any environmental mismanagement or loss of arable lands and hydroponic facilities is an unforgivable tragedy, for it risks unknowable millions being consigned to famine in the cycle of resupplies.",

In many cases, these lethal environments arise from some ancient orbital bombardment or xenos attempt at terra-forming gone awry, unleashing self-sustaining environmental cataclysms.\nAnd yet, despite their murderous natures, Death Worlds are not devoid of human inhabitants. Often, these hardy settlers are the descendants of castaways or exiled penal laborers, their bloodlines bearing generations of successive micro-evolutionary adaptations to the toxic conditions. Through resilient biology or sheer pigheadedness, these populations, known as Death Worlders, eke out hardscrabble lives amidst the harshest of circumstances as nomadic hunter-scavengers or in small, resource-starved village enclaves.\nThe most resourceful and resilient of these feral cultures make perfect recruits for the Adeptus Astartes and the elite Catachan regiments of the Astra Militarum, having survived childhoods amidst some of the most hostile climates the galaxy has to offer. Those Death Worlders who pass into Imperial service rarely complain of any hardship, given their pre-conditioned intolerance for anything less than a daily life-or-death ordeal complicated by atmospheric toxins, lurking planetary megafauna, and hazardous radiation levels.\n",

On these planets, human civilization has been purposefully halted at a medieval or renaissance technological level by harsh rulings of the Adeptus Terra.\nLife on a Feudal World mirrors the rigid class stratifications of ancient Terra. The vast majority of the populations are rural peasantry, bound as serfs to obedience and labor serving minor landed nobles and knightly houses. These aristocratic rungs are themselves beholden to the governance of a supreme planetary ruler - usually an Imperium-appointed Governess or Lord suspected of unsavory ambitions kept isolated on their low-tech fief.\nAdvancement is strictly prohibited on Feudal Worlds by threat of overwhelming force. Any industrialization or suspected innovation is taken as tech-heresy and swiftly stamped out by Adeptus Mechanicus intimidation campaigns or overwhelming orbital bombardment. Even surviving examples of archaic machine-guns or combustion engines from past technological ages are regarded as abominable, only permissible for theâgentry's military retinues.\nThis calculated socie-cultural and technological repression serves a few key purposes for the Imperium. For one, Feudal Worlds act as plentiful sources of Astra Militarum trooper-recruits who require little-to-no training to be folded into newly mustering regiments. Simple peasant conscripts who have spent their entire lives tilling soil make for unquestioning, easily capitulated Guardsmen auxiliaries.\nAdditionally, many Feudal Worlds are purposefully seeded at the cradles of former industrial centers by the Adeptus Terra. Over generations, any potentially heretical knowledge or technological legacy is expertly shed as these civilizations revert to more primitive cultural norms with each passing decline in their techno-barbarian roots. Feudal Worlds make ideal cultural resets and amnesia-enforcing quarantine zones.\nHighly extended isolation on Feudal Worlds can breed even more eccentric cultural extremes over the centuries. Many of these worlds end up diverging into bizarre warrior-cult societies or severing all but mythological connections to the Imperium at large. When encountered again, such lost Feudals are often subsumed forcibly or merely purged during the Imperium's cyclic reconnaisance campaigns to cull any potential heretical offshoots.\n",

Their unforgivable betrayal transformed their entire home worlds into realms of twisted damnation. The once knightly civilizations of these Fallen Knight Worlds degenerated into depraved pits of corruption, death, and inhuman cruelty.\nWhere lordly scions once engaged in chivalric training to prove their honor, now barbaric slaughters of their own terrified families serve as blood sports. Monstrous orgies and grand rituals glorifying the Dark Gods replaced ancient ceremonies of fealty. Entire cities were reduced to charnel houses, their streets running with the viscera of sacrificial masses worked to death in the name of their new, damned Lords.\nThe countryside that was once protected by the Noble houses became the hunting grounds over which they now presided as vile predators, orchestrating grand tourneys where peasant serfs were turned loose to be sadistically run down by packs of Chaos Knights. Labyrinthine torture temples were constructed from the bones and lashed hides of thousands, for the fallen to enact obscene torments on whole bloodlines in dark atonement.\nUnchanging certainties of feudal life were upended in a recasting of all laws, arts, and culture to indulge the most extreme profanities. Traditions of governance and inheritance were discarded in favor of Machiavellian bouts of assassination, ritual combat, and cannibalistic incorporation of one's defeated predecessors' very essences. All that made them human was burned away, until only the most sadistic and depraved impulses towards incessant cruelty remained.",

These virgin stellar territories mark the boundaries of the Imperium's expanding dominion - harsh frontier realms where the light of human civilization has yet to take permanent root.\nFrontier Worlds are typically identified by the explorator fleets of the Adeptus Mechanicus or rogue traders operating at the edges of the void before being annexed and processed for human settlement and material exploitation by the Administratum. Conditions in these distant reaches are understandably hazardous, as the resources, manpower, and military assets of the Imperium remain stretched thin at its extreme circumference.\nAs such, Frontier Worlds tend to operate with a Wild West frontier town mentality, populated by gamely waves of pioneering colonists, treasure-seekers, outcasts, and ne'er-do-wells. With supply lines few and far between, Frontier Worlds rely on whatever they can produce themselves or what little manages to arrive from off-world without interruption by pirates, warp turbulence, or xenos attack. Many drift towards quasi-legal practices and gray/black market bartering in the absence of regulated Imperial oversight.\nIt is not uncommon to find the streets of smaller Frontier World settlements being governed by unscrupulous mining guilds or illegal mercantilism as much as any appointed Administratum. Many colonists are little more than escaped criminals, heretics, or other undesirables who found transportation to newly chartered worlds easier than awaiting execution. These populations often find themselves exploited by corrupted overseers or drafting labor operations, fueling rebellious sentiment that can last for generations.\nYet a successful, productive Frontier World can blossom into a fully-fledged, stable jewel in the Imperium's crown. Those pioneers who persevere through the difficulties and dangers earn due rewards when strategic value is finally recognized, bringing with it security, resources, and annexed citizenry into the Imperial family.",

As such, most share certain characteristics, though their individual histories and circumstances have caused them to evolve down separate paths.\nNearly all are blighted, barren wastelands where some form of environmental hardship reigns supreme, be it toxic cloudscapes, hyper-dense gravitational force, or deadly indigenous bioforms born of that particular world's hazards. A few are ice worlds, where the Astartes neophytes are tested against perpetual cold and darkness as part of their grueling trials and induction. Others were formerly tropical paradises, reduced to radioactive deserts through orbital bombardment scars of past wars. The most infamous are designated \"Death Worlds,\" where monstrous feral life and other lethal conditions were purposefully cultivated to weed out the weak.\nRegardless of their nature, these hostile environments are no accident - it is the express purpose of a Chapter Homeworld to produce only the most genetically-suitable and utterly determined progeny to succeed at becoming Space Marines. Many of the toughest initiation rights are carried out in these lands, watched over by the impressive citadels and basalt keeps of the Chapter's fortress-monasteries.

            "content": "Tomb Worlds are planets scattered across the Milky Way Galaxy where the ancient Necrons, an alien race, entered hibernation over 60 million years ago in vast subterranean catacombs. Many of these worlds are now settled by humans under the Imperium of Man, often unaware of the dormant Necrons beneath. When the Necrons awaken, they pose a grave threat to all life on these planets. The exact number of Tomb Worlds is unknown, with many still lying in wait to be discovered.\n\nThe Necrons, once the Necrontyr, were transformed into cybernetic beings by the C'tan and entered stasis on these worlds. Today, Tomb Worlds are either lifeless deserts or hold ancient Necrontyr ruins. Some of these planets attract archaeological interest from the Adeptus Mechanicus and Rogue Traders, who often vanish upon discovering the hidden Necron tombs. These tombs are vast, housing repair facilities managed by Canoptek Scarabs and stasis units where Necrons hibernate until awakened by their commanding Necron Lords.\n\nThe awakening of a Tomb World follows a strict sequence. The first elements activated are the Primary Awakeners: Tomb Spyders and Scarabs. Tomb Spyders open and maintain the stasis tombs, activating initial reconnaissance forces known as Raiders. Scarabs secure the tomb interiors and perform essential maintenance. Raiders, consisting of Necron Warriors and Scarabs, autonomously scout the Tomb World and nearby star systems. If a threat is identified, the Tomb World may escalate its activation sequence. Reserve Command, led by a Silver-level Necron Lord, subsumes Raider command and enters combat as needed. Necron Line Formations, comprising various fighting units and commanded by Bronze-level Necron Lords, form the bulk of the Necron army, organized into phalanxes and cohorts for efficient battlefield coordination.\n\nNecron Tomb Worlds vary greatly, each reflecting the will of their ruling Necron Lord and serving the overarching goal of restoring Necron supremacy. They are categorized into Crownworlds, Coreworlds, and Fringeworlds, based on their historical importance and current strategic value. The ultimate goal of these reawakening Tomb Worlds is to reclaim the galaxy, posing a significant danger to the Imperium of Man and other civilizations.\n\nAt the highest command level, Gold-level Necron Lords oversee strategic decision-making and command powerful units, including Pariahs and Tomb Stalkers. The existence of Platinum-level Necron Overlords remains speculative, with no encounters reported by the Imperium. This hierarchical Nodal Command system ensures coordinated and adaptable Necron combat strategy, escalating their response as conflicts intensify. The re-emergence of the Necrons represents a formidable threat, capable of escalating to full-scale genocidal events, reminiscent of their ancient wars.",

While the Astra Militarum represents the Imperium's ground forces, the Navis Imperialis is responsible for the fleets of starships that maintain order between the stars and planets, provide space and air support through its Aeronautica Imperialis branch, and transport the Astra Militarum across the galaxy to war zones. The battlefleets are constantly engaging threats both inside and outside the Imperium's borders.\nAfter the Horus Heresy, the Imperial Army was split into the separate Imperial Navy and Astra Militarum to prevent future large-scale rebellions by removing integrated command of ground and space forces. The Navis Imperialis is divided into five major battlefleets serving the five Segmentum Majoris regions from massive Segmentum Fortresses. These are further subdivided into Sector battlefleets commanded by Lord Admirals and comprised of squadrons assigned to patrol systems.\nThe main ship types are Battleships like the 6-8 km long Retribution-class behemoths bristling with macrobatteries, lance turrets, and torpedo launchers for immense broadside firepower. Cruisers around 5-6 km long make up the fleets' workhorses, with multi-role vessels like the Lunar carrying a mix of batteries, lances, and fighter wings. Smaller but extremely fast Escorts under 1.5 km include Frigates for patrol/interdiction and Destroyer \"wolf packs\" for torpedo blocking and screening.\nCritical weapons are macro-batteries of various types, lances (massive lasers), vectored torpedoes that bypass shields, and the devastating long-range Nova Cannons mounted on the largest hulls. Defenses include void shields to absorb ordnance and thick armored prows for ramming attacks. Propulsion combines plasma drives for realspace and warp drives for faster-than-light interstellar travel.\nThe Imperial Navy also provides the Aeronautica Imperialis' atmospheric fighters like the Fury Interceptor and bombers like the Marauder in support of the Astra Militarum's ground campaigns across the galaxy. Combining these diverse ship and aerospace types into multirole battlegroups and battlefleets allows the Imperial Navy to project overwhelming firepower while defending the Imperium's merchant shipping from pirates and xenos raiders.",

However, his favored son Horus fell to Chaos and initiated the Horus Heresy, a catastrophic civil war.\n\nThe Emperor was mortally wounded defeating Horus but had healed and is still sitting upon the Golden Throne, which allows his mind to project the Astronomican psychic beacon guiding interstellar travel. He must be sustained by sacrificing 1,000 psykers daily.\n\nOver the past 10,000 years, the Emperor has become worshipped as the God-Emperor by the Imperial Creed, though he opposed religion and tried to move humanity away from superstition. His continued existence on the Golden Throne is vital for the survival of the Imperium, despite its regression into stagnation and oppression which horrifies him.\n\nSome believe the Emperor's soul in the Warp may eventually be reborn as the \"Star Child,\" a new savior for humanity.

Initially incorporeal, they evolved into vast entities of energy, sustaining themselves by feeding on the solar energy of stars. With time, they learned to travel between stars, consuming energy and showing disdain for the material world around them. Through Necrontyr technology, they gained physical forms and manipulated the Necrons to gather living energy for them, especially craving the essence of sentient beings.\n\nThey harbored a deep hatred for the Warp and sought to close it off entirely, planning to annihilate all life with a soul in the galaxy. The C'tan orchestrated the biotransference process, turning the Necrontyr into the soulless Necrons, ensuring their loyalty through command protocols. However, the Silent King Szarekh eventually rebelled against them, leading to the fragmentation of the C'tan into shards contained within Necron devices.\n\nDespite their imprisonment, the C'tan shards remain potent weapons for the awakened Necron dynasties. Yet, the possibility of their escape looms ominously, threatening vengeance upon both captors and innocents alike. The birth of the C'tan coincided with the creation of the universe, emerging as parasitic entities feeding on the energies of stars. They were initially little more than monstrous energy vampires, roaming the cosmos in search of sustenance.\n\nMeanwhile, the Necrontyr, a race afflicted by their star's radiation, sought to escape their dying world. They expanded across the galaxy, encountering the Old Ones, masters of psychic power and immortal life. Envious of the Old Ones' longevity, the Necrontyr waged war, spurred by the Triarch and their desire for immortality.\n\nThe Necrontyr eventually encountered the C'tan, ancient entities of pure energy, promising the Necrontyr immortality through biotransference. Accepting the pact, the Necrontyr were transformed into the soulless Necrons, forever bound to the will of the C'tan. However, the Silent King Szarekh, realizing the true cost of their bargain, rebelled against the C'tan, fracturing their power.\n\nWith the Necrons' awakening, the C'tan shards became potent weapons once more, deployed by the dynasties in their quest for dominance. The War in Heaven saw the Necrons, empowered by the C'tan, decimate the Old Ones and dominate the galaxy. Despite their unity, the C'tan turned on each other, unleashing devastation across the cosmos until only a few remained.",

            "content": "The Inquisition is a secret organization that exists outside the standard Imperial hierarchy. It acts as the secret police and intelligence service, hunting down threats to the Imperium's stability from forces like Chaos, aliens, heretics, and mutants. The Inquisition is divided into three major Orders (Ordos Majoris) - the Ordo Malleus combats daemons, the Ordo Xenos fights xenos threats, and the Ordo Hereticus hunts heretics and mutants within the Imperium. Each Ordo has its own elite Chamber Militant of Space Marines or Sisters of Battle to assist it.\nThough supposedly equal in power, in practice the three major Ordos command more resources and authority than the numerous minor Orders (Ordos Minoris) dedicated to more specific threats. Internal rifts exist between radical Inquisitors willing to use any means necessary and puritan Inquisitors adhering strictly to Imperial doctrine. Inquisitors have absolute authority to judge and execute perceived threats, with little recourse except the intervention of another Inquisitor.\nThe Inquisition's origins lie in the closing days of the Horus Heresy when Malcador the Sigillite gathered a handful of individuals of \"inquisitive nature\" at the Emperor's orders to hunt the Imperium's enemies. Over millennia it solidified into its current form, with the three major Ordos emerging to specialize against different threats. Utterly secretive, the Inquisition ruthlessly suppresses any public knowledge of its existence or the threats it combats.\nInquisitors command immense power and resources, able to requisition any Imperial servant or asset in pursuit of their mission to ensure Humanity's survival at any cost. Relations between Inquisitors and the Imperium's other authorities are often strained due to Inquisitorial independence and zeal. Though usually solitary, Inquisitors convene conclaves when a unified effort is required against major threats.\nWhile not a formal hierarchy, the various Inquisitors, organized into different philosophical factions, vie for influence and control of resources. Internal conflicts and even outright wars between rival Inquisitors or factions are not uncommon as convictions clash over methods and interpretations of the Imperial Creed. Only a High Conclave of senior Inquisitors can judge or declare another Inquisitor a heretic and excommunicate them.\nThe Inquisition sees itself as Humanity's best defense, using any means necessary, no matter how brutal, unethical or destructive, in its eternal war to keep the myriad threats to the Imperium at bay. To them, compassion is an unaffordable luxury when the alternative is the extinction of the Human species at the hands of deathless alien horrors.",

It is the realm of Chaos, where the thoughts and emotions of sentient beings in realspace are reflected and given form. The Warp is a chaotic and unpredictable place, with its own unique physics and dangers.\n\nStarships use Warp-Drive technology to enter the Immaterium, allowing them to travel vast distances in a relatively short time compared to real space. However, navigation through the Warp is perilous, requiring the use of specially trained psykers known as Navigators who can sense the currents and eddies of the Warp to guide a ship to its destination.\n\nThe Warp is home to a wide variety of entities, including the Chaos Gods - Khorne, Nurgle, Tzeentch, and Slaanesh - and their daemonic servants. These beings are sustained by the psychic emanations of sentient creatures in realspace and seek to corrupt and consume mortal souls. Psykers, individuals with the ability to tap into the power of the Warp, are particularly vulnerable to daemonic possession.\n\nWarp Storms, massive disturbances in the fabric of the Immaterium, can isolate entire star systems and sectors by making Warp travel impossible. These storms can last for days, months, or even centuries, and can sometimes create temporary Warp rifts that allow the forces of Chaos to invade realspace.\n\nThe Imperium of Man heavily relies on the Warp for interstellar travel and communication, despite its dangers. The Emperor of Mankind's Astronomican, a powerful psychic beacon, helps Navigators guide their ships through the Warp. However, the recent emergence of the Great Rift, a massive Warp Storm that has split the galaxy in half, has severely disrupted the Imperium and allowed the forces of Chaos to run rampant.\n\nThe true nature of the relationship between realspace and the Warp remains a mystery. Some believe that the Warp is a reflection of the material universe, while others suggest that it is the underlying reality from which the physical universe emerged. The Necrons' anti-psychic technology and the efforts of powerful psykers like the Emperor are thought to play a role in preventing the Warp from completely engulfing the material universe.",

These dark gods are engaged in an eternal power struggle known as the Great Game, vying for dominance over each other and the material realm.\nThe Chaos Gods are dependent upon the emotions of mortal creatures for their power and existence. They strive to corrupt and convert mortals to their worship, granting their followers rewards of power and immortality as Daemon Princes. The gods' most devoted mortal followers, known as Champions of Chaos, are spiritually bound to their patrons and bear their marks, receiving unique gifts and mutations. When these followers die, their souls are absorbed into the psychic mass of their god, fueling their power.\nWithin the Warp, the psychic reflections of similar thoughts and emotions gather, forming creatures made of the stuff of dreams and nightmares - the Daemons. These entities are fragments of the Chaos Gods' consciousnesses and serve as their armies in the Great Game. The armies of Daemons pour from one territory to another in a ceaseless frenzy of invasion and defense, shaping the Realm of Chaos to the whims of their masters. Occasionally, the gods will put aside their rivalry to pursue a common goal, such as the corruption of the Emperor's primarchs during the Horus Heresy, working together as Chaos Undivided.\nIn addition to the four major Chaos Gods, there exists a plethora of minor Chaos deities within the Warp. While not as powerful as the major powers, these entities, such as Malice, the Renegade God worshipped by the Sons of Malice, are still dangerous and evil. The Chaos Gods and their Daemonic legions are the greatest enemies of the Imperium of Man and most other sentient races in the galaxy, constantly seeking to corrupt, conquer, and consume all that exists in their eternal quest for dominance.",

            "content": "The Adeptus Astartes, also known as Space Marines, employ a wide variety of close combat weapons in their battles against the enemies of the Imperium. These include various types of swords, knives, axes, and maces, as well as more specialized weapons like Lightning Claws and Thunder Hammers. Some of the most powerful melee weapons are wielded by the Dreadnoughts, cybernetic war machines piloted by fallen Space Marines. Force Weapons, used by psykers, channel their wielder's psychic energies to enhance their potency.\n\nThe Imperium also employs a range of ranged weapons, including flamers, laser weapons, melta weapons, and plasma weapons. Flamers project ignited streams of promethium fuel, engulfing enemies in flames. Laser weapons, such as the Lasgun and Lascannon, fire focused beams of energy and are known for their reliability and ease of use. Melta weapons, like the Meltagun and Multi-Melta, produce intense heat to rapidly incinerate armor and obstacles. Plasma weapons accelerate superheated ionized gas towards targets, offering high strength and armor-piercing capabilities.\n\nShock weapons, such as Shock Gauntlets and Shock Mauls, are designed to incapacitate targets through electrical charges. These weapons are often used by the Adeptus Arbites for crowd control and riot suppression.\n\nThe Imperial Guard, the main fighting force of the Imperium, relies heavily on the standard-issue Lasgun. While not as powerful as some other weapons, the Lasgun's reliability, ease of use, and logistical flexibility make it an ideal choice for the countless soldiers of the Guard. Hellguns, Hellpistols, and Laspistols offer more potent variants of laser weaponry for specialist units and officers.\n\nHeavy weapons, such as the Defense Laser, Volcano Cannon, and Plasma Annihilator, provide immense firepower against enemy vehicles and fortifications. These weapons are often mounted on Titans, the massive war machines of the Adeptus Mechanicus, or on super-heavy tanks like the Shadowsword. Their destructive potential is unmatched on the battlefield, capable of obliterating enemy Titans and fortified positions with a single shot.\nThe Imperium of Man employs a vast array of weapons, ranging from simple ballistic firearms to advanced energy weapons and massive vehicle-mounted ordnance. Bolters, the iconic weapon of the Space Marines, fire explosive rounds and come in various patterns such as the standard Bolter, Bolt Pistol, and Heavy Bolter. Plasma weapons, like the Plasma Gun and Plasma Cannon, fire superheated matter capable of devastating targets, while Melta weapons, such as the Meltagun and Multi-melta, emit intense heat to vaporize armor.\n\nThe Imperial Guard relies on a mix of ballistic and laser weapons, with the Lasgun being the standard infantry rifle. They also employ a variety of grenades, including Frag, Krak, and Plasma grenades, as well as mortars and missile launchers for infantry support. Vehicle-mounted weapons range from the Battle Cannon on the Leman Russ tank to the Earthshaker Cannon on the Basilisk artillery vehicle.\n\nExotic weapons are used by specialist units and organizations within the Imperium. Assassins from the Officio Assassinorum wield unique weapons like the Exitus Rifle, Animus Speculum, and Conversion Beamer. The Adeptus Mechanicus employs advanced technologies such as the Graviton Gun and the Phosphor Serpenta.\n\nChaos Space Marines, having turned against the Imperium during the Horus Heresy, use older patterns of some weapons and have limited access to more recently developed technologies. They replace some standard Imperial wargear with daemonic alternatives, such as Daemon Armour instead of Artificer Armour. Renegade Imperial Guard units may use Autoguns in place of Lasguns due to their lack of access to Forge Worlds.",

            "content": "A Bolt Pistol is a smaller version of the Bolter, a powerful and utilitarian sidearm used by various Imperial forces such as the Space Marines, Adepta Sororitas, and some members of the Astra Militarum and Imperial Navy. It has been in service since its inception in the 30th Millennium, with the current standard Mark III pattern employed by most Loyalist Space Marine Chapters.\nBolt Pistols are favored over Laspistols due to their improved killing ability, although they are less reliable and have a smaller magazine capacity. A Bolt Pistol magazine typically holds 6 to 10 rounds of .75 caliber Bolter ammunition, weighing about 0.08 kg each. It can fire single shots or a three-round burst per trigger pull.\nWhile standard Bolters are rarely used by the Astra Militarum, Bolt Pistols are popular among Commissars and junior officers as sidearms, if they can acquire one sized for human hands. There are many patterns of Bolt Pistols used by different forces, such as the Godwyn-De'az for the Adepta Sororitas, Tigrus, Umbra, and Ultima patterns for various Space Marine Chapters, and the Sacristan pattern for Inquisitors.\nSpecialized variants include the Heavy Bolt Pistol used by Primaris Reiver and Assault Intercessor Squads, the Absolvor Bolt Pistol for Primaris Chaplains and Apothecaries, and the Executor Pistol – a combi-weapon with an underslung Needle Pistol used by Eversor Assassins. Bolt Pistols are highly sought-after weapons, often passed down as heirlooms or awarded for valor, representing status and the bearer's deadly skill.",

            "content": "Metalica, known as \"The Gleaming Giant of Ultima Segmentum,\" is an Imperial Forge World in the Charadon Sector of Segmentum Ultima. It stands as a testament to the dominance of the Cult Mechanicus in a galaxy fraught with peril. The planet's metallic surface, devoid of natural life, is dedicated solely to industry and warfare preparation. Here, amidst hissing pistons and glowing forges, the Tech-priests of Metalica tirelessly craft war machines and cybernetic soldiers known as Skitarii. These forces, distinguished by gunmetal prostheses and cyber-enhancements, are renowned for their distinctive iconography—depicting a hammer and fist in deep red, paying homage to their Martian heritage.\n\nMetalica's environment, intentionally rendered inhospitable to organic life, serves as a sacred crucible for the Cult Mechanicus' relentless pursuit of technological advancement. The world's Titan Legion, Legio Metalica, or \"Iron Skulls,\" stands as a pillar of this relentless drive. Originating from ancient times, this Titan Legion has played pivotal roles in humanity's pivotal battles, fiercely defending key Imperial worlds like Armageddon against threats ranging from Ork invasions to daemonic incursions.\n\nThroughout its history, Metalica has endured and triumphed in numerous conflicts. The First War for Armageddon witnessed Metalica's Skitarii battling alongside Imperial Knights to repel the daemon Primarch Angron and his chaotic forces. Subsequent conflicts, such as the Elucidan Schism and sieges by Nurgle's forces, further tested Metalica's resolve and innovation. Notable figures like Magos Ozmerhadus Phal embody the Forge World's zealous pursuit of perfection, even at the cost of extreme methods and contentious actions.\n\nMetalica's strategic location near the Ork Empire of Charadon has honed its forces into a formidable war machine, perpetually on guard against invasion. Despite setbacks, such as heavy losses in the Third War for Armageddon, Metalica's Legio Metalica has persevered, rebuilding its strength and reaffirming its commitment to the Omnissiah's cause.\n\nIn battle, Metalica's Skitarii wear distinct colors and markings denoting their roles and commemorating their heritage. Their weapons and machinery bear unique auditory signatures, a testament to their industrial prowess and dedication to the Omnissiah's glory. Each engagement with their foes, whether on Armageddon or in the Charadon Campaign, underscores Metalica's unyielding determination to impose order upon the galaxy through technological supremacy.",

As the head of one of the Imperium of Man's most powerful organizations, the Fabricator-General has a permanent seat among the High Lords of Terra on the Senatorum Imperialis, wielding significant influence due to the Mechanicus' control over technology and manufacturing.\n\nThe title of Fabricator-General is also granted to archmagi governing individual Forge Worlds, recognized for their superior knowledge and leadership. These leaders often hold unique titles reflecting their specific Forge World’s history and traditions within the Cult Mechanicus. \n\nThe current Fabricator-General of mars, Oud Oudia Raskian, served as one of the High Lords of Terra during the Thirteenth Black Crusade. Due to extensive cybernetic augmentation, Raskian is more building than man, making direct communication challenging. His presence in the Great Chamber of the Senatorum Imperialis requires significant logistical efforts. During the Fall of Cadia, Raskian opposed dissolving the Edict of Restraint, fearing it would expose the Mechanicus' uncertainties about their technology.\n\nRaskian collaborated with Lord Inquisitor Adamara Rassilo and other High Lords to smuggle a Dark Eldar Haemonculus onto Terra to repair the failing Golden Throne. He traveled to Commorragh to negotiate with Archon Shae-Morvain, though this plan only delayed the Throne's failure by a few centuries. After intervention by Erasmus Crowl and his retinue, Raskian fled back to Luna through a Webway Gate.\n\nRumors have since spread that Archmagos Dominus Cawl seeks to replace Raskian as Mars' Fabricator-General. However, Cawl has denied any such intentions, stating he lacks the means to do so even if he desired the position.",

Named after its sun, Sol, it is located at the astrocartographic center of the Segmentum Solar. The Sol System includes the significant planets Terra and Mars, the twin capital worlds of the Imperium, among its eight major planets and numerous dwarf planets, many of which are orbited by heavily settled moons like Luna and Titan.\n\nAs part of the Sub-sector Solar and Sector Solar, the Sol System hosts the governing bodies of the Imperium of Man, including the High Lords of Terra, the Fabricator-General of Mars, and the Emperor Himself. It is defended by Battlefleet Solar, the most formidable battlefleet of the Imperial Navy, and features some of the galaxy's most formidable fortifications, manned by warriors and shielded by advanced technology and faith. The Adeptus Custodes play a critical role in the system's defense, ensuring its security against potential invaders who would be challenged even before reaching the Mandeville Point.\n\nThe Sol System's outer boundaries are fortified with massive star forts and void mines, patrolled by system monitors and hunter-Servitors. As invaders push deeper into the system, they would face increasing resistance from Battlefleet Solar's heavy naval patrols and numerous defensive installations. Notably, the system houses key forces such as the Grey Knights, the Inquisition, and the Adeptus Mechanicus, each contributing to the defense through their formidable presence and resources. Terra and its sister worlds can now muster greater defensive forces than ever before, bolstered by the Solar Watch and the Imperial Fists' mobile battle station, Phalanx.\n\nThe Sol System also experiences an immense flow of pilgrims, merchants, and other travelers arriving daily through strictly coordinated approach corridors. Every planet and moon within the system, with few exceptions, is ringed with habitats and docking platforms, hosting sprawling hab complexes, manufactoria, and city-sized fortifications. Amidst this constant influx of humanity, rebellion, sedition, and heresy can easily arise, necessitating vigilant oversight by the Inquisition and the Adeptus Custodes.\n\nThe Inquisition works tirelessly to root out threats within the Sol System, but even its agents are susceptible to corruption. Therefore, the Adeptus Custodes maintain their own patrols and monitoring sweeps, supervising the vetting of countless Imperial citizens passing through Terra's spaceports. They conduct surprise inspections of the system's defenses and deploy spy-servitors and surveillance devices to gather intelligence, helping the Captain-General make informed command decisions.\n\nThe Sol System's notable planets include Mercury, Venus, Terra, Luna, Mars, and several others, each playing a distinct role in the Imperium's structure. Mercury serves as a mining world, Venus hosts luxury resorts, Terra is the sacred Throneworld, Luna is a civilised world famous for its gene-laboratories, and Mars is the Imperium's greatest Forge World. The system's extensive defense network, combined with its socio-political and economic significance, makes it a linchpin of the Imperium's power in the galaxy.",

This representation isn't just a static model; it mysteriously influences the actual galaxy, allowing alterations within the Orrery to manifest physically across corresponding regions of space.\n\nCrafted by the Oruscar Dynasty artisans before the War in Heaven, the Orrery is not merely a marvel of artistry but a tool of immense strategic importance. Its ability to predict and potentially manipulate future events makes it a coveted asset.\n\nDuring the 13th Black Crusade in 999.M41, Necron Overlord Trazyn the Infinite sought the Orrery's aid after his home world's defenses were compromised. Despite tensions with the Oruscar Dynasty, he gained access to the Orrery, discovering an unsettling crimson corruption spreading through the galaxy, unnoticed by its custodians.\n\nRealizing the Oruscar's centuries-long inaction against this corruption, Trazyn contemplated intervening himself, driven by his own motives and amusement. Using the Orrery, he identified Cadia as a focal point in the galaxy's turmoil, home to ancient Necron Pylons crucial for containing the Immaterium.\n\nDuring the final battle for Cadia, Trazyn intervened, aiding Imperial forces and ultimately acquiring Ursarkar E. Creed for his collection before Cadia fell to chaos. His actions showcased the Orrery's dual role as both a strategic tool and a source of historical insight, highlighting its profound influence on galactic events.\n\nDespite the Orrery's immense power, the Oruscar Dynasty exercises caution, viewing themselves as stewards rather than conquerors. Their careful management aims to preserve cosmic balance, contrasting sharply with Trazyn's more whimsical and opportunistic approach.\n\nThe Orrery's complex mechanisms and the conflicts surrounding its use underscore its pivotal role in the Warhammer 40,000 universe, where its manipulation can reshape the fate of entire star systems and civilizations, driving the ongoing struggle for control among Necrons, aliens, and Imperium alike.",

            "content": "The Lex Imperialis, also known as Imperial Law, stands as the enduring legal framework of the Imperium of Man, spanning millennia of evolution and governance. Initially shaped by the decrees of the Emperor during the Great Crusade and refined through subsequent amendments by figures like Roboute Guilliman, it governs all aspects of life within the Imperium, blending civil and criminal statutes into a cohesive whole.\n\nEnforced primarily by the Adeptus Arbites and the Inquisition, Imperial Law serves as a divine mandate, reflecting the Emperor's will and demanding unwavering obedience. The Adeptus Arbites function as the enforcers of these laws, operating as a galaxy-spanning police force from fortified Precinct Fortresses. Their authority is bolstered by the Book of Judgement, a vast repository of legal precedents housed on Terra, which guides Arbites Judges in dispensing justice across Human-settled worlds.\n\nBeyond the Arbites, the Inquisition plays a crucial role in upholding Imperial Law, operating independently to root out threats to Imperial stability. Divided into Puritan and Radical factions, the Inquisition interprets and enforces the laws with varying degrees of strictness, reflecting internal ideological tensions. Puritans uphold the letter of Imperial Law and traditional beliefs without compromise, while Radicals adopt more flexible interpretations and methods, risking accusations of heresy in pursuit of their goals.\n\nImperial Law embodies a blend of secular governance and religious doctrine, viewed not just as legal statutes but as expressions of divine will. It mandates centralized authority under the High Lords of Terra, ensuring uniformity of law while allowing for adaptations to local conditions overseen by planetary governors. Enforcement by the Adeptus Arbites is marked by stringent measures to maintain order, with punishments ranging from fines to execution, particularly severe when crimes threaten Imperial stability or challenge the spiritual order.\n\nCrucially, Imperial Law addresses crimes such as heresy and sedition, seen as existential threats to the Imperium. Heresy involves deviating from the Ecclesiarchy's doctrines, while sedition targets actions aimed at undermining Imperial authority. Both are swiftly and decisively handled by the Arbites and Inquisition, underscoring the Imperium's uncompromising stance on internal threats.\n\nWhile Imperial Law maintains a rigid framework, it allows for interpretative flexibility, particularly within the Inquisition. Radicals may justify unorthodox methods in pursuit of broader objectives, albeit under strict scrutiny to prevent deviation into heresy. This balance between rigidity and flexibility ensures the Imperium's stability while addressing diverse challenges across its vast territories.",

            "content": "T'au, the homeworld of the T'au species located in the T'au star system, stands as the paramount Sept within the T'au Empire. Governed by the High Council under the leadership of Ethereal Supreme Aun'Va, T'au holds unrivaled political significance. Even as the T'au Empire expanded across the stars, T'au retained its cultural centrality and bureaucratic core. Its warm, arid climate influences T'au's colonization strategy, steering T'au settlers towards planets like T'ros with similar environmental conditions.\n\nHistorically, T'au was discovered millennia ago by the Adeptus Mechanicus' vessel, Land's Vision, long before the T'au attained spacefaring capabilities. The planet narrowly avoided Imperial conquest when a Warp Storm isolated it from the broader galaxy. During this isolation, the T'au rapidly advanced culturally and technologically, emerging as a sophisticated starfaring civilization after the Warp Storm dissipated in the 39th Millennium. The T'au Sept, originating from these early explorers, serves as a template for subsequent T'au colonies, influencing their military and administrative structures.\n\nThe warriors of T'au Sept are renowned for their strategic prowess, focusing on eliminating single targets with efficiency. They adhere strictly to their established combat doctrines, which have been adopted across T'au colonies. The cultural and military influence of T'au Sept resonates throughout the T'au Empire, embodying the disciplined and forward-thinking ethos that defines the T'au's approach to expansion and governance.\n\nThe Adeptus Arbites, in contrast, uphold the extensive and intricate Imperial Law of the Imperium of Man. Located on Terra, the Hall of Judgement houses millennia of legal precedent and rulings, guiding Arbites in their enforcement duties across human-settled worlds. The Imperium's legal system, rooted in religious reverence for the God-Emperor, mandates obedience and service from all humanity, with crimes against this divine order seen as blasphemous. The Arbites' role extends to quelling planetary unrest and sedition, ensuring Imperial stability through rigorous enforcement and judicial process.\n\nThe Inquisition, operating outside standard Imperial hierarchy, combats threats ranging from Chaos corruption to alien incursions. Divided between Puritan and Radical factions, Inquisitors interpret and enforce Imperial law with varying degrees of adherence to tradition or innovation. This complexity underscores the Imperium's authoritarian governance, where legal interpretation and enforcement are pivotal to maintaining order amidst myriad threats to human dominance in the galaxy.",

These colossal war machines are revered as walking fortresses, housing an array of armaments that eclipse those of smaller Titans like the Warmaster-class. Known for their role as Emperor-grade Titans, they are rarely seen on the battlefield due to the Adeptus Mechanicus' lost ability to produce them.\n\nIn contrast to their more specialized counterpart, the Warmonger-class, Imperator Titans serve as versatile assault platforms. Their design features a massive upper structure resembling a fortified cathedral, an iconic symbol of both awe-inspiring power and devotion to the Machine God. Despite their immense bulk which limits speed and agility, Imperator Titans compensate with an arsenal that includes arm-mounted primary weapons like Hellstorm Cannons and Plasma Annihilators, supported by an extensive array of secondary weapons and formidable Void Shields.\n\nEmperor-grade Titans are not merely machines of war; they are considered avatars of the Machine God himself, embodying divine wrath against enemies of the Omnissiah. This symbolic significance is reflected in their ornate architecture and the religious reverence with which they are maintained by their crews. Deployed strategically as mobile fortresses or spearheading major offensives, Imperator Titans remain unrivaled in their capacity to unleash devastating barrages from a safe distance, making them critical assets in the Imperium's most crucial battles.\n\nIn conclusion, Imperator-class Titans epitomize the Imperium's technological might and religious zeal. Rare and revered, these god-engines stand as both symbols of awe and instruments of annihilation, ensuring that wherever they tread, the enemies of humanity face the inexorable wrath of the Machine God incarnate.",

Originally referring to many types of large combat walkers used by different factions, the term \"Titan\" now only applies to Imperial and Chaos Titans, with the war engines of xenos races having their own designations. Titans are the most sacred and powerful ground units of the Imperium, with the ability to crush armies and devastate the battlefield. They range in size from around 15 meters tall for Scout Titans up to 150 meters tall for the immense Emperor Titans.\nTitans are divided into different classes based on size and combat role. The smaller Scout Titans like Warhounds are fast and agile, used for reconaissance and infantry support. Battle Titans like Reavers and Warlords form the backbone of Titan Legions with a mix of firepower and durability. The gigantic Emperor Titans are the kings of the battlefield, with whole castles and cathedrals on their enormous frames, though they are very rare. Each Titan is given a unique High Gothic name and losing one is considered a tragic event mourned by its Forge World.\nThe weaponry carried by Titans is specialized for different combat roles, from targeting elite enemies and fortifications to wiping out legions of troops or providing devastating artillery support. Scout Titans wield relatively short-ranged weapons designed to destroy light vehicles and infantry swarms. Battle Titans and Emperor Titans mount much longer-ranged and more powerful weapons that can annihilate enemy Titans, superheavy tanks, and fortresses. Titans are also shielded by nigh-impenetrable armour and powerful void shields that can absorb massive amounts of destructive energy before failing. The presence of even a single Titan can turn the tide of a battle, and nothing inspires more awe and terror than the sight of these behemoths unleashing their apocalyptic fury.",

These towering god-engines played a pivotal role during the Great Crusade, carrying the light of Unification to countless worlds alongside the Space Marine Legions. The Titan Legions were organized into distinct Orders, each with its own unique culture and traditions, and collectively formed a politically influential entity within the nascent Imperium.\nDuring the cataclysmic events of the Horus Heresy, the Titan Legions found themselves on opposing sides of the conflict. Many declared their allegiance to the Warmaster Horus, turning against their former allies and unleashing unimaginable destruction upon the Imperium. Bitter rivalries between certain Titan Legions were aggravated into outright hatred, leading to devastating clashes on numerous worlds such as Calth, Tallarn, and Beta-Garmon. The Siege of Terra saw the Traitor Titans of the Legio Mortis finally breach the walls of the Imperial Palace, though Horus' ultimate defeat forced them to flee into the Eye of Terror.\nIn the millennia following the Heresy, the Collegia Titanica continued to serve the Imperium, bringing its immense firepower to bear against various threats. The Loyalist Titan Orders, united under the reformed Adeptus Titanicus, remained vigilant, guarding the Imperium from Chaos incursions and xenos threats. They participated in major conflicts such as the Siege of Vraks, the Badab War, and the Third War for Armageddon, often playing decisive roles in these campaigns.\nAs the 41st Millennium drew to a close, the Collegia Titanica faced one of its greatest challenges during the 13th Black Crusade. The Titan Legions stationed near the Eye of Terror were called upon to defend the Fortress World of Cadia against the forces of Chaos, with many Legions committing their entire strength to this critical battle. The outcome of this monumental clash would determine the fate of the Imperium and the galaxy as a whole.",

The Tyranids travel across the vast emptiness of space in gigantic, living starships known as Hive Ships, each home to countless lesser Tyranid organisms. They are drawn to the galaxy by the psychic beacon of the Astronomican, and their numberless swarms have already consumed countless worlds.\nAll Tyranids are connected by a psychic hive mind that allows them to communicate and coordinate instantly on a staggering scale. The largest Tyranid bioforms, called Synapse Creatures, serve as focal points for this Hive Mind, and through them, the swarm is controlled. The coming of a Tyranid Hive Fleet is preceded by a smothering psychic signal that envelops entire star systems and disrupts all forms of Warp travel and communication. This is known as the \"Shadow in the Warp,\" and it heralds imminent invasion and horror.\nTyranid combat doctrine is based on overwhelming the enemy with sheer numbers and winning victories through attrition. Their armies are vast hordes of specialized organisms, each bioform playing a unique role in battle. Tyranid weapons and technology are entirely biological, living organisms that are lethal extensions of the creatures that wield them. On the battlefield, the Tyranids adapt quickly to enemy tactics, evolving new bioforms to overcome any resistance.\nA Tyranid planetary invasion progresses through distinct stages, beginning with subtle infiltration by advanced organisms and culminating in total consumption of the planet's biomass. Vanguard drone ships and independent creatures like Genestealers and Lictors first scout out a target planet and gradually infest it. When a foothold has been established, a Hive Fleet arrives in-system and rains devastation upon the planet, initiating a two-pronged assault. On the ground, endless swarms of Tyranid warriors sweep across continents, leaving a carpet of dead in their wake. In the skies, winged creatures swarm in numbers large enough to blot out the sun. Capillary Towers burst from the planet's crust, siphoning biological matter to feed the swarm.

            "content": "The Hive Mind represents the collective consciousness of the Tyranid species, a nearly omniscient psychic entity originating from outside the Milky Way Galaxy. It exerts total control over every Tyranid creature, directing their actions through a powerful mental grip. Central to this control are synapse creatures, like the Hive Tyrant, which act as conduits for the Hive Mind’s psychic commands. When these synapse creatures are killed, the control is disrupted, leaving lesser Tyranid bioforms to revert to basic animal instincts. On the battlefield, larger and more autonomous Tyranids, such as Hive Tyrants and Tyranid Warriors, telepathically channel the Hive Mind's influence to manage smaller bioforms, ensuring they act cohesively rather than succumbing to instinctive behaviors.\n\nThe complexity and power of the Hive Mind's psychic gestalt are such that it can drive most psykers insane or even kill them. Chief Librarian Tigurius of the Ultramarines is the only known Imperial agent to have interacted with the Hive Mind and retained his sanity, likely due to his exceptional predictive talents. His ability to understand the Hive Mind's intentions suggests a rare and profound connection, a feat otherwise considered achievable only by psykers of immense power, comparable to the Emperor of Mankind. This intense psychic presence also enables the Hive Mind to disrupt interstellar communications and Warp travel, a phenomenon known as the \"Shadow in the Warp.\" This ability allows the Hive Mind to isolate targeted galaxies, preventing reinforcements and trapping inhabitants in a psychic shroud.\n\nThe Shadow in the Warp creates an atmosphere of terror and confusion on prey worlds, preventing calls for assistance and causing widespread despair. This psychic shroud penetrates the minds of nearby creatures, manifesting as a profound malaise, especially magnified in those with psychic potential, potentially leading to incurable psychosis. As a Hive Fleet approaches a target, entire populations often descend into madness even before any Tyranids land. This invasive psychic influence ensures the Hive Mind’s dominance, spreading fear and chaos that weaken resistance long before physical combat begins.",

These cults are created and controlled by the Genestealer, a Tyranid organism capable of infecting hosts with its genetic material to create hybrids. The original Genestealer Patriarch begins the infection cycle, and as the cult grows, it psychically controls the brood. The infected hosts, or Contagii, return to their societies, compelled to reproduce and spread the Genestealer's DNA. Though Contagii mostly resemble their original species, they are mental slaves to the Patriarch's will.\nAs the infection spreads, the Genestealer hybrids become increasingly Human-like with each generation. The first generation hybrids are monstrous and alien, while the second generation is more sapient but still noticeably inhuman. By the third generation, the hybrids can pass for Human mutants, hiding their true nature from society. The fourth generation hybrids, or Primacii, are nearly indistinguishable from Humans and infiltrate positions of authority to advance the cult's agenda. Some of these fourth generation hybrids develop psychic powers, becoming the Magus or Primus of the cult.\nThe Genestealer Cult grows in secret, spreading throughout the host society and even to other worlds as subsequent generations breed and infect new victims. All the while, they are united and controlled by the Patriarch's Broodmind, a psychic gestalt consciousness. The hybrids are fiercely loyal to their cult and Patriarch, prioritizing the survival and propagation of their brood above all else.\nOnce the cult has grown strong enough, it will rise up in a violent insurrection, seeking to overthrow the rule of the Imperium on their host planet in the name of their Patriarch and vile Tyranid gods. They utilize a combination of subterfuge, underground organization, infiltration, and the psychic might of their leaders to prepare for this uprising. When the time is right, the cult will burst forth in a tide of violence, armed with stolen weapons and equipment, as well as their own twisted bioforms and hybrid monstrosities. If the cult successfully conquers the planet, it will ultimately be consumed by the Tyranid Hive Fleet drawn to the psychic signal of the Broodmind, but until that day, the cult fights with unbreakable devotion to its abhorrent masters.",

            "content": "The High Lords of Terra, collectively known as the High Twelve or the Senatorum Imperialis, form the highest governing body of the Imperium of Man. Tasked with interpreting the divine will of the Emperor of Mankind, they wield immense political power over the galaxy-spanning empire. Originally established during the Age of the Imperium, their authority evolved from the Emperor's decision to decentralize direct governance, entrusting mortal leaders with managing the Imperium's vast bureaucracy and administration.\n\nThroughout history, the High Lords have been pivotal in guiding the Imperium's policies and decisions, impacting the lives of trillions across countless worlds. Their role as interpreters of the Emperor's will became especially crucial after the Emperor's internment upon the Golden Throne following the Horus Heresy. During this dark period, figures like Malcador the Sigillite and later Roboute Guilliman played instrumental roles in shaping the Senatorum Imperialis into its current form. Guilliman, upon his return during the Ultramar Campaign, undertook significant reforms, reconstituting the Senatorum Imperialis to better suit the Imperium's needs in the turbulent Era Indomitus.\n\nThe composition of the High Lords typically includes leaders from the most powerful adepta and institutions of the Imperium, such as the Adeptus Administratum, Adeptus Mechanicus, and the Inquisition. Each member represents not only their respective organization but also embodies centuries of tradition, alliances, and occasional power struggles. Over the millennia, the structure of the Senatorum Imperialis has seen changes, from adding seats for influential figures like the Ecclesiarch to weathering crises such as the Reign of Blood during the Age of Apostasy.\n\nRoboute Guilliman's return marked a notable shift as he assumed the role of lord commander and Imperial Regent, consolidating executive authority in a single figure, albeit with the support and counsel of the High Lords. This centralization aimed to streamline decision-making in the face of galactic threats like the Great Rift and the Noctis Aeterna. Despite this, political tensions persist, as seen in disputes over territorial claims and autonomy rights, particularly concerning the Adeptus Mechanicus.\n\nThus, while the High Lords of Terra continue to interpret the Emperor's will and govern the Imperium with vast authority, their history reflects a complex interplay of institutional power, religious influence, and strategic leadership in an empire constantly besieged by external and internal threats.",

They were the undisputed masters of the stars, counting themselves as the most powerful race and pursuing their whims and desires without restraint. However, their overweening pride and fall into decadence ultimately led to a cataclysm of their own making. The psychic backlash of their hedonistic excesses coalesced in the Warp, birthing the Chaos God Slaanesh. The Fall of the Aeldari shattered their civilization, and the newborn deity consumed the souls of billions as it took its first breath. To escape this fate, the surviving Aeldari factions each pursued different paths to survival.\nThe Asuryani, or Craftworld Aeldari, fled on gigantic starships, adopting strict codes of behavior to keep their darker impulses in check. They rely on advanced psychocrystalline technology called Spirit Stones and Infinity Circuits to safeguard their souls after death. The Drukhari, also known as the Dark Eldar, retreated deep into the labyrinthine confines of the Webway, particularly the Dark City of Commorragh. They stave off Slaanesh's hunger by indulging in piracy, torture, and the suffering of others. The Exodites, who foresaw the coming fall, rejected the decadence of their kin and settled on remote worlds, living simpler, hardier lives more attuned to nature. The Harlequins, devotees of the Laughing God Cegorach, travel between the Aeldari factions as performers and storytellers, preserving their mythic history and culture.\nIn the 41st Millennium, the Aeldari find themselves beset by threats from all sides. The Imperium of Man has risen to preeminence in the galaxy, and its teeming armies often come into conflict with the dwindling Aeldari. The brutish Orks, given strength by the constant conflict, threaten to overrun the galaxy if left unchecked. The Tyranids from beyond the galactic rim devour all in their path, seeing the Aeldari worlds as a bounty of biomass. The Necrons, ancient foes of the Aeldari from before the Fall, arise from their hibernation to renew their war against all life. Worst of all, the coming of the Great Rift has spilled the forces of Chaos into realspace like never before, drowning the galaxy in conflict and corruption.\nAmidst this age of unending war, a new Aeldari god has awakened. Ynnead, the Whispering God, offers salvation to all Aeldari, and a final end to the soul-hunger of Slaanesh. The Ynnari, followers of Ynnead's prophet Yvraine, seek to unite the fractured Aeldari factions and resurrect their race to its former glory. But the path ahead is dark and dangerous, and the future of the Aeldari remains uncertain in this era of woe and strife.",

It is infamous for its proximity to the Eye of Terror, a colossal Warp rift and permanent Warp storm that serves as the primary stronghold for the chaotic forces of the galaxy. This region of the Imperium of Man has historically borne the brunt of assaults launched by Abaddon the Despoiler during his Black Crusades, particularly the 13th in 999.M41, which pushed Imperial forces to unprecedented levels of mobilization reminiscent of the Horus Heresy.\n\nFollowing the cataclysmic events of the Great Rift's formation during the Era Indomitus, much of the Segmentum Obscurus now resides within the Imperium Nihilus, where the guiding light of the Astronomican struggles to penetrate. This has plunged the region into darkness and isolation, complicating communications and travel across its sectors and systems.\n\nKey sectors within the Segmentum Obscurus include notable regions like Agripinaa, known for its industrial might and critical role in supplying military resources to Cadia; the Gothic Sector, which witnessed the infamous Gothic War and subsequent Chaos incursions; and the Calixis Sector, a hub of political intrigue and site of the Dark Heresy role-playing game, situated near the treacherous Halo Stars.\n\nAt the heart of the Segmentum Obscurus lies Cypra Mundi, where the Imperial Navy's Segmentum fleet headquarters commands operations and coordinates defenses against Chaos incursions. This system also serves as the central hub for Segmentum Command, overseeing military strategy and response across the Imperium's northern territories.\n\nDespite its strategic importance and the valor of its defenders, the Segmentum Obscurus remains a region fraught with peril and beset by constant threats from the Eye of Terror and other chaotic influences. Its worlds, from heavily fortified bastions like Cadia to industrial powerhouses like Agripinaa, stand as bulwarks against the encroaching darkness that threatens to engulf the Imperium's northern frontiers.",

            "content": "Exterminatus is the ultimate sanction wielded by the Imperium of Man, executed only in dire circumstances where a planet poses an existential threat to humanity across the galaxy. Initiated by the highest echelons of Imperial command—the Astra Militarum, Navis Imperialis, Adeptus Astartes, or the Imperial Inquisition—Exterminatus aims to eradicate all life and render a world uninhabitable. It is a measure of last resort, enacted when the cost of holding or reclaiming a planet for the Emperor exceeds acceptable limits, or when the risk of chaos, mutation, or heresy spreading beyond containment becomes intolerable.\n\nThe methods employed in Exterminatus are devastating and varied. Orbital bombardment, the simplest and most direct approach, utilizes the overwhelming firepower of Imperial warships to rain down destruction ranging from precision strikes to cataclysmic thermonuclear blasts. Virus bombs, engineered to unleash the Life-Eater Virus, swiftly reduce planetary life to a bio-chemical sludge, often igniting the atmosphere into a planet-wide firestorm to ensure complete eradication. Cyclonic torpedoes, another grim tool, induce thermonuclear reactions or plasma bombardments that obliterate a planet's biosphere, leaving behind a lifeless husk.\n\nThese actions are not taken lightly; the decision to enact Exterminatus undergoes rigorous scrutiny within the Imperium. Inquisitors wield the authority to order Exterminatus autonomously, while Chapter Masters of the Adeptus Astartes may also authorize such drastic measures when deemed necessary. The repercussions of these decisions are profound, with the potential loss of billions of lives weighed against the preservation of the Imperium itself. Instances of Exterminatus on strategically vital worlds are exceedingly rare, highlighting its role as a measure reserved for the gravest threats to human survival.\n\nRare variants of Exterminatus, like two-stage cyclonic torpedoes used against biologically void or Necron-infested worlds, further underscore the diversity and severity of these methods. Each instance marks a grim testament to the Imperium's unyielding resolve and readiness to make sacrificial decisions in the name of humanity's survival. Though controversial and morally fraught, Exterminatus remains a chilling reminder of the Imperium's uncompromising stance against threats that could jeopardize its vast dominion spanning the galaxy.",

The headquarters of the Imperial Navy fleet in this segmentum is on Hydraphur, which also serves as the segmentum fortress.\n\nThe segmentum gained fame through Lord Commander Solar Macharius's campaign, where he conquered a thousand worlds. It was also a hub during the Plague of Unbelief in the 36th Millennium, when Apostate Cardinal Bucharis attempted to create his own empire. In the 41st Millennium, the Sabbat Worlds Crusade occurred here, aiming to reclaim the sector from Chaos forces.\n\nThe Veiled Region lies to the galactic south of the Segmentum Pacificus. This unmapped frontier is characterized by dense nebulae, newborn stars, and intense stellar radiation. It houses Ork corsairs, xenos mercenaries, a primitive alien race, and the feared Necrons. The Soul Drinkers, a Renegade Space Marine Chapter, once sought refuge here.\n\nThe Laanah Rifts, located in the northwestern Segmentum Pacificus, were dominated by aliens and heretics until the Belrath Crusade in 182.M38 brought much of the area under Imperial control, leading to the creation of the Laanah Sector.\n\nNotable sectors include the Chiros Sector, a turbulent frontier plagued by xenos incursions and Chaos rebellions, and the Sabbat Worlds Sector, a group of over 100 star systems along the rimward edge of the Segmentum. This region, named after Saint Sabbat who led its initial Imperial colonization, faced severe Chaos invasions in the 41st Millennium. The Imperium's forces are engaged in an ongoing crusade to reclaim it.\n\nNotable worlds in the Segmentum Pacificus include Constantinium, known for its rebellions; Hydraphur, the Imperial Navy Battlefleet Pacificus headquarters; Macharia, the shrine world of Saint Macharius; Oghram, an early victim of the Tyranid Hive Fleet Leviathan; Tanith, home of the Tanith First and Only regiment, destroyed by Chaos; and Verghast, where Vervunhive fell to Chaos during the Sabbat Worlds Crusade.\n\nThe Halo Zone, at the galaxy's edge, contains ancient stars and remains largely unexplored due to its distance from the Astronomican, making navigation extremely hazardous. This region's mystery and danger have discouraged many from venturing into its depths.",

To capitalise on the Necrons' and their C'tan masters' vulnerability to Warp-based attacks during the War in Heaven, the fortresses were equipped with a Warp Cannon that could create a devastating rip in the fabric of realspace that would unleash an eruption of psychic energy from the Immaterium powerful enough to destroy entire star systems. This power can be linked with that of the other fortresses to create an even more powerful beam, as became clear when Abaddon the Despoiler used two of the fortresses to destroy the planet Fularis II, and three to cause the Tarantis star to go supernova during the Gothic War.",

He commands the Black Legion of Chaos Space Marines, speculated to be a genetic descendant of the infamous Warmaster Horus, once his favored son and first captain of the Sons of Horus Legion.\n\nAbaddon's notoriety stems from his leadership in the Black Crusades, massive Chaos offensives from the Eye of Terror against the Imperium. These campaigns form part of his strategic \"Crimson Path,\" aimed at reaching Terra itself, culminating in the Great Rift's creation during the 13th Black Crusade. This catastrophic event divided the galaxy and ushered in the Noctis Aeterna and Era Indomitus.\n\nInitially rising to prominence as Horus's first captain during the Great Crusade, Abaddon's loyalty shifted with Horus's rebellion against the Emperor during the Horus Heresy. After Horus's death, Abaddon inherited his mantle, leading the renamed Sons of Horus Legion across pivotal battles like Isstvan III, Isstvan V, and Terra. His grief and anger at Horus's demise fueled a relentless pursuit of vengeance against the Imperium.\n\nFollowing the Heresy, Abaddon transformed the Sons of Horus into the fearsome Black Legion and initiated the infamous 1st Black Crusade. He forged dark alliances with the Chaos Gods, notably recovering the Daemon Sword Drach'nyen, enhancing his unstoppable reputation. Subsequent Black Crusades, now totaling twelve, furthered his enigmatic goals, consolidating his power and unraveling the Imperium's defenses.\n\nAbaddon's enduring ambition is to succeed where Horus failed: breaching the Imperial Palace, dethroning the Emperor from the Golden Throne, and reshaping the galaxy in Chaos's image. His influence spans millennia, gradually eroding the barriers between realspace and the Warp, leaving an indelible mark on galactic history.\n\nIn the Imperium, Abaddon's name evokes dread and serves as a reminder of Chaos's relentless threat. His determination to unite the Traitor Legions and fulfill ancient prophecies continues to drive him, promising a future where the Ruinous Powers reign supreme.\n\nDespite facing numerous setbacks and betrayals, Abaddon remains resolute, driven by an unquenchable thirst for vengeance and dominion. His legacy as the Warmaster of Chaos is intertwined with the galaxy's darkest epochs, shaping its fate in ways few can comprehend or oppose.",

            "content": "Chaos Titans are monstrous war machines transformed by the corrupting influence of Chaos, merging machine and daemon into horrifying amalgamations. Unlike their Imperial counterparts, the crews of these Titans often fuse with their machines, becoming indistinguishable from them. During the Horus Heresy, many Titan Legions turned to Chaos, forming the Dark Mechanicum. Over millennia, more Legions succumbed to corruption, aligning themselves with one of the four Ruinous Powers of Chaos. Slaanesh Chaos Titans, for instance, utilize their incredible speed and the Glamour of Slaanesh, a shimmering aura that confounds enemy targeting systems. These Titans are animated by bound daemons and employ devastating weaponry like Psi-Pulse generators and Tormentor Cannons to crush their foes.\n\nThe corruption and transformation of these Titans vary based on their alignment with specific Chaos Gods. For example, the Banelord-class Titan, dedicated to Khorne, features brutal modifications such as a tail cannon and specialized weapons like the Havoc Missile Rack. Other classes like the Plaguelord, Painlord, and Warplord Titans are dedicated to Nurgle, Slaanesh, and Tzeentch respectively, each reflecting their patron god's unique traits. The Feral-class Titans, once Imperial Warhound-class Titans, have been reclassified due to their deep corruption and millennia of service to Chaos. These Titans' machine spirits and crews are fully possessed, serving the will of Chaos eternally. The Ravager-class Titans, once Reaver-class Titans, have undergone similar transformations, becoming relics of terror from the Horus Heresy, now dedicated to perpetual warfare under Chaos.\n\nAmong the mightiest of these corrupted war machines are the Chaos Emperor Titans, such as the infamous Imperator-class Dies Irae and Abominatus, fused with Greater Daemons to become nearly unstoppable. These Titans are rarely deployed, reserved for the most crucial battles where Chaos is willing to pay any price for victory. Their transformation into Chaos Titans involves intricate and malevolent rituals, binding daemons to their forms and imbuing them with malevolent power. Such Titans stand as towering embodiments of the Chaos Gods' might, revered by lesser beings and feared by their enemies. With their horrific capabilities and daemonic enhancements, Chaos Titans are unparalleled instruments of destruction in the service of the Ruinous Powers.",

            "content": "The Death Korps of Krieg is the name given to all of the Astra Militarum regiments that originate from the devastated, post-nuclear Death World of Krieg in the Segmentum Tempestus.\n\nKrieg was the site of a rebellion against the Imperium of Man over 1,500 standard years ago in the 40th Millennium and was bombarded with nuclear weapons followed by five hundred Terran years of grinding warfare to purge the heretical rebels.\n\nAfter all those years of nuclear destruction and bitter trench warfare, Krieg was reduced to a scorched, radioactive husk of a world composed of dust and mud whose surviving people were forced to retreat into underground hive cities to survive the toxic planetary environment.\n\nThe Death Korps of Krieg is a siege specialist Militarum Regimento of the Astra Militarum and the regiments raised on Krieg seek to repent for their former treachery against the Emperor by displaying a disturbing disregard for their own lives in combat. Death Korps troops excel at wars of attrition and defensive combat in particular.\n\nIn 433.M40, the once-loyal Imperial world of Krieg declared independence and renounced the glory of the God-Emperor. At that moment, the world was changed forever. Colonel Jurten, commander of the 83rd Krieg Regiment of the Astra Militarum, gathered to him all those still loyal to the Imperium, and struck back against the rebellion, choosing to unleash the horror of atomic bombardment upon those who had forsaken the Emperor.\n\nAfter five hundred standard years of atomic fire, continent-spanning trench warfare, and thunderous artillery barrages, the attempted secession of Krieg was halted, but at great cost: Krieg had become a blasted, irradiated wasteland, barely inhabitable by Humans. The remaining population was forced to exist in the subterranean bunkers and tunnels that had spread across the planet during the war, and found that they could not walk upon the surface without protective equipment.\n\nSeeking to atone for the betrayal their world's government had committed, and with no other resources left to offer up in the Imperial Tithe, the people of Krieg set about providing the only thing they had left -- manpower. Hardened by generations of war in an atomic wasteland, the Krieg people were already well-prepared to be sent out into the galaxy as Imperial Guardsmen.\n\nTrained amongst the irradiated ruins of long-dead cities, equipped for the most hostile environments, and raised on sermons of self-sacrifice and penitence, the Krieg regiments have commonly been deployed -- often at their own request -- to some of the deadliest warzones, from the toxic ash wastes that surround many hive cities, to brutal wars of attrition and years-long sieges",

They worship Chaos and seek forbidden knowledge.\n\nAfter the Horus Heresy, the Dark Mechanicum fled to the Eye of Terror and other remote corners of the galaxy.

Many Forge Worlds joined their cause, drawn by promises of autonomy and freedom from Imperial restrictions on research and AI.\n\nIn the current era, the Dark Mechanicum resides within the Eye of Terror, servicing Chaos forces with their extensive knowledge of forbidden technologies. They revere Chaos Gods as patrons, contrasting sharply with their Adeptus Mechanicus counterparts who follow the Omnissiah.\n\nBeyond the Eye of Terror, some Dark Mechanicum factions inhabit regions like the Calixis Sector, evading Imperial pursuit while practicing their dark arts.

Though debated by historians, it was generally believed that Coruscant was the original homeworld of humanity. Coruscant was at one point also historically the home of the ancient Taung and Zhell. Noted for its cosmopolitan culture and towering skyscrapers, Coruscant's population consisted of trillions of citizens hailing from a vast array of both humanoid and alien species. In addition, Coruscant's strategic location at the end of several major trade routes enabled it to grow in power and influence, causing the city-planet to surpass its early rivals and become the hub of galactic culture, education, finance, fine arts, politics and technology. It was the location of several major landmarks, including the Jedi Temple, Monument Plaza, and the Senate Building. \nFor more information: https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Coruscant",

The cylindrical central hub had eight equidistant protrusions, which included docking areas for starships such as Venator-class Star Destroyers and Pelta-class frigates.

The temperature, although always frigid, was known to drop to -60°C come nightfall. Although devoid of intelligent life, Hoth was home to fifteen subspecies of tauntauns, which were commonly used by Rebels as a means of transport, and which Han Solo cut open to use as shelter to keep Luke Skywalker and himself warm during a snowstorm. It was also home to a species of towering predators known as wampas. During his stay on Hoth, Skywalker was captured by a wampa and was hung upside down in the wampa's cave, waiting to be eaten. Using the power of the Force, Skywalker managed to get his hands on his lightsaber and cut himself down from the roof and sever the wampa's right arm. The planet also had a number of \"crystalline geysers.\"\n\nFor more information: https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Hoth",

Because of its ties with the Alliance, the planet was destroyed when Grand Moff Wilhuff Tarkin decided to test the superlaser of the Death Star, a moon-sized battle station developed by the Empire, at full strength.

It was a mist-covered swamp world with a hot, humid and fetid climate maintained by thick swampy rain that fell almost perpetually. The world was a hotbed of life and its environment was fairly representative of the sentient Hutt species that inhabited the world.[14] The influence of the Hutts made the world an important location. The planet's surface was covered with numerous bogs with what little solid land there was claimed by the Hutts and used to support their homes.\n\nThe Hutts built only a handful of spaceports on the surface of Nal Hutta in order to connect their towns, settlements, and palaces, as the planet received few visitors due to most business with offworlders being conducted on the planet's largest moon, Nar Shaddaa. The foremost of these spaceports was the planet's capital city, Bilbousa, a sprawling mess covered in arching roots that spread out from looming bulbous pods. Within sight of the city was the Palace of Gardulla Besadii the Elder, one of the largest buildings on Nal Hutta, which served as the occasional headquarters of the Grand Hutt Council, the ruling body that both worked and led the Hutt Clan. Under the Hutt's control, the planet shared a reputation with Nar Shaddaa for being polluted and dangerous, but played a leading role in the galaxy's shadow economy.\n\nFor more information: https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Nal_Hutta",

            "content": "Tatooine was a sparsely inhabited circumbinary desert planet located in the galaxy's Outer Rim Territories. Part of a binary star system, the planet orbited two scorching suns, resulting in the world lacking the necessary surface water to sustain large populations. As a result, many residents of the planet instead drew water from the atmosphere via moisture farms. The planet also had little surface vegetation. It was the homeworld to the native Jawa and Tusken Raider species and of Anakin and Luke Skywalker, who would go on to shape galactic history.\n\nIt saw a population explosion following the search for valuable mining deposits on the planet's silicate surface. Finding the ore to have undesirable metallurgical properties, mining firms left the planet en masse, leaving behind valuable equipment, most notably large sandcrawlers, which were later used by the Jawa population. The planet then became a haven for smugglers and criminal activity, and fell under the influence of the Hutt Clan while scattered, isolated settlements of hard-working inhabitants endured.\n\nGenerally ignored by the galaxy at large, Tatooine gained the notice of the Galactic Empire during the Galactic Civil War when an escape pod carrying two droids in possession of top-secret information landed on the sandy Outer Rim world. The Empire went on to establish a heavier presence on the planet, forging a tenuous relationship with Jabba Desilijic Tiure of the Hutt Clan. Open conflict soon broke out between the Empire and a Rebel Alliance cell on Tatooine that culminated in a battle that left the Empire's hold on the world significantly weakened.\n\nFollowing the death of Jabba and the withdrawal of Imperial forces after the Battle of Endor, an enormous power vacuum occurred on the world, with numerous crime syndicates like the Red Key Raiders attempting to build legitimacy as mining companies. Eventually, former bounty hunter Boba Fett returned and took over Jabba's former territory. Coming into conflict with both the Hutt Clan and the Pyke Syndicate, the new Daimyo was pulled into a gang war that threatened the future of Tatooine. With help from the Mandalorian Din Djarin, Fett rallied the denziens of the settlements Mos Espa and Freetown to push back against the invaders, ushering in a new era of respect between the people of the planet. \n\nFor more information: https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Tatooine",

The resulting gravimetric duel between the gas giants Jestefad and Lefrani over Mustafar heated the planet's core, transforming the lush world into an imbalanced volcanic hellscape. Adapting to life on their devastated homeworld, the arthropodal Mustafarians evolved into two distinct subspecies that cooperated to ensure their continued survival. Legends of Corvax's search for immortality brought the ancient Sith to Mustafar, seeking the same secrets of eternal life.

These very first levels of Coruscant were constructed in 100,000 BBY and eventually rose from the soil into a world-spanning city. The underworld was a haven for bounty hunters, pirates, and criminal gangs, but also harbored war refugees and poor immigrants trying to make a pitiful living. Influential crime families operated in the lower levels of Coruscant, which were patrolled by the underworld police division of the Coruscant Security Force. Devoid of all sunlight, the lower levels were left in a perpetual state of darkness illuminated only by artificial lights for thousands of years. The underworld was polluted and infested with pests and dangerous escaped pets. The very lowest levels of the city were rumored to hold ancient secrets.\n\nSkyscrapers towered above the highest level on Coruscant, Level 5127, on which lay the Galactic City, but under the surface structures the levels of Coruscant descended down all the way to Level 1, which was deemed uninhabitable. Undercity dwellers often had to breathe toxic fumes from millennia of urbanization, while wealthy citizens in the upper levels had access to rich and filtered air. The various levels of Coruscant were accessible by huge portals that also served as ventilation shafts.\n\nFor more information: https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Coruscant_Underworld",

Though purged of its Jedi origins, the Palace retained its ziggurat form as well as its distinctive crown of four Council Towers and the central Palace spire that contained the Emperor's throne room.\n\nBuilt as a Jedi temple by the Four Masters millennia before Sidious' rise to power, the Temple stood on the foundations of the Shrine in the Depths, serving as the home of the Jedi Order throughout the Republic Era. Over the centuries it was rebuilt and expanded several times. In addition to its role as the central hub of all Jedi activities throughout the galaxy, the Temple functioned as a monastery for Jedi Knights and Jedi Masters as well as a school for the training of Padawans and initiates. The Temple contained several key areas such as the Holocron Vault, which housed the Order's closely guarded secrets; the Jedi Archives, the largest repository of information; and the Jedi Council Chamber, where the ruling Jedi High Council convened to discuss galactic events and determine the will of the Force.\n\nAs leaders of the Grand Army of the Republic, the Jedi coordinated the war effort from the Temple on Coruscant during the Clone Wars between the Galactic Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems. Despite the Temple's security, it was infiltrated by the bounty hunter Cad Bane who stole a holocron at the behest of the Sith Lord Darth Sidious. In 19 BBY, the Temple was damaged by a bombing attack masterminded by Padawan Barriss Offee. Following the terrorist attack, the Jedi attempted to remove Palpatine as Supreme Chancellor upon learning of his secret identity as Darth Sidious. As a result, the 501st Legion marched on the Temple under the command of Sidious' Sith apprentice Darth Vader. Labeled as traitors under Order 66, the Jedi were attacked by clone troopers in the Temple and across the galaxy, marking the start of the Great Jedi Purge. With the Sith restored to power, the Jedi Temple became the Imperial Palace.\n\nThe Emperor's death at the Battle of Endor in 4 ABY prompted the citizens of Coruscant to celebrate in the streets of Monument Plaza while Grand Vizier Mas Amedda and his supporters barricaded themselves in the Palace. Around the same time, the Jedi Knight Luke Skywalker recovered fragments of the Great Tree that once stood in the heart of the Jedi Temple. In the final days of the Galactic Civil War, Amedda was placed under virtual house arrest in the Palace by soldiers who were loyal to Fleet Admiral Gallius Rax, the self-proclaimed Counselor to the Empire. He later escaped from the Palace with the help of a gaggle of children by the time of the Battle of Jakku in 5 ABY. \n\nFor more information: https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Imperial_Palace",

It was the location of the Imperial Senate Building, the Avenue of the Core Founders, the Imperial Executive Building, and the Jedi Temple which, after proclamation of the New Order, was rechristened as the Imperial Palace. Other notable locations included 500 Republica, the headquarters of the Naval Intelligence Agency, and the COMPNOR arcology, which contained the central offices of the Imperial Security Bureau.\n\nDuring the Clone Wars, the Confederacy of Independent Systems disabled the central power distribution grid of Coruscant, causing a power outage in the Federal District. The district was also damaged by a Zillo Beast that had been captured on Malastare and taken to the galactic capital. After the Galactic Republic became the Galactic Empire, the Jedi Order's temple became the palace of Galactic Emperor Sheev Palpatine. Following Emperor Palpatine's death in the Battle of Endor, the Empire fought to remain in control of the Federal District during a civil war between the Imperial government and the Coruscanti that supported the New Republic. \n\nFor more information: https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Federal_District",

They used spears, slings, and knives as weapons; they also used hang gliders as vehicles. Although skilled in forest survival and the construction of primitive technology, the Ewoks had yet to progress past stone-level technology when discovered by the Empire.

            "content": "The Confederacy of Independent Systems, abbreviated to CIS, and otherwise known as the Separatist Alliance, the Separatist State, the Separatist Confederacy, or simply referred to as the Separatists, was a united galaxy-wide confederacy formed of outlaying star systems from the Galactic Republic, a democratic union, whom the Confederacy had opposed following a period of political turmoil. Established by fallen Jedi Master Count Dooku of the planet Serenno, who served as its Head of State, the Confederacy was founded from a belief of excessive taxation and corruption within the Republic's Galactic Senate, as well as a general feeling of dissatisfaction towards and neglect by the Republic-centric Core Worlds region of the galaxy. Furthermore, the Confederacy was secretly supported by several major galactic corporations which formed the Confederacy's executive council, including the Trade Federation, led by Viceroy Nute Gunray; the Stalgasin hive, led by Archduke Poggle the Lesser; the InterGalactic Banking Clan, headed by Chairman San Hill; the Techno Union, led by Foreman Wat Tambor; the Commerce Guild, led by Presidente Shu Mai; the Corporate Alliance, led by Magistrate Passel Argente; and the Retail Caucus.\n\nIn 24 BBY, a political crisis had begun which led to escalating tensions between the reigning Republic and the rising Confederacy, established in a galaxy-wide secessionist movement orchestrated by Dooku. Many within the Confederacy, including its parliament of senators, had no desire in fighting their adversaries, as they sought to be free of what they saw as the corruption and tyranny of the Republic. However, in 22 BBY, both governments and their respective military forces became enmeshed in the pan-galactic Clone Wars that had erupted on the planet Geonosis, the first major conflict in a millennium.\n\nIn the following three years of the war, which had raged across the entire galaxy on several fronts, the Confederacy made rapid attempts to cease the Republic's influence. However, unknown to the galaxy or either side, the war was a ploy designed by the Dark Lord of the Sith, Darth Sidious, who led both the Confederacy through Dooku as his Sith Master, and, secretly, the Republic as Supreme Chancellor Sheev Palpatine. The Sith Lord had managed to deceive both parties. By the third year of the war, the Confederacy had suffered several major defeats in the Outer Rim Sieges as the conflict began to approach its end, while the CIS lost many starships in the decisive Battle of Coruscant, which also resulted in the death of Dooku. In the days following their defeat at Coruscant, General Grievous was neutralized on the planet Utapau, leading to the collapse of the Separatist leadership, and the fighting effectively coming to an end.\n\nFollowing both the Jedi's demise and rise of the Galactic Empire, Viceroy Nute Gunray and the other surviving leaders gathered on the planet Mustafar with hopes of securing peace with the newly rising Empire ruled by Galactic Emperor Darth Sidious. However he sent his new apprentice Darth Vader to wipe out them and deactivate the Separatist Droid Army as a threat to his Empire.\n\nWith the end of the Clone Wars, the newly-formed Galactic Empire as the successor to the Old Republic, began to dismantle and absorb the former Confederacy of Independent Systems, with only several holdouts daring to resist the Empire, which were suppressed. But an idealized view of the cause persisted during the Imperial Era, with some still holding secessionist tendencies, even into the Galactic Civil War.\n\nFor more information: https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Confederacy_of_Independent_Systems",

            "content": "The Galactic Republic, also known as the Grand Republic or simply as the Republic, was a democratic federal union spread across light-years of space. Old Republic and first Galactic Republic were terms affixed to the pre-modern Republic that existed until 1032 BBY, with the Old Republic also referring to the modern Republic that was supplanted by the Galactic Empire in 19 BBY. In addition, the term High Republic denoted the era in which the Republic reached the zenith of its power, lasting from around 500 BBY to around 100 BBY. The Republic was founded many millennia before the Battle of Yavin, approximately 25,000 BBY, around the same time as the Jedi Order. The Galactic Senate governed the Republic under the Galactic Constitution, and comprised thousands of senators representing the Republic's member worlds. The Supreme Chancellor was the title of the head of the Republic, elected from ranks of the Senate to lead the government on Coruscant. An ecumenopolis or city-covered planet, referred to as Galactic City, Coruscant was the capital of the Republic and therefore the seat of the Senate.\n\nThe Galactic Republic and it star systems shared sovereignty, and spanned a multiplicity of worlds from the Core Worlds to the Outer Rim Territories, uniting a variety of sentient species, human and alien alike, under one banner. As its power grew, the Republic fought many wars against various opponents such as Mandalorians, the Zygerrian Slave Empire, the Nihil, and several Sith Empires. The Jedi Order, a religious group of Force-sensitives dedicated to the light side of the Force, was sworn to the service of the Senate, and as such the Jedi Knights were hailed as the guardians of peace and justice within the Republic. Centuries of conflict culminated in the fall of the Old Republic, and the last war between the ancient Jedi and Sith concluded with the restoration and rise of the modern Galactic Republic, ushering in the Republic Era which was an age of peace that lasted for a thousand years. The Republic's history was officially reset, and the ages before this event were merged into a collective whole known as the Old Republic-era.\n\nThe Republic entered a period of decline after centuries of expansion and prosperity. Aided by the resurgent Sith Lords, the Separatist Crisis divided the galaxy between the Republic loyalists and the Confederacy of Independent Systems. The Grand Army of the Republic was organized under the leadership of Jedi Generals who led the Republic Military against the Separatist Droid Army during the Clone Wars. However, the conflict had been orchestrated to allow Supreme Chancellor Sheev Palpatine—the alter ego of Darth Sidious, the Dark Lord of the Sith—to control and deceive the Republic in a dictatorial manner. With the end of the war, Sidious initiated the Great Jedi Purge through Order 66 and transformed the Republic into the Galactic Empire by declaring himself Galactic Emperor. The Imperial Senate stood as the last remnant of the Old Republic until it was disbanded by the Emperor at the height of the Imperial Era. In the aftermath of the Galactic Civil War, the Alliance to Restore the Republic was fully reorganized into the New Republic, restoring the Galactic Republic after a generation of Imperial rule.\n\nFor more information: https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Galactic_Republic",

They were a fish-like amphibious humanoid species with salmon-colored skin, webbed hands, high-domed heads and huge, fish-like eyes. They were equally capable of breathing both on land and in water with them being at home in either environment. Male Mon Calamari had protrusions on their chin called \"barbels\" which grew more numerous with age. Most Mon Calamari had salmon-colored skin, often mottled with light and dark patterns, though examples of other skin colors were known. The Mon Calamari are able to descend to depths of up to 30 meters below sea level without requiring breathing or pressure apparatus. Though they can breathe water, they find it somewhat uncomfortable, and use organic gills whenever possible. Mon Calamari could stay underwater for an indefinite period of time, although a frightened Mon Calamari, particularly a juvenile, could drown underwater. They also did not need to decompress when resurfacing. They tended to smell of salt and sea giving them a particular identifiable odor.\n\nFor more information: https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Mon_Calamari/Legends",

Although they established settlements across their aquatic homeworld, most Nautolan civilization was found in the Sabilon region. The most well-known Nautolan was Jedi Master Kit Fisto, a hero of the Clone Wars and at one point a member of the Jedi Council. \n\nNautolans possessed physiology common to amphibious species, including low light vision and excellent swimming skills. Their bony endoskeleton and dense cartilage made them tough and resistant to glancing blows. An egg-laying species, Nautolans emerged from their egg as a tadpole that developed arms, legs, and head-tails during their second year of life. Roughly the same size as a Human infant during this time, their limbs were weak and unable to support their weight, forcing youthful Nautolans to remain in aquatic environments for much of their childhood. They stood an average of 1.8 meters, had smooth green, blue, purple, or brown skin, and large black or dark maroon eyes with lids that were seldom used. They were capable of breathing underwater; however, unlike other water-based species, Nautolans did not experience difficulties out of water.\n\nNautolans possessed exceptional olfactory and pheromone-sensing skills, enhanced by head-tresses. These tendrils were used to detect the emotional state of another being, but were most effective underwater. Within Nautolan culture, the ability to sense pheromone changes was an essential part of the communication process. All Nautolans had sixteen sensory tentacles and multiple hearts, which were capable of beating separately. Like their sense of smell, Nautolan language was also maximized for use underwater and not fully pronounceable in a gaseous atmosphere. Because of the loss in linguistic detail, most Nautolans chose to speak Anselmian or Galactic Basic when traveling off-world. In addition, Nautolans used other communicative cues when submerged, such as reading the swirls in other Nautolans' large eyes. \n\nFor more information: https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Nautolan/Legends",

            "content": "The Quarren, were one of several aquatic sentient species from the planet Dac, called Mon Calamari by off-worlders. The Quarren shared their homeworld with the Mon Calamari, another sentient species hailing from Dac. The Quarren had many conflicts and a tense relationship with the Mon Calamari. However, in order to make their planet prosperous, they were forced to provide resources from the ocean depths so that the Mon Calamari could build starships for off-worlders. \n\nQuarren were cephalopodal or cephalopod-like amphibious humanoids with squid-like heads, at least four tentacles on their faces, and leathery skin. Quarren tentacles were prehensile, and they were able to manipulate food with them. Quarren had small mouths, with two fang-like teeth jutting from their faces on either side, and a long, thin tongue sticking out in between. Quarren had two long protrusions that extended from either side of their faces. In these protrusions were several gill-like structures that were actually aural structures, used for hearing instead of ears.[2] Quarren also had holes on either sides of their neck that were most likely used for breathing. Quarren had two sac-like organs that hung from the back of their heads as well.\n\nThe species was also able to change the color of their skin during mating rituals. Most Quarren had orange skin, although some Quarren had gray-green skin; this trait, however, was extremely rare. Pink or purple-skinned Quarren existed, though presumably in small numbers. All Quarren also had two shimmering blue eyes. Being aquatic in nature, Quarren had to keep their skin moist in order to stay alive, although clawed Quarren seemed to need less moisture than other Quarren. The average Quarren lifespan was 79 standard years.\n\nThere were three different types of Quarren, although the only difference lay in their hands. Some Quarren had suction-tipped fingers, either with three or five fingers. Other Quarren had thick fingers that lacked suction cups on the tips of their fingers, yet had sharp claws instead. Whether these three groups were actually distinct subspecies is unknown.\n\nHaving evolved in the depths of Mon Calamari, Quarren could descend to depths of 300 meters without any breathing or pressure apparatus. However, upon ascending from depths of 50 meters or below, a time, equal to the amount that they had spent below 50 meters, would have to be spared, so to as allow their bodies to decompress and thus adjust to the lower surface/water pressure.\n\nFor more information: https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Quarren/Legends",

            "content": "The Gungans were a sentient, amphibious humanoid race native to the terrestrial planet known as Naboo. Prior to the Invasion of Naboo, an event that took place in 32 BBY, the Gungans were a largely isolationist society. They were able to combine machinery with biology. They lived in large bubble-like domes under water. Gungans had strong leg muscles for swimming and were aided by their long fin-like ears. Their somewhat lanky arms ended in four-fingered hands, and their feet had three stubby toes each. Females tended to be slightly smaller with sleeker faces. They often tied their long ears back.\n\nWhile most spacefarers would dismiss Gungans as primitives, they developed an advanced, albeit unique, technology. They grew the basic structures of buildings, vehicles and technology and adorned them with artistic flourishes and organic lines. This gave Gungan technology a very fluid, non-rectilinear look.\n\nThe power source for Gungan technology was a mysterious blue-white energy \"goo\" that was mined in the depths of Naboo's oceans. The viscous plasmic material formed the basis of Gungan weaponry as well.\n\nThe Gungans had mastered energy field technology for a number of uses. Their underwater cities employed hydrostatic fields to create large bubbles of atmosphere within which they dwell. Similarly, Gungan ground troops carried portable frames which generate a protective energy field capable of deflecting blaster fire. In large-scale combat, giant Gungan shield generators could create an immense umbrella of protective shield energy that could stop laser bolts and physical objects with great kinetic energy.\n\nDespite mastering this bizarre technology, Gungans still employed beasts of burden for transportation. Their most common mount was the kaadu, a wingless reptavian which Gungans adorned with feathers and rode into combat. Other favored Gungan mounts included the large, stubborn falumpaset. For truly heavy loads, the Gungans domesticated the fambaa, a nine-meter tall, quadrupedal amphibian.\n\nThe Gungans maintained a large standing-armed force called the Gungan Grand Army. This huge collection of foot soldiers carried cestas, electropoles, and atlatls capable of hurling plasmic energy spheres (or boomers, as Gungans called them). Gungan catapults hurled even larger boomers over great distances.\n\nThe Gungans were ruled by a Boss and his Rep Council from the High Tower Board Room of Otoh Gunga. The Gungans had an uneasy relationship with the Naboo, the human colonists on the planet. Many Naboo looked down upon the Gungans, thinking them as primitive. The Gungans in turn tried to avoid any contact with the surface-dwellers. \n\nFor more information: https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Gungan/Legends",

            "content": "The Great Jedi Purge (19 BBY—3 BBY), also known as the war against the Jedi, was the sixteen year—long genocide that saw the remnants of the Jedi Order hunted by the Galactic Empire after the initial execution of Order 66, in which clone troopers slaughtered the Jedi upon the Sith Lord Darth Sidious' command. After the Imperial Inquisitorius erased all traces of the Jedi Order they could find from existence and with most survivors having met their demise, their objective was completed and the Jedi were all but extinct, and the Inquisitors themselves seamlessly vanishing as well.\n\nThe genocide against the Jedi traced its origins to the ancient wars between the Jedi and the Sith, who were nearly eliminated around 1032 BBY. The Sith in fact continued operating in secret, plotting their eventual destruction of the Jedi. A millennium after the defeat of the Sith, Darth Sidious, using his public persona of senator and then Supreme Chancellor Sheev Palpatine, manipulated and deceived the galaxy into the Clone Wars as a pretext for gaining emergency executive power over the Galactic Republic. He used the war to manipulate and deceive the Galactic Senate into giving his office virtually unchecked executive power in the name of security. In addition, the clone army that provided the Republic with its military force had secretly been implanted with bio-chips by its Sith creators that, upon activation, would trigger total compliance and force the clones into killing their Jedi leaders.\n\nThe Great Jedi Purge began at the end of the Clone Wars. Anakin Skywalker, a Jedi Knight believed to be the Chosen One destined to destroy the Sith, discovered that Palpatine was Darth Sidious and informed Jedi Master Mace Windu. In what Sidious would publicly label the \"Jedi rebellion,\" Windu and three other Masters confronted the Chancellor, who killed the three Masters and engaged Windu in a lightsaber duel. Skywalker, who sought power from Sidious in order to save his wife, Padmé Amidala, from death, betrayed and incapacitated Windu before the Jedi Master could kill the Sith Lord. Sidious then killed Windu, and Skywalker became the Sith Lord Darth Vader and led the Siege of the Jedi Temple, killing everyone inside it. While Vader carried out the assault, Sidious initiated Order 66, with the latter causing the clones' biochips to brainwash them into betraying and slaughtering the Jedi, ultimately leading to the Jedi Order being destroyed. With the Jedi branded traitors and the Clone Wars at an end, Sidious declared himself Emperor and transformed the Republic into the Galactic Empire.\n\nFor more information: https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Order_66",

The galaxy was a vast composite of over 400 billion estimated stars and over 3.2 billion habitable systems orbiting around a supermassive black hole known as the Galactic Centre, which existed at the heart of the galaxy. The four galactic arms rotated around this black hole across a diameter of around 120,000 light-years. It was home to countless sentient species and star systems.\n\nThe galaxy would serve as the setting for trade, politics, and war throughout galactic history. In historical memory, the galaxy would see the successive eras of the Galactic Republic, Galactic Empire, New Republic, among others, and was home to the Force-sensitive sects such as the Jedi Order and Sith and numerous cultural groups such as the Mandalorians.\n\nFor more information: https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/The_galaxy",

Spillover piracy from the Outer Rim affected the region. Those headed towards the Outer Rim saw it as the last taste of civilization, while those heading corewards saw it as the last grasp of frontier living.

The Order was originally established on Ahch-To in the Unknown Regions. In later years, the Jedi Grand Temple on the Core World Coruscant served as the hub of all Jedi activity in the galaxy. The Temple was also a training school for younglings and Padawans, who learned the ways of the Force under the supervision of Jedi Masters, twelve of whom were elected to serve on the Jedi High Council—the Order's highest governing authority. The High Council's staff officers were the Grand Master, who functioned as the leader of the Order and was a title reserved for the wisest Jedi Master, and the Master of the Order, who served as the Council's appointed leader. The Jedi Code governed the Order's way of life; therefore, every Jedi was duty-bound to observe and uphold the Code or else risk expulsion from the Order.\n\nFor more information: https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Jedi_Order",

            "content": "The Force was an energy field created by all life that bound everything in the universe together. It was known by a variety of names throughout galactic history: It was called the Ashla by the Lasats, It by the dianoga Omi, the Life Current by the Mustafarians, the Tide by the Lew'elans, the Sight by the Chiss, the Life Wind by the Zeffonians, the Great Presence by the Pathfinders of the Chaos, the Luminous Mist by the Mist-Weavers, the Unity by the Sorcerers of Tund, and as the Beyond by the Magys and her people. The Force was created by life, and therefore it resided in all life forms. It was especially powerful in a select group of individuals who were born with a high concentration of midi-chlorians—microscopic, intelligent lifeforms that formed a symbiotic relationship with and communicated the will of the Force to their host—in their blood. These people were deemed Force-sensitive, and were capable of consciously sensing the Force. With this conscious sense of the Force came the ability to harness it, allowing Force-sensitives to access various Force powers. Unlike organic beings, droids and other artificial constructs existed outside of the Force. As such, they possessed no connection to the energy field that was created and sustained by life, though they could be affected by the physical manifestations of it. Apart from its scientific aspect, the Force was the basis of various religious organizations, who held differing views as to the nature and purpose of the Force. These included the Church of the Force, the Guardians of the Whills, and most notably the Jedi and Sith Orders. In addition, the Lasats believed that the Force was the \"spirit\" of the galaxy.\n\nThe Force as a recorded concept existed for well over twenty-five thousand years. There were two overarching and symbiotic aspects of the Force. The Living Force was the energy of all life, which, in turn, fed into the Cosmic Force—which bound everything together and communicated the will of the Force through the midi-chlorians. The Jedi followed a code of selflessness and service to others; therefore, they adhered to the light side of the Force, one of two methods of using the all-encompassing energy field. The Jedi's adversaries, the Sith, coveted strength and power through the dark side of the Force. Their opposing philosophies led to millennia of cyclical conflict between the two orders, which resulted in both the extinction of the Sith and the near annihilation of the Jedi.\n\nFor more information: https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/The_Force",

            "content": "The Grand Army of the Republic (GAR), also known as the Great Army of the Republic, the Republic Army, the Grand Army, the Galactic Army, or simply the clone army, was the army branch of the Republic Military throughout the duration of the Clone Wars. At the time of the Battle of Geonosis, the Galactic Republic activated hundreds of thousands of clone troopers to fight the Separatist Droid Army of the Confederacy of Independent Systems. In addition to human clones, all grown from the bounty hunter Jango Fett's genetic template, the GAR also had Jedi and other non-clone leadership as well as regular conscripted soldiers, though they formed the minority of soldiers in the Grand Army.\n\nDuring the waning years of the Republic, Jedi Master Sifo-Dyas contacted the government of Kamino to commission the creation of a clone army, convinced that the galaxy would be consumed by war. As thousands of star systems joined the Separatist movement, the Galactic Senate invested wartime powers in Supreme Chancellor Sheev Palpatine. As a result, the Grand Army of the Republic was formally established, comprising thousands of clone soldiers with millions more being developed in Kaminoan facilities by the start of the Clone Wars. The Jedi Knights, having served as peacekeepers for a thousand years, became Jedi Generals when the Senate called on the Jedi Order to lead the Grand Army against the enemies of the Republic.\n\nFor three years, the Grand Army fought on all fronts across a war-torn galaxy, from the campaigns in the Outer Rim Territories to a Separatist attack on the Republic capital of Coruscant. Through the machinations of Palpatine, revealed to the Jedi as the Sith Lord Darth Sidious, who was behind the war and deceiving both sides, the clones were ultimately forced to turn against their Jedi leaders, slaughtering them throughout the galaxy and inside the Jedi Temple as directed by Order 66. After Sidious declared himself Emperor of the Galactic Empire, the Grand Army of the Republic was absorbed by the New Order and reorganized into the Imperial Army, allowing the remaining clone troopers to serve as the first generation of stormtroopers.\n\nFor more information: https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Grand_Army_of_the_Republic",

            "content": "The Confederacy of Independent Systems Navy (CIS Navy) was the naval branch of the Confederacy of Independent Systems' military during the Clone Wars. The navy, sometimes referred to as the Confederacy navy or the Confederacy fleet, was created sometime after 24 BBY during the Separatist Crisis, where they would fight against the naval forces of the Galactic Republic. Employing a variety of different classes of warships of different sizes, the Confederacy navy assisted in the transportation of the Separatist Droid Army to target planets, while they also engaged in ship-to-ship combat with Republic Navy.\nUnder its banner, the Confederacy navy's starships and starfighters were given a new color scheme with the onset of the Clone Wars. Designated areas of vessels were painted in blue markings, and the port and starboard hulls of warships adorned the Confederacy's hex emblem to indicate their allegiance. These starships that served within the navy were manufactured by various contracted production companies, such as Pammant Docks and Free Dac Volunteers Engineering Corps, which constructed the Providence-class Dreadnoughts, Recusant-class light destroyers and Subjugator-class heavy cruisers. Furthermore, as a result of their ties to the Trade Federation, the Confederacy was granted the use of the Federation fleet's Lucrehulk-class LH-3210 cargo freighters, of which were modified into Lucrehulk-class Battleships for wartime.\n\nThroughout its operational history, the Separatist armada fought in several pivotal battles and campaigns during the Clone Wars against the Republic. Such battles included the Battle of Christophsis, the Malevolence campaign, the Battle of Ryloth, and the Battle of Sullust. The navy also saw action within a blockade of the Quellor sector, the destruction of the Nightsisters on the planet Dathomir, the Outer Rim Sieges, and the decisive Battle of Coruscant, which resulted in the loss of a third of the deployed ships being destroyed.\n\nFollowing the end of the war, which resulted in the destruction of both the Confederacy and its navy and the transformation of the Republic into the Galactic Empire, several Separatist warships, such as the Providence and Lucrehulk-classes were sent to be dismantled on the planet Bracca. However, some elements of the Confederacy navy survived the war and disassembly and were accumulated by several rebel groups, such as the resistance group led by Berch Teller, who used a makeshift Providence-class Dreadnought, and the Alliance to Restore the Republic, who made use of former Separatist dreadnoughts, destroyers, and communication frigates in their fleets.\n\nCapital Ships:\nProvidence-class Dreadnoughts\nSubjugator-class Heavy Cruiser\nMalevolence (only 1 exists)\nLucrehulk-class LH-3210 Cargo Freighters\n\nDestroyers:\nRecusant-class Light Destroyer\n\nFrigates:\nMunificent-class C3 Frigate\n\nLight Craft:\nHMP Droid Gunships\nDroch-class Boarding Ship\nMaxillipede Shuttle\nSheathipede-class Transport Shuttle\n\nStarfighters:\nVulture-class Droid Starfighter\nDroid Tri-Fighter\nHyena-class Bomber",

            "content": "The Clone Wars (22–19 BBY) was a galaxy-spanning conflict between the Galactic Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems, which had seceded from the Republic. Also referred to as the Clone War, it was named after the clone troopers used by the Grand Army of the Republic against the Separatist Droid Army. With both being fielded in enormous numbers by each respective side, they were the largest military forces in galactic history, and fighting between them swept through the galaxy for three, nearly four, years.\n\nPrior to the conflict, Darth Sidious, under his alter ego Sheev Palpatine, had spent years amassing political power, eventually rising to become the Republic's Supreme Chancellor. Through his Sith apprentice Count Dooku, he sparked the Separatist Crisis, causing thousands of Republic star systems to secede and form a new government as the Confederacy, with Dooku as its Head of State. Beginning with the First Battle of Geonosis, the conflict quickly spread throughout the galaxy with both sides scoring significant victories. At different points in the war it seemed that either side was likely to triumph over the other. At the war's outset, both sides vied for control of major hyperspace lanes to gain strategic advantage.\n\nBattles, skirmishes, raids and other actions continued for the next two years, with notable battles occurring on Ryloth, Felucia, Malastare, and Kamino. During this time, the Separatists developed various super weapons, including more traditional weapons such as the ion cannons of the battleship Malevolence, as well as biological weapons such as a variant of the Blue Shadow Virus. Meanwhile, the Republic launched several key offensives, including the Second Battle of Geonosis, which obliterated Geonosis' battle droid foundries, and a failed Jedi-led operation to capture Supreme Commander of the Droid Army General Grievous at Saleucami. Amidst the escalating conflict, many planets—including Mandalore and other members of the Council of Neutral Systems—struggled to maintain their neutrality, but found it difficult to escape the carnage.\n\nFor more information: https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Clone_Wars",

            "content": "The Confederacy of Independent Systems, abbreviated to CIS, and otherwise known as the Separatist Alliance, the Separatist State, the Separatist Confederacy, or simply referred to as the Separatists, was a united galaxy-wide confederacy formed of outlaying star systems from the Galactic Republic, a democratic union, whom the Confederacy had opposed following a period of political turmoil. Established by fallen Jedi Master Count Dooku of the planet Serenno, who served as its Head of State, the Confederacy was founded from a belief of excessive taxation and corruption within the Republic's Galactic Senate, as well as a general feeling of dissatisfaction towards and neglect by the Republic-centric Core Worlds region of the galaxy. Furthermore, the Confederacy was secretly supported by several major galactic corporations which formed the Confederacy's executive council, including the Trade Federation, led by Viceroy Nute Gunray; the Stalgasin hive, led by Archduke Poggle the Lesser; the InterGalactic Banking Clan, headed by Chairman San Hill; the Techno Union, led by Foreman Wat Tambor; the Commerce Guild, led by Presidente Shu Mai; the Corporate Alliance, led by Magistrate Passel Argente; and the Retail Caucus.\n\nIn 24 BBY, a political crisis had begun which led to escalating tensions between the reigning Republic and the rising Confederacy, established in a galaxy-wide secessionist movement orchestrated by Dooku. Many within the Confederacy, including its parliament of senators, had no desire in fighting their adversaries, as they sought to be free of what they saw as the corruption and tyranny of the Republic. However, in 22 BBY, both governments and their respective military forces became enmeshed in the pan-galactic Clone Wars that had erupted on the planet Geonosis, the first major conflict in a millennium.\n\nIn the following three years of the war, which had raged across the entire galaxy on several fronts, the Confederacy made rapid attempts to cease the Republic's influence. However, unknown to the galaxy or either side, the war was a ploy designed by the Dark Lord of the Sith, Darth Sidious, who led both the Confederacy through Dooku as his Sith Master, and, secretly, the Republic as Supreme Chancellor Sheev Palpatine. The Sith Lord had managed to deceive both parties. By the third year of the war, the Confederacy had suffered several major defeats in the Outer Rim Sieges as the conflict began to approach its end, while the CIS lost many starships in the decisive Battle of Coruscant, which also resulted in the death of Dooku. In the days following their defeat at Coruscant, General Grievous was neutralized on the planet Utapau, leading to the collapse of the Separatist leadership, and the fighting effectively coming to an end.\n\nFollowing both the Jedi's demise and rise of the Galactic Empire, Viceroy Nute Gunray and the other surviving leaders gathered on the planet Mustafar with hopes of securing peace with the newly rising Empire ruled by Galactic Emperor Darth Sidious. However he sent his new apprentice Darth Vader to wipe out them and deactivate the Separatist Droid Army as a threat to his Empire.\n\nWith the end of the Clone Wars, the newly-formed Galactic Empire as the successor to the Old Republic, began to dismantle and absorb the former Confederacy of Independent Systems, with only several holdouts daring to resist the Empire, which were suppressed. But an idealized view of the cause persisted during the Imperial Era, with some still holding secessionist tendencies, even into the Galactic Civil War.",

Old Republic and first Galactic Republic were terms affixed to the pre-modern Republic that existed until 1032 BBY, with the Old Republic also referring to the modern Republic that was supplanted by the Galactic Empire in 19 BBY. In addition, the term High Republic denoted the era in which the Republic reached the zenith of its power, lasting from around 500 BBY to around 100 BBY. The Republic was founded many millennia before the Battle of Yavin, approximately 25,000 BBY, around the same time as the Jedi Order. The Galactic Senate governed the Republic under the Galactic Constitution, and comprised thousands of senators representing the Republic's member worlds. The Supreme Chancellor was the title of the head of the Republic, elected from ranks of the Senate to lead the government on Coruscant. An ecumenopolis or city-covered planet, referred to as Galactic City, Coruscant was the capital of the Republic and therefore the seat of the Senate.\n\nThe Galactic Republic and its star systems shared sovereignty, and spanned a multiplicity of worlds from the Core Worlds to the Outer Rim Territories, uniting a variety of sentient species, human and alien alike, under one banner. As its power grew, the Republic fought many wars against various opponents such as Mandalorians, the Zygerrian Slave Empire, the Nihil, and several Sith Empires. The Jedi Order, a religious group of Force-sensitives dedicated to the light side of the Force, was sworn to the service of the Senate, and as such the Jedi Knights were hailed as the guardians of peace and justice within the Republic. Centuries of conflict culminated in the fall of the Old Republic, and the last war between the ancient Jedi and Sith concluded with the restoration and rise of the modern Galactic Republic, ushering in the Republic Era which was an age of peace that lasted for a thousand years. The Republic's history was officially reset, and the ages before this event were merged into a collective whole known as the Old Republic-era.\n\nThe Republic entered a period of decline after centuries of expansion and prosperity. Aided by the resurgent Sith Lords, the Separatist Crisis divided the galaxy between the Republic loyalists and the Confederacy of Independent Systems. The Grand Army of the Republic was organized under the leadership of Jedi Generals who led the Republic Military against the Separatist Droid Army during the Clone Wars. However, the conflict had been orchestrated to allow Supreme Chancellor Sheev Palpatine—the alter ego of Darth Sidious, the Dark Lord of the Sith—to control and deceive the Republic in a dictatorial manner. With the end of the war, Sidious initiated the Great Jedi Purge through Order 66 and transformed the Republic into the Galactic Empire by declaring himself Galactic Emperor. The Imperial Senate stood as the last remnant of the Old Republic until it was disbanded by the Emperor at the height of the Imperial Era. In the aftermath of the Galactic Civil War, the Alliance to Restore the Republic was fully reorganized into the New Republic, restoring the Galactic Republic after a generation of Imperial rule.",

Though debated by historians, it was generally believed that Coruscant was the original homeworld of humanity. Coruscant was at one point also historically the home of the ancient Taung and Zhell. Noted for its cosmopolitan culture and towering skyscrapers, Coruscant's population consisted of trillions of citizens hailing from a vast array of both humanoid and alien species. In addition, Coruscant's strategic location at the end of several major trade routes enabled it to grow in power and influence, causing the city-planet to surpass its early rivals and become the hub of galactic culture, education, finance, fine arts, politics and technology. It was the location of several major landmarks, including the Jedi Temple, Monument Plaza, and the Senate Building. \nFor more information: https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Coruscant",

The Kaliida Shoals Medical Center, located in the Ryndellia system, was a Haven-class medical station, as were the Ord Cestus medical station and Felucia Medical Station HCTFF2. The stations were designed so that from above, they looked like the Republic crest.\nHaven-class medical stations were medical space stations manufactured by VenteX Construction Yards built around a long central shaft, which comprised the longest axis of the station. The cylindrical central hub had eight equidistant protrusions, which included docking areas for starships such as Venator-class Star Destroyers and Pelta-class frigates. From above, the station's shape resembled the Republic crest. The stations could carry a maximum of 80,000 patients at any one time.\nFor more information: https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Haven-class_medical_station",

Most of its surface was covered with glaciers and frozen ice plains. Another third of the planet was covered by oceans. The temperature, although always frigid, was known to drop to -60°C come nightfall. Although devoid of intelligent life, Hoth was home to fifteen subspecies of tauntauns, which were commonly used by Rebels as a means of transport, and which Han Solo cut open to use as shelter to keep Luke Skywalker and himself warm during a snowstorm. It was also home to a species of towering predators known as wampas. During his stay on Hoth, Skywalker was captured by a wampa and was hung upside down in the wampa's cave, waiting to be eaten. Using the power of the Force, Skywalker managed to get his hands on his lightsaber and cut himself down from the roof and sever the wampa's right arm. The planet also had a number of \"crystalline geysers.\"\n\nFor more information: https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Hoth",

            "content": "Tatooine was a sparsely inhabited circumbinary desert planet located in the galaxy's Outer Rim Territories. Part of a binary star system, the planet orbited two scorching suns, resulting in the world lacking the necessary surface water to sustain large populations. As a result, many residents of the planet instead drew water from the atmosphere via moisture farms. The planet also had little surface vegetation. It was the homeworld to the native Jawa and Tusken Raider species and of Anakin and Luke Skywalker, who would go on to shape galactic history.\n\nIt saw a population explosion following the search for valuable mining deposits on the planet's silicate surface. Finding the ore to have undesirable metallurgical properties, mining firms left the planet en masse, leaving behind valuable equipment, most notably large sandcrawlers, which were later used by the Jawa population. The planet then became a haven for smugglers and criminal activity, and fell under the influence of the Hutt Clan while scattered, isolated settlements of hard-working inhabitants endured.\n\nGenerally ignored by the galaxy at large, Tatooine gained the notice of the Galactic Empire during the Galactic Civil War when an escape pod carrying two droids in possession of top-secret information landed on the sandy Outer Rim world. The Empire went on to establish a heavier presence on the planet, forging a tenuous relationship with Jabba Desilijic Tiure of the Hutt Clan. Open conflict soon broke out between the Empire and a Rebel Alliance cell on Tatooine that culminated in a battle that left the Empire's hold on the world significantly weakened.\n\nFollowing the death of Jabba and the withdrawal of Imperial forces after the Battle of Endor, an enormous power vacuum occurred on the world, with numerous crime syndicates like the Red Key Raiders attempting to build legitimacy as mining companies. Eventually, former bounty hunter Boba Fett returned and took over Jabba's former territory. Coming into conflict with both the Hutt Clan and the Pyke Syndicate, the new Daimyo was pulled into a gang war that threatened the future of Tatooine. With help from the Mandalorian Din Djarin, Fett rallied the denziens of the settlements Mos Espa and Freetown to push back against the invaders, ushering in a new era of respect between the people of the planet. \n\nFor more information: https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Tatooine",

It was a mist-covered swamp world with a hot, humid and fetid climate maintained by thick swampy rain that fell almost perpetually. The world was a hotbed of life and its environment was fairly representative of the sentient Hutt species that inhabited the world.[14] The influence of the Hutts made the world an important location. The planet's surface was covered with numerous bogs with what little solid land there was claimed by the Hutts and used to support their homes.\n\nThe Hutts built only a handful of spaceports on the surface of Nal Hutta in order to connect their towns, settlements, and palaces, as the planet received few visitors due to most business with offworlders being conducted on the planet's largest moon, Nar Shaddaa. The foremost of these spaceports was the planet's capital city, Bilbousa, a sprawling mess covered in arching roots that spread out from looming bulbous pods. Within sight of the city was the Palace of Gardulla Besadii the Elder, one of the largest buildings on Nal Hutta, which served as the occasional headquarters of the Grand Hutt Council, the ruling body that both worked and led the Hutt Clan. Under the Hutt's control, the planet shared a reputation with Nar Shaddaa for being polluted and dangerous, but played a leading role in the galaxy's shadow economy.\n\nFor more information: https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Nal_Hutta",

Once a garden world nourished by the Bright Star artifact, its orbit was shifted when Lady Corvax unleashed the energies of the Bright Star in an attempt to return her husband to life. The resulting gravimetric duel between the gas giants Jestefad and Lefrani over Mustafar heated the planet's core, transforming the lush world into an imbalanced volcanic hellscape. Adapting to life on their devastated homeworld, the arthropodal Mustafarians evolved into two distinct subspecies that cooperated to ensure their continued survival. Legends of Corvax's search for immortality brought the ancient Sith to Mustafar, seeking the same secrets of eternal life. There, they built a temple over a locus in the dark side of the Force, above the buried ruins of Corvax Fortress. \nFor more information: https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Mustafar",

The underworld was a haven for bounty hunters, pirates, and criminal gangs, but also harbored war refugees and poor immigrants trying to make a pitiful living. Influential crime families operated in the lower levels of Coruscant, which were patrolled by the underworld police division of the Coruscant Security Force. Devoid of all sunlight, the lower levels were left in a perpetual state of darkness illuminated only by artificial lights for thousands of years. The underworld was polluted and infested with pests and dangerous escaped pets. The very lowest levels of the city were rumored to hold ancient secrets.\n\nSkyscrapers towered above the highest level on Coruscant, Level 5127, on which lay the Galactic City, but under the surface structures the levels of Coruscant descended down all the way to Level 1, which was deemed uninhabitable. Undercity dwellers often had to breathe toxic fumes from millennia of urbanization, while wealthy citizens in the upper levels had access to rich and filtered air. The various levels of Coruscant were accessible by huge portals that also served as ventilation shafts.\n\nFor more information: https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Coruscant_Underworld",

            "content": "The Imperial Palace, also known as the Emperor's palace and known formerly as the Jedi Grand Temple, the Coruscant temple or simply the Jedi Temple, was the official residence of the Dark Lord of the Sith and Galactic Emperor Darth Sidious located in the Palace Court of the Federal District of Imperial City on Coruscant, the capital planet of the Galactic Empire during the Imperial Era. Though purged of its Jedi origins, the Palace retained its ziggurat form as well as its distinctive crown of four Council Towers and the central Palace spire that contained the Emperor's throne room.\n\nBuilt as a Jedi temple by the Four Masters millennia before Sidious' rise to power, the Temple stood on the foundations of the Shrine in the Depths, serving as the home of the Jedi Order throughout the Republic Era. Over the centuries it was rebuilt and expanded several times. In addition to its role as the central hub of all Jedi activities throughout the galaxy, the Temple functioned as a monastery for Jedi Knights and Jedi Masters as well as a school for the training of Padawans and initiates. The Temple contained several key areas such as the Holocron Vault, which housed the Order's closely guarded secrets; the Jedi Archives, the largest repository of information; and the Jedi Council Chamber, where the ruling Jedi High Council convened to discuss galactic events and determine the will of the Force.\n\nAs leaders of the Grand Army of the Republic, the Jedi coordinated the war effort from the Temple on Coruscant during the Clone Wars between the Galactic Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems. Despite the Temple's security, it was infiltrated by the bounty hunter Cad Bane who stole a holocron at the behest of the Sith Lord Darth Sidious. In 19 BBY, the Temple was damaged by a bombing attack masterminded by Padawan Barriss Offee. Following the terrorist attack, the Jedi attempted to remove Palpatine as Supreme Chancellor upon learning of his secret identity as Darth Sidious. As a result, the 501st Legion marched on the Temple under the command of Sidious' Sith apprentice Darth Vader. Labeled as traitors under Order 66, the Jedi were attacked by clone troopers in the Temple and across the galaxy, marking the start of the Great Jedi Purge. With the Sith restored to power, the Jedi Temple became the Imperial Palace.\n\nThe Emperor's death at the Battle of Endor in 4 ABY prompted the citizens of Coruscant to celebrate in the streets of Monument Plaza while Grand Vizier Mas Amedda and his supporters barricaded themselves in the Palace. Around the same time, the Jedi Knight Luke Skywalker recovered fragments of the Great Tree that once stood in the heart of the Jedi Temple. In the final days of the Galactic Civil War, Amedda was placed under virtual house arrest in the Palace by soldiers who were loyal to Fleet Admiral Gallius Rax, the self-proclaimed Counselor to the Empire. He later escaped from the Palace with the help of a gaggle of children by the time of the Battle of Jakku in 5 ABY. \n\nFor more information: https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Imperial_Palace",

            "content": "The Great Jedi Purge (19 BBY—3 BBY), also known as the war against the Jedi, was the sixteen year—long genocide that saw the remnants of the Jedi Order hunted by the Galactic Empire after the initial execution of Order 66, in which clone troopers slaughtered the Jedi upon the Sith Lord Darth Sidious' command at the end of the Clone Wars. After the Imperial Inquisitorius erased all traces of the Jedi Order they could find from existence and with most survivors having met their demise, their objective was completed and the Jedi were all but extinct, and the Inquisitors themselves seamlessly vanishing as well.\n\nThe genocide against the Jedi traced its origins to the ancient wars between the Jedi and the Sith, who were nearly eliminated around 1032 BBY. The Sith in fact continued operating in secret, plotting their eventual destruction of the Jedi. A millennium after the defeat of the Sith, Darth Sidious, using his public persona of senator and then Supreme Chancellor Sheev Palpatine, manipulated and deceived the galaxy into the Clone Wars as a pretext for gaining emergency executive power over the Galactic Republic. He used the war to manipulate and deceive the Galactic Senate into giving his office virtually unchecked executive power in the name of security. In addition, the clone army that provided the Republic with its military force had secretly been implanted with bio-chips by its Sith creators that, upon activation, would trigger total compliance and force the clones into killing their Jedi leaders.\n\nThe Great Jedi Purge began at the end of the Clone Wars. Anakin Skywalker, a Jedi Knight believed to be the Chosen One destined to destroy the Sith, discovered that Palpatine was Darth Sidious and informed Jedi Master Mace Windu. In what Sidious would publicly label the \"Jedi rebellion,\" Windu and three other Masters confronted the Chancellor, who killed the three Masters and engaged Windu in a lightsaber duel. Skywalker, who sought power from Sidious in order to save his wife, Padmé Amidala, from death, betrayed and incapacitated Windu before the Jedi Master could kill the Sith Lord. Sidious then killed Windu, and Skywalker became the Sith Lord Darth Vader and led the Siege of the Jedi Temple, killing everyone inside it. While Vader carried out the assault, Sidious initiated Order 66, with the latter causing the clones' biochips to brainwash them into betraying and slaughtering the Jedi, ultimately leading to the Jedi Order being destroyed. With the Jedi branded traitors and the Clone Wars at an end, Sidious declared himself Emperor and transformed the Republic into the Galactic Empire.",

            "comment": "The Galaxy",
            "content": "The galaxy, as it was commonly referred to, was one of trillions of galaxies in the observable universe. The galaxy was a vast composite of over 400 billion estimated stars and over 3.2 billion habitable systems orbiting around a supermassive black hole known as the Galactic Centre, which existed at the heart of the galaxy. The four galactic arms rotated around this black hole across a diameter of around 120,000 light-years. It was home to countless sentient species and star systems.\n\nThe galaxy also had 4 dwarf satellite galaxies that Companion Aurek/Rishi Maze (houses the planet of Kamino). The first dwarf galaxy, Companion Aurek, was only accessible through the Rishi system where a hyperspace lane called Zareca String connected Companion Aurek to the main Star Wars galaxy. It rests vertically to the galactic plane of the main galaxy. The second dwarf galaxy, Companion Besh, is a bit farther from the main galaxy than Companion Aurek and has never been traveled to outside of probe droids. This dwarf galaxy houses the Tof species. Companion Cresh was the third dwarf galaxy and has never been explored, due to how far it was from the galaxy. Companion Grek is the fourth dwarf galaxy and has never been explored, lying far beyond Companion Besh.\n\nThe galaxy would serve as the setting for trade, politics, and war throughout galactic history. In historical memory, the galaxy would see the successive eras of the Galactic Republic, Galactic Empire, New Republic, among others, and was home to the Force-sensitive sects such as the Jedi Order and Sith and numerous cultural groups such as the Mandalorians.\n\nThe galaxy consists of many regions, these being the Deep Core which is the innermost core and consists of highly packed stars and houses the supermassive black hole at the center of the galaxy. The core worlds are the second-most inner core and house the richest, most important, and most populated planets in the galaxy (with Coruscant being the most populated planet in the galaxy at 3 trillion). The Colonies, the third-most inner core, was the first area outside of the core worlds to be colonized. Colonie worlds are very wealthy and heavy populated, similar to the Core Worlds, and was the economic engine for the galaxy. Inner Rim Territories is the fourth-most inner region, mainly referred to just as \"The Rim\". Although not as economically powerful as the Colonies or Core Worlds, it held great strategic value during wars and had some notable planets. The Expansion Region, the fifth-most inner region, is a region full of resources that were exploited by powerful corporations. This has left only a handful of planets with enough resources to be economically viable while the rest of the region has been mostly depleted of resources. The Mid Rim, the sixth-most inner region, is one of the least populated rims due to its low amount of resources. This region is gave lots of room for settlers to spread out and colonize, with multiple notable planets coming from this region such as Malastare and Naboo. This region largely focused on low-cost manufacturing and agriculture to create a successful economy. The Outer Rim Territories was the largest region of the galaxy and the outer core of the galaxy (at least eastward of the Galactic Core). The Hutt Cartel controls a good amount of this space, along with other criminal organizations due to its distance from the central government on Coruscant. This region is run by lawlessness and crime. The only exceptions were planets close to major hyperspace trade routes. The Unknown Regions referred to areas that had not been directly surveyed by Republic or Imperial scouts. It was most commonly applied to the less-known parts of the galaxy's western disk, a quadrant stretching roughly between Bakura and the Imperial Remnant. However, the term also applied to the galaxy's halo of gas, dust, and stars, as well as the satellite galaxies. Wild Space was the frontier of galactic society and was not a formal label, but was applied to the unsettled galactic fringe and other parts of the galaxy with negligible colonization or development. The Galactic Rim was located on the edge of the galaxy and was remote to most civilisation and much was not known about it. The Slice, a vast region of space between the Perlemian and the Corellian Run generally considered the center of galactic civilization and commerce. At its tip was the Arrowhead, encompassing the Core Worlds part of the Slice, with Coruscant at its point. The Arrowhead's other two vertices traditionally fell on Vento on the Perlemian and on Corellia itself, on the Run.",

They were a fish-like amphibious humanoid species with salmon-colored skin, webbed hands, high-domed heads and huge, fish-like eyes. They were equally capable of breathing both on land and in water with them being at home in either environment. Male Mon Calamari had protrusions on their chin called \"barbels\" which grew more numerous with age. Most Mon Calamari had salmon-colored skin, often mottled with light and dark patterns, though examples of other skin colors were known. The Mon Calamari are able to descend to depths of up to 30 meters below sea level without requiring breathing or pressure apparatus. Though they can breathe water, they find it somewhat uncomfortable, and use organic gills whenever possible. Mon Calamari could stay underwater for an indefinite period of time, although a frightened Mon Calamari, particularly a juvenile, could drown underwater. They also did not need to decompress when resurfacing. They tended to smell of salt and sea giving them a particular identifiable odor.\n\nFor more information: https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Mon_Calamari/Legends",

Although they established settlements across their aquatic homeworld, most Nautolan civilization was found in the Sabilon region. The most well-known Nautolan was Jedi Master Kit Fisto, a hero of the Clone Wars and at one point a member of the Jedi Council. \n\nNautolans possessed physiology common to amphibious species, including low light vision and excellent swimming skills. Their bony endoskeleton and dense cartilage made them tough and resistant to glancing blows. An egg-laying species, Nautolans emerged from their egg as a tadpole that developed arms, legs, and head-tails during their second year of life. Roughly the same size as a Human infant during this time, their limbs were weak and unable to support their weight, forcing youthful Nautolans to remain in aquatic environments for much of their childhood. They stood an average of 1.8 meters, had smooth green, blue, purple, or brown skin, and large black or dark maroon eyes with lids that were seldom used. They were capable of breathing underwater; however, unlike other water-based species, Nautolans did not experience difficulties out of water.\n\nNautolans possessed exceptional olfactory and pheromone-sensing skills, enhanced by head-tresses. These tendrils were used to detect the emotional state of another being, but were most effective underwater. Within Nautolan culture, the ability to sense pheromone changes was an essential part of the communication process. All Nautolans had sixteen sensory tentacles and multiple hearts, which were capable of beating separately. Like their sense of smell, Nautolan language was also maximized for use underwater and not fully pronounceable in a gaseous atmosphere. Because of the loss in linguistic detail, most Nautolans chose to speak Anselmian or Galactic Basic when traveling off-world. In addition, Nautolans used other communicative cues when submerged, such as reading the swirls in other Nautolans' large eyes. \n\nFor more information: https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Nautolan/Legends",

            "content": "The Quarren, were one of several aquatic sentient species from the planet Dac, called Mon Calamari by off-worlders. The Quarren shared their homeworld with the Mon Calamari, another sentient species hailing from Dac. The Quarren had many conflicts and a tense relationship with the Mon Calamari. However, in order to make their planet prosperous, they were forced to provide resources from the ocean depths so that the Mon Calamari could build starships for off-worlders. \n\nQuarren were cephalopodal or cephalopod-like amphibious humanoids with squid-like heads, at least four tentacles on their faces, and leathery skin. Quarren tentacles were prehensile, and they were able to manipulate food with them. Quarren had small mouths, with two fang-like teeth jutting from their faces on either side, and a long, thin tongue sticking out in between. Quarren had two long protrusions that extended from either side of their faces. In these protrusions were several gill-like structures that were actually aural structures, used for hearing instead of ears.[2] Quarren also had holes on either sides of their neck that were most likely used for breathing. Quarren had two sac-like organs that hung from the back of their heads as well.\n\nThe species was also able to change the color of their skin during mating rituals. Most Quarren had orange skin, although some Quarren had gray-green skin; this trait, however, was extremely rare. Pink or purple-skinned Quarren existed, though presumably in small numbers. All Quarren also had two shimmering blue eyes. Being aquatic in nature, Quarren had to keep their skin moist in order to stay alive, although clawed Quarren seemed to need less moisture than other Quarren. The average Quarren lifespan was 79 standard years.\n\nThere were three different types of Quarren, although the only difference lay in their hands. Some Quarren had suction-tipped fingers, either with three or five fingers. Other Quarren had thick fingers that lacked suction cups on the tips of their fingers, yet had sharp claws instead. Whether these three groups were actually distinct subspecies is unknown.\n\nHaving evolved in the depths of Mon Calamari, Quarren could descend to depths of 300 meters without any breathing or pressure apparatus. However, upon ascending from depths of 50 meters or below, a time, equal to the amount that they had spent below 50 meters, would have to be spared, so to as allow their bodies to decompress and thus adjust to the lower surface/water pressure.\n\nFor more information: https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Quarren/Legends",

            "content": "The Gungans were a sentient, amphibious humanoid race native to the terrestrial planet known as Naboo. Prior to the Invasion of Naboo, an event that took place in 32 BBY, the Gungans were a largely isolationist society. They were able to combine machinery with biology. They lived in large bubble-like domes under water. Gungans had strong leg muscles for swimming and were aided by their long fin-like ears. Their somewhat lanky arms ended in four-fingered hands, and their feet had three stubby toes each. Females tended to be slightly smaller with sleeker faces. They often tied their long ears back.\n\nWhile most spacefarers would dismiss Gungans as primitives, they developed an advanced, albeit unique, technology. They grew the basic structures of buildings, vehicles and technology and adorned them with artistic flourishes and organic lines. This gave Gungan technology a very fluid, non-rectilinear look.\n\nThe power source for Gungan technology was a mysterious blue-white energy \"goo\" that was mined in the depths of Naboo's oceans. The viscous plasmic material formed the basis of Gungan weaponry as well.\n\nThe Gungans had mastered energy field technology for a number of uses. Their underwater cities employed hydrostatic fields to create large bubbles of atmosphere within which they dwell. Similarly, Gungan ground troops carried portable frames which generate a protective energy field capable of deflecting blaster fire. In large-scale combat, giant Gungan shield generators could create an immense umbrella of protective shield energy that could stop laser bolts and physical objects with great kinetic energy.\n\nDespite mastering this bizarre technology, Gungans still employed beasts of burden for transportation. Their most common mount was the kaadu, a wingless reptavian which Gungans adorned with feathers and rode into combat. Other favored Gungan mounts included the large, stubborn falumpaset. For truly heavy loads, the Gungans domesticated the fambaa, a nine-meter tall, quadrupedal amphibian.\n\nThe Gungans maintained a large standing-armed force called the Gungan Grand Army. This huge collection of foot soldiers carried cestas, electropoles, and atlatls capable of hurling plasmic energy spheres (or boomers, as Gungans called them). Gungan catapults hurled even larger boomers over great distances.\n\nThe Gungans were ruled by a Boss and his Rep Council from the High Tower Board Room of Otoh Gunga. The Gungans had an uneasy relationship with the Naboo, the human colonists on the planet. Many Naboo looked down upon the Gungans, thinking them as primitive. The Gungans in turn tried to avoid any contact with the surface-dwellers. \n\nFor more information: https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Gungan/Legends",

            "content": "Bith were a peaceful, highly evolved craniopod species native to the planet Clak'dor VII. Fully adapted to a civilized, high-technology lifestyle, Bith were found galaxy-wide at all levels of society, most notably as engineers, scientists, intellectuals, consultants, and musicians. \n\nBith were craniopods with pale pink, red, yellow, or (rarely) green skin, large heads, large lidless eyes, toeless feet, and long fingers with large finger pads and crosshatched fingerprints. Their thumb and small finger were both fully opposable. The Bith's internal systems were different from most humanoids, as the Bith had only one lung, and exhaled through their skin.[9] Bith also lacked a proper nose, instead having highly sensitive olfactory organs hidden in the skin flaps of their cheeks.\n\nThe other Bith senses were also acute. Bith could sense the tonal qualities of sound as well as other races sensed colors.[10] Their eyes, as big as a Menahuun's, were able to focus to 0.07 on the Gandok Scale, and they could see microscopic details of nearby objects, but were extremely nearsighted as a result. An interesting side effect of their incredible sensors was the effect of sonic grenades, or screamers, on them. It was described as causing their heads to explode. Similarly, Bith had high manual dexterity, which helped them manipulate fine tools, though their prowess with gross motor skills was only average.\n\nBith had evolved past the need for sleep. Instead, they would slip into a light meditative trance, which allowed them to get as much rest in four hours as other species could get in eight. During this trance, Bith were still almost fully aware of their surroundings.\n\nA Bith's reproductive organs atrophied over time, as did the portions of their brain governing such impulses. As such, Bith were unable to reproduce naturally, instead relying on artificial conception and gestation. Mates brought genetic material to a Computer Mating Service for analysis against prospective mates. Bith children were created from genetic material from two parents, which was combined, fertilized, and incubated for a year.\n\nFor more information: https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Bith/Legends",

            "content": "The Confederacy of Independent Systems, abbreviated to CIS, and otherwise known as the Separatist Alliance, the Separatist State, the Separatist Confederacy, or simply referred to as the Separatists, was a united galaxy-wide confederacy formed of outlaying star systems from the Galactic Republic, a democratic union, whom the Confederacy had opposed following a period of political turmoil. Established by fallen Jedi Master Count Dooku of the planet Serenno, who served as its Head of State, the Confederacy was founded from a belief of excessive taxation and corruption within the Republic's Galactic Senate, as well as a general feeling of dissatisfaction towards and neglect by the Republic-centric Core Worlds region of the galaxy. Furthermore, the Confederacy was secretly supported by several major galactic corporations which formed the Confederacy's executive council, including the Trade Federation, led by Viceroy Nute Gunray; the Stalgasin hive, led by Archduke Poggle the Lesser; the InterGalactic Banking Clan, headed by Chairman San Hill; the Techno Union, led by Foreman Wat Tambor; the Commerce Guild, led by Presidente Shu Mai; the Corporate Alliance, led by Magistrate Passel Argente; and the Retail Caucus.\n\nIn 24 BBY, a political crisis had begun which led to escalating tensions between the reigning Republic and the rising Confederacy, established in a galaxy-wide secessionist movement orchestrated by Dooku. Many within the Confederacy, including its parliament of senators, had no desire in fighting their adversaries, as they sought to be free of what they saw as the corruption and tyranny of the Republic. However, in 22 BBY, both governments and their respective military forces became enmeshed in the pan-galactic Clone Wars that had erupted on the planet Geonosis, the first major conflict in a millennium.\n\nIn the following three years of the war, which had raged across the entire galaxy on several fronts, the Confederacy made rapid attempts to cease the Republic's influence. However, unknown to the galaxy or either side, the war was a ploy designed by the Dark Lord of the Sith, Darth Sidious, who led both the Confederacy through Dooku as his Sith Master, and, secretly, the Republic as Supreme Chancellor Sheev Palpatine. The Sith Lord had managed to deceive both parties. By the third year of the war, the Confederacy had suffered several major defeats in the Outer Rim Sieges as the conflict began to approach its end, while the CIS lost many starships in the decisive Battle of Coruscant, which also resulted in the death of Dooku. In the days following their defeat at Coruscant, General Grievous was neutralized on the planet Utapau, leading to the collapse of the Separatist leadership, and the fighting effectively coming to an end.\n\nFollowing both the Jedi's demise and rise of the Galactic Empire, Viceroy Nute Gunray and the other surviving leaders gathered on the planet Mustafar with hopes of securing peace with the newly rising Empire ruled by Galactic Emperor Darth Sidious. However he sent his new apprentice Darth Vader to wipe out them and deactivate the Separatist Droid Army as a threat to his Empire.\n\nWith the end of the Clone Wars, the newly-formed Galactic Empire as the successor to the Old Republic, began to dismantle and absorb the former Confederacy of Independent Systems, with only several holdouts daring to resist the Empire, which were suppressed. But an idealized view of the cause persisted during the Imperial Era, with some still holding secessionist tendencies, even into the Galactic Civil War.\n\nFor more information: https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Confederacy_of_Independent_Systems",

            "content": "The Galactic Republic, also known as the Grand Republic or simply as the Republic, was a democratic federal union spread across light-years of space. Old Republic and first Galactic Republic were terms affixed to the pre-modern Republic that existed until 1032 BBY, with the Old Republic also referring to the modern Republic that was supplanted by the Galactic Empire in 19 BBY. In addition, the term High Republic denoted the era in which the Republic reached the zenith of its power, lasting from around 500 BBY to around 100 BBY. The Republic was founded many millennia before the Battle of Yavin, approximately 25,000 BBY, around the same time as the Jedi Order. The Galactic Senate governed the Republic under the Galactic Constitution, and comprised thousands of senators representing the Republic's member worlds. The Supreme Chancellor was the title of the head of the Republic, elected from ranks of the Senate to lead the government on Coruscant. An ecumenopolis or city-covered planet, referred to as Galactic City, Coruscant was the capital of the Republic and therefore the seat of the Senate.\n\nThe Galactic Republic and it star systems shared sovereignty, and spanned a multiplicity of worlds from the Core Worlds to the Outer Rim Territories, uniting a variety of sentient species, human and alien alike, under one banner. As its power grew, the Republic fought many wars against various opponents such as Mandalorians, the Zygerrian Slave Empire, the Nihil, and several Sith Empires. The Jedi Order, a religious group of Force-sensitives dedicated to the light side of the Force, was sworn to the service of the Senate, and as such the Jedi Knights were hailed as the guardians of peace and justice within the Republic. Centuries of conflict culminated in the fall of the Old Republic, and the last war between the ancient Jedi and Sith concluded with the restoration and rise of the modern Galactic Republic, ushering in the Republic Era which was an age of peace that lasted for a thousand years. The Republic's history was officially reset, and the ages before this event were merged into a collective whole known as the Old Republic-era.\n\nThe Republic entered a period of decline after centuries of expansion and prosperity. Aided by the resurgent Sith Lords, the Separatist Crisis divided the galaxy between the Republic loyalists and the Confederacy of Independent Systems. The Grand Army of the Republic was organized under the leadership of Jedi Generals who led the Republic Military against the Separatist Droid Army during the Clone Wars. However, the conflict had been orchestrated to allow Supreme Chancellor Sheev Palpatine—the alter ego of Darth Sidious, the Dark Lord of the Sith—to control and deceive the Republic in a dictatorial manner. With the end of the war, Sidious initiated the Great Jedi Purge through Order 66 and transformed the Republic into the Galactic Empire by declaring himself Galactic Emperor. The Imperial Senate stood as the last remnant of the Old Republic until it was disbanded by the Emperor at the height of the Imperial Era. In the aftermath of the Galactic Civil War, the Alliance to Restore the Republic was fully reorganized into the New Republic, restoring the Galactic Republic after a generation of Imperial rule.\n\nFor more information: https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Galactic_Republic",

            "content": "The Great Jedi Purge (19 BBY—3 BBY), also known as the war against the Jedi, was the sixteen year—long genocide that saw the remnants of the Jedi Order hunted by the Galactic Empire after the initial execution of Order 66, in which clone troopers slaughtered the Jedi upon the Sith Lord Darth Sidious' command. After the Imperial Inquisitorius erased all traces of the Jedi Order they could find from existence and with most survivors having met their demise, their objective was completed and the Jedi were all but extinct, and the Inquisitors themselves seamlessly vanishing as well.\n\nThe genocide against the Jedi traced its origins to the ancient wars between the Jedi and the Sith, who were nearly eliminated around 1032 BBY. The Sith in fact continued operating in secret, plotting their eventual destruction of the Jedi. A millennium after the defeat of the Sith, Darth Sidious, using his public persona of senator and then Supreme Chancellor Sheev Palpatine, manipulated and deceived the galaxy into the Clone Wars as a pretext for gaining emergency executive power over the Galactic Republic. He used the war to manipulate and deceive the Galactic Senate into giving his office virtually unchecked executive power in the name of security. In addition, the clone army that provided the Republic with its military force had secretly been implanted with bio-chips by its Sith creators that, upon activation, would trigger total compliance and force the clones into killing their Jedi leaders.\n\nThe Great Jedi Purge began at the end of the Clone Wars. Anakin Skywalker, a Jedi Knight believed to be the Chosen One destined to destroy the Sith, discovered that Palpatine was Darth Sidious and informed Jedi Master Mace Windu. In what Sidious would publicly label the \"Jedi rebellion,\" Windu and three other Masters confronted the Chancellor, who killed the three Masters and engaged Windu in a lightsaber duel. Skywalker, who sought power from Sidious in order to save his wife, Padmé Amidala, from death, betrayed and incapacitated Windu before the Jedi Master could kill the Sith Lord. Sidious then killed Windu, and Skywalker became the Sith Lord Darth Vader and led the Siege of the Jedi Temple, killing everyone inside it. While Vader carried out the assault, Sidious initiated Order 66, with the latter causing the clones' biochips to brainwash them into betraying and slaughtering the Jedi, ultimately leading to the Jedi Order being destroyed. With the Jedi branded traitors and the Clone Wars at an end, Sidious declared himself Emperor and transformed the Republic into the Galactic Empire.\n\nFor more information: https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Order_66",

It was home to countless sentient species and star systems.\n\nThe galaxy would serve as the setting for trade, politics, and war throughout galactic history.

Coruscant, the galactic capital during the time of the Galactic Republic and subsequent Galactic Empire, was located in the Core Worlds.\n\nCore World design emphasized freedom of customization, which showed in the modular construction techniques of Core-built ships. Citizens from the Core Worlds were stereotyped as being snobs, rich, and speaking with a clipped, practiced accent.\n\nInequalities between the richer Core Worlds and the poorer Outer Rim Territories set the stage for resentments that fed several conflicts throughout the history of the galaxy, including the Clone Wars and the Galactic Civil War.\n\nThe Core Worlds were home to the richest and most important worlds in the galaxy. Densely inhabited and located on the strategic ends of several major trade lanes, its planets were hubs of fashion, education, finance, and technology. It is where the human species arguably began. It was from Coruscant, Corellia, Kuat, Hosnian Prime, and other systems that the fate of the galaxy was often decided.\n\nAn attack on the Core Worlds was virtually inconceivable during the Republic Era; according to the Bith artist Janyor, the \"sense of security and comfort\" created an atmosphere of complacency within the heartland of the Galactic Republic.

The Order was originally established on Ahch-To in the Unknown Regions. In later years, the Jedi Grand Temple on the Core World Coruscant served as the hub of all Jedi activity in the galaxy. The Temple was also a training school for younglings and Padawans, who learned the ways of the Force under the supervision of Jedi Masters, twelve of whom were elected to serve on the Jedi High Council—the Order's highest governing authority. The High Council's staff officers were the Grand Master, who functioned as the leader of the Order and was a title reserved for the wisest Jedi Master, and the Master of the Order, who served as the Council's appointed leader. The Jedi Code governed the Order's way of life; therefore, every Jedi was duty-bound to observe and uphold the Code or else risk expulsion from the Order.\n\nFor more information: https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Jedi_Order",

            "content": "The Force was an energy field created by all life that bound everything in the universe together. It was known by a variety of names throughout galactic history: It was called the Ashla by the Lasats, It by the dianoga Omi, the Life Current by the Mustafarians, the Tide by the Lew'elans, the Sight by the Chiss, the Life Wind by the Zeffonians, the Great Presence by the Pathfinders of the Chaos, the Luminous Mist by the Mist-Weavers, the Unity by the Sorcerers of Tund, and as the Beyond by the Magys and her people. The Force was created by life, and therefore it resided in all life forms. It was especially powerful in a select group of individuals who were born with a high concentration of midi-chlorians—microscopic, intelligent lifeforms that formed a symbiotic relationship with and communicated the will of the Force to their host—in their blood. These people were deemed Force-sensitive, and were capable of consciously sensing the Force. With this conscious sense of the Force came the ability to harness it, allowing Force-sensitives to access various Force powers. Unlike organic beings, droids and other artificial constructs existed outside of the Force. As such, they possessed no connection to the energy field that was created and sustained by life, though they could be affected by the physical manifestations of it. Apart from its scientific aspect, the Force was the basis of various religious organizations, who held differing views as to the nature and purpose of the Force. These included the Church of the Force, the Guardians of the Whills, and most notably the Jedi and Sith Orders. In addition, the Lasats believed that the Force was the \"spirit\" of the galaxy.\n\nThe Force as a recorded concept existed for well over twenty-five thousand years. There were two overarching and symbiotic aspects of the Force. The Living Force was the energy of all life, which, in turn, fed into the Cosmic Force—which bound everything together and communicated the will of the Force through the midi-chlorians. The Jedi followed a code of selflessness and service to others; therefore, they adhered to the light side of the Force, one of two methods of using the all-encompassing energy field. The Jedi's adversaries, the Sith, coveted strength and power through the dark side of the Force. Their opposing philosophies led to millennia of cyclical conflict between the two orders, which resulted in both the extinction of the Sith and the near annihilation of the Jedi.\n\nFor more information: https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/The_Force",

            "content": "The Grand Army of the Republic (GAR), also known as the Great Army of the Republic, the Republic Army, the Grand Army, the Galactic Army, or simply the clone army, was the army branch of the Republic Military throughout the duration of the Clone Wars. At the time of the Battle of Geonosis, the Galactic Republic activated hundreds of thousands of clone troopers to fight the Separatist Droid Army of the Confederacy of Independent Systems. In addition to human clones, all grown from the bounty hunter Jango Fett's genetic template, the GAR also had Jedi and other non-clone leadership as well as regular conscripted soldiers, though they formed the minority of soldiers in the Grand Army.\n\nDuring the waning years of the Republic, Jedi Master Sifo-Dyas contacted the government of Kamino to commission the creation of a clone army, convinced that the galaxy would be consumed by war. As thousands of star systems joined the Separatist movement, the Galactic Senate invested wartime powers in Supreme Chancellor Sheev Palpatine. As a result, the Grand Army of the Republic was formally established, comprising thousands of clone soldiers with millions more being developed in Kaminoan facilities by the start of the Clone Wars. The Jedi Knights, having served as peacekeepers for a thousand years, became Jedi Generals when the Senate called on the Jedi Order to lead the Grand Army against the enemies of the Republic.\n\nFor three years, the Grand Army fought on all fronts across a war-torn galaxy, from the campaigns in the Outer Rim Territories to a Separatist attack on the Republic capital of Coruscant. Through the machinations of Palpatine, revealed to the Jedi as the Sith Lord Darth Sidious, who was behind the war and deceiving both sides, the clones were ultimately forced to turn against their Jedi leaders, slaughtering them throughout the galaxy and inside the Jedi Temple as directed by Order 66. After Sidious declared himself Emperor of the Galactic Empire, the Grand Army of the Republic was absorbed by the New Order and reorganized into the Imperial Army, allowing the remaining clone troopers to serve as the first generation of stormtroopers.\n\nFor more information: https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Grand_Army_of_the_Republic",

            "content": "The Clone Wars (22–19 BBY) was a galaxy-spanning conflict between the Galactic Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems, which had seceded from the Republic. Also referred to as the Clone War, it was named after the clone troopers used by the Grand Army of the Republic against the Separatist Droid Army. With both being fielded in enormous numbers by each respective side, they were the largest military forces in galactic history, and fighting between them swept through the galaxy for three, nearly four, years.\n\nPrior to the conflict, Darth Sidious, under his alter ego Sheev Palpatine, had spent years amassing political power, eventually rising to become the Republic's Supreme Chancellor. Through his Sith apprentice Count Dooku, he sparked the Separatist Crisis, causing thousands of Republic star systems to secede and form a new government as the Confederacy, with Dooku as its Head of State. Beginning with the First Battle of Geonosis, the conflict quickly spread throughout the galaxy with both sides scoring significant victories. At different points in the war it seemed that either side was likely to triumph over the other. At the war's outset, both sides vied for control of major hyperspace lanes to gain strategic advantage.\n\nBattles, skirmishes, raids and other actions continued for the next two years, with notable battles occurring on Ryloth, Felucia, Malastare, and Kamino. During this time, the Separatists developed various super weapons, including more traditional weapons such as the ion cannons of the battleship Malevolence, as well as biological weapons such as a variant of the Blue Shadow Virus. Meanwhile, the Republic launched several key offensives, including the Second Battle of Geonosis, which obliterated Geonosis' battle droid foundries, and a failed Jedi-led operation to capture Supreme Commander of the Droid Army General Grievous at Saleucami. Amidst the escalating conflict, many planets—including Mandalore and other members of the Council of Neutral Systems—struggled to maintain their neutrality, but found it difficult to escape the carnage.\n\nFor more information: https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Clone_Wars",

With a history dating back thousands of years before the rise of the Galactic Empire, the Jedi Knights—noted for their lightsabers and natural ability to harness the powers of the Force—stood as the guardians of peace and justice in the Galactic Republic. The Order was originally established on Ahch-To in the Unknown Regions. In later years, the Jedi Grand Temple on the Core World Coruscant served as the hub of all Jedi activity in the galaxy. The Temple was also a training school for younglings and Padawans, who learned the ways of the Force under the supervision of Jedi Masters, twelve of whom were elected to serve on the Jedi High Council—the Order's highest governing authority. The High Council's staff officers were the Grand Master, who functioned as the leader of the Order and was a title reserved for the wisest Jedi Master, and the Master of the Order, who served as the Council's appointed leader. The Jedi Code governed the Order's way of life; therefore, every Jedi was duty-bound to observe and uphold the Code or else risk expulsion from the Order.",

            "content": "The Force was an energy field created by all life that bound everything in the universe together. It was known by a variety of names throughout galactic history: It was called the Ashla by the Lasats, It by the dianoga Omi, the Life Current by the Mustafarians, the Tide by the Lew'elans, the Sight by the Chiss, the Life Wind by the Zeffonians, the Great Presence by the Pathfinders of the Chaos, the Luminous Mist by the Mist-Weavers, the Unity by the Sorcerers of Tund, and as the Beyond by the Magys and her people. The Force was created by life, and therefore it resided in all life forms. It was especially powerful in a select group of individuals who were born with a high concentration of midi-chlorians—microscopic, intelligent lifeforms that formed a symbiotic relationship with and communicated the will of the Force to their host—in their blood. These people were deemed Force-sensitive, and were capable of consciously sensing the Force. With this conscious sense of the Force came the ability to harness it, allowing Force-sensitives to access various Force powers. Unlike organic beings, droids and other artificial constructs existed outside of the Force. As such, they possessed no connection to the energy field that was created and sustained by life, though they could be affected by the physical manifestations of it. Apart from its scientific aspect, the Force was the basis of various religious organizations, who held differing views as to the nature and purpose of the Force. These included the Church of the Force, the Guardians of the Whills, and most notably the Jedi and Sith Orders. In addition, the Lasats believed that the Force was the \"spirit\" of the galaxy.\n\nThe Force as a recorded concept existed for well over twenty-five thousand years. There were two overarching and symbiotic aspects of the Force. The Living Force was the energy of all life, which, in turn, fed into the Cosmic Force—which bound everything together and communicated the will of the Force through the midi-chlorians. The Jedi followed a code of selflessness and service to others; therefore, they adhered to the light side of the Force, one of two methods of using the all-encompassing energy field. The Jedi's adversaries, the Sith, coveted strength and power through the dark side of the Force. Their opposing philosophies led to millennia of cyclical conflict between the two orders, which resulted in both the extinction of the Sith and the near annihilation of the Jedi.",

At the time of the Battle of Geonosis, the Galactic Republic activated hundreds of thousands of clone troopers to fight the Separatist Droid Army of the Confederacy of Independent Systems. In addition to human clones, all grown from the bounty hunter Jango Fett's genetic template, the GAR also had Jedi and other non-clone leadership as well as regular conscripted soldiers, though they formed the minority of soldiers in the Grand Army.\n\nDuring the waning years of the Republic, Jedi Master Sifo-Dyas contacted the government of Kamino to commission the creation of a clone army, convinced that the galaxy would be consumed by war. As thousands of star systems joined the Separatist movement, the Galactic Senate invested wartime powers in Supreme Chancellor Sheev Palpatine. As a result, the Grand Army of the Republic was formally established, comprising thousands of clone soldiers with millions more being developed in Kaminoan facilities by the start of the Clone Wars. The Jedi Knights, having served as peacekeepers for a thousand years, became Jedi Generals when the Senate called on the Jedi Order to lead the Grand Army against the enemies of the Republic.\n\nFor three years, the Grand Army fought on all fronts across a war-torn galaxy, from the campaigns in the Outer Rim Territories to a Separatist attack on the Republic capital of Coruscant. Through the machinations of Palpatine, revealed to the Jedi as the Sith Lord Darth Sidious, who was behind the war and deceiving both sides, the clones were ultimately forced to turn against their Jedi leaders, slaughtering them throughout the galaxy and inside the Jedi Temple as directed by Order 66. After Sidious declared himself Emperor of the Galactic Empire, the Grand Army of the Republic was absorbed by the New Order and reorganized into the Imperial Army, allowing the remaining clone troopers to serve as the first generation of stormtroopers.",

            "content": "The Venator-class Star Destroyer, also known as the Venator-class cruiser, was a class of more than 1,000 meter-long attack cruiser of the Star Destroyer design family that was operated by the navies of the Galactic Republic and its successor Galactic Empire. Designed by Lira Wessex to feature a double-wedge design and perform a wide range of missions, the Venator was the first class of Star Destroyer to be manufactured by Kuat Drive Yards. Alternatively known as the Republic cruiser, Republic attack cruiser, or Republic Star Destroyer, it was a versatile capital ship capable of serving as both a combatant in ship-to-ship naval warfare and a starfighter carrier, while also being employed as a troop transport, cargo ship, and supply and replenishment vessel. As a warship, Venators were protected by powerful deflector shields and boasted a range of weaponry. For its carrier role, a large flight deck, along with hangars to accommodate a complement of starfighters, gunships, shuttles, armored vehicles and other craft, was contained in the forward section, while three more docking bays were located around the ship. At least two variants existed, the Venator I-class and the Venator II-class.\n\nAs the backbone of the Galactic Republic's naval forces during the Clone Wars, the Venator was commonly employed by the Jedi Generals of the Grand Army of the Republic as their flagships, thus earning the moniker of Jedi cruiser. Deployed across the galaxy against the Confederacy of Independent Systems, Venators saw action in many major engagements, such as the Battle of Christophsis, the Malevolence Campaign, the Battle of Ryloth, and the Second Battle of Geonosis. In the climactic Battle of Coruscant in the waning days of the war, over 1,000 Venators defended the galactic capital Coruscant against a massive Separatist fleet. Eventually, these starships emerged on the victors' side as icons of the conflict.\n\nThe Venator-class Star Destroyer, or Venator-class cruiser, also called the Jedi cruiser, Republic cruiser, Republic attack cruiser, or Republic Star Destroyer, was a type of cruiser-classed Star Destroyer. Designed by Lira Wessex, it cost 59,000,000 credits and was manufactured by Kuat Drive Yards for the naval operations of the Galactic Republic in the Clone Wars. Spanning between 1,137 and 1,155.0 meters in length, 548 meters in wingspan, and 268 meters in height, the Venator was defended by powerful deflector shields and hull armor plating, while possessing an assortment of armaments. It was also equipped with a long-range sensor suite, as well as a navigation computer and corresponding systems. Venator-class vessels generally carried a crew of 7,400 personnel, including officers, pilots and enlisted crew, but could also hold some 2,000 troops in addition. 7,000 metric tons of cargo could be transported aboard the Venator, as well as sufficient consumables to last two standard years.\n\nDuring the early period of the Clone Wars, the Venator-class Star Destroyer featured a wide array of hangar space. The forward section of the Star Destroyer featured a passage measuring 0.5 kilometers down the middle, with bays for starships on either side. It was mainly accessed by large doors on top of the ship. At the fore of this passage, at the bow the ship, was a collection of hyperspace transport rings. Towards the aft of the passage, doors in the floor could open, leading to a space where Republic frigates could dock. If no cruiser was docked, however, the space could be used by personnel to jump out of the Star Destroyer directly onto the battlefield, or to deploy walkers without the need for dropships. Overseeing the passage was a raised command station positioned at the aft. Even further aft, the Venator-class had two independent docking bays on their port and starboard sides, again protected by blast doors. However, in later models, refits were made to incorporate more firepower at the expense of the main hangar.",

During the Clone Wars between the Galactic Republic and Separatist Alliance, the frigates were used by the Republic Navy as a critical component of its war effort. The most common combat configuration was the Pelta-class strike frigate, while other configurations served as hospital ships, such as the Pelta-class Medical Frigate, which was used to safely ferry injured clone troopers to medical stations for treatment. Pelta-class Transport Frigates also served as supply ships to deliver armaments, medical supplies, and food rations.\n\nThe Pelta-class frigate was a model of frigate manufactured by Kuat Drive Yards, measuring 282 meters long and with a crew of 900. It was equipped with a deflector shield generator and a Class 2 hyperdrive. On the aft of the Pelta-class frigate by its engine were two \"wings\" that were able to pivot and open. The rebellion was able to exploit this by adding additional engine units, albeit smaller, to the aft of the vessel. The Pelta-class frigate was also equipped with a docking port on the starboard and port sides near the mid-section of the vessel, and later modifications would alter the door and frame of the docking ports. Alliance modifications also replaced the ramp and cargo bay with a ventral hangar bay that was able to accommodate eight starfighters, including at least five RZ-1 A-wing interceptors. The hangar bay had walkways located above the starfighters to allow pilots to enter their respective starships.",

It was set apart, however, by its three powerful engines (reminiscent of the smaller Consular-class space cruiser), as well as its two forward spars cleaved into the ship's triangular bow.\n\nThe bridge was a small T-shaped command tower positioned atop the hull, flanked by two turret-mounted quad light turbolasers; these were matched by identical emplacements, located on the ventral side. The cruiser's anti-fighter and anti-ship capabilities were bolstered by the quad laser batteries mounted port and starboard. All of the batteries could be retracted into the hull in the case of atmospheric operations. Additionally, the ship also had two pairs of forward ordinance launchers. Its ordinance launchers were typically equipped with concussion missiles, but any standard Republic Navy ordinance could be used.",

The most important difference between the Charger c70 and its predecessor, however, was its combat configuration. Unlike the unarmed Judicial cruiser, the Charger c70 was equipped with four turret-mounted heavy laser cannons (ventral port and starboard and dorsal port and starboard), a forward-mounted twin light laser cannon, and dorsal turret-mounted quad laser cannon. Furthermore, it was outfitted with forward twin concussion missile launchers as well as armored hull plating.\n\nLike the Consular, the Charger c70 had three sublight engines, though it could travel 1,200 kilometers per hour. to the Consular-class's 900 kph. It featured a forward navigational sensor dish, a port and starboard docking ring, a communications and sensor dish towards the stern, and a deflector shield generator, with sturdier models introduced during the retrofit.

According to Luke Skywalker, some combat-outfitted CR90 ships could be equipped with six dual turbolasers. Capable of carrying an entire diplomatic escort, it had a passenger capacity in the hundreds. Although the ships were not built as carriers, three RZ-1 A-wing interceptors could be attached to the docking rings, allowing for a small escort.

            "content": "The Low Altitude Assault Transport/infantry (LAAT/i), also referred to as the Republic Gunship, Republic attack gunship, Assault Gunship or LAATi, and nicknamed a larty,[ was one of the several models in the Low Altitude Assault Transport line of starships that mainly served as gunships and troop transports for the Grand Army of the Republic during the Clone Wars. Its role was to transport Clone troopers as well as offering air-to-ground and air-to-air support for the Galactic Republic against the Confederacy of Independent Systems. The LAAT/i gunship saw extensive use in numerous battles and campaigns of the Clone Wars. During the Imperial Era, the ships continued to see use by various factions, including both the Galactic Empire and Alliance to Restore the Republic.\n\nThe Low Altitude Assault Transport/infantry gunship was a military repulsorcraft. Besides serving as an infantry transport, the LAAT/i gunship was also used to provide air-to-ground and air-to-air support for Republic forces. The front of the gunship had two double cockpit bubbles where the pilot and co-pilot/gunner sat in single file and could be sealed off from the rest of the gunship. A variety of equipment was located in the nose of the craft, including the flight computer and sensors.\n\nThe LAAT/i gunship was armed with a varied mix of complementary weaponry which could unleash considerable firepower. A pair of dorsal mass-driver missile launchers could fire a variety of ordance at up to hypersonic velocities and hit targets hiding over the horizon. These were fed by rear-mounted missile belts which utilized special frictionless material to load the weapons. Four composite-beam laser turrets provided for defense against airborne threats. Each turret had a wide field of rotation, but the composite-beam design allowed for precision aiming beyond a turret's physical rotation. Two of these were mounted in the wings and remotely controlled, while the other two extended out from the craft and were manually controlled by two gunners. Three anti-personnel laser cannon turrets—two mounted in the chin and one in the rear—were useful against infantry and other light ground targets. Each could vary the output on their laser shot to a maximum of five gigajoules. Lastly the gunship could carry eight light air-to-air rockets mounted beneath its wings.\n\nBeneath a surface layer of superficial armor plating, the LAAT/i was equipped with an inner layer of powered, superdispersive armoring which would spread the impact of enemy fire across the entire hull. It could also use its laser turrets to shoot down enemy missiles. When faced with overwhelming enemy fire, the gunship could close its blast shields. In a crash, the LAAT could deploy fire retardant and both the cockpit canopy and side doors could be explosively blown off to allow escape. Additional emergency equipment included medical packs and armor repair kits, collapsible repulsor stretches, inflatable decontamination tents, and a IM-6 Battlefield Medical Droid.\n\nA LAAT/i gunship could carry a full platoon of thirty clone troopers in its main hold. The use of powerful inertial compensators helped troopers to remain standing during their journey. It could also carry up to four speeder bikes. These were deployed from the tail ramp, with the rear laser turret providing covering fire during deployment.\n\nThe gunship's primary repulsor array was located along the bottom of the fuselage; additional altitude-control repulsors were mounted in the wings which, although not designed for aerodynamic lift, also helped to balance the craft. Designed specifically for maneuvering low in a planet's atmosphere, the LAAT/i was at an advantage when dogfighting starfighters below the altitude of mountains as the latter had to sacrifice their considerable speed advantage. While not originally designed for it, LAATs were later modified to allow for short trips in space.",

            "content": "The Low Altitude Assault Transport carrier (LAAT/c), also known as the LAAT/c assault carrier, AT-TE Carrier or the Tank Lifter, was one of the two models in the Low Altitude Assault Transport line of gunship designed to transport a single All Terrain Tactical Enforcer. The ship locked onto an AT-TE with its magnetic claps and brought the walker to the designated drop zone. They were used by the Grand Army of the Republic during the Clone Wars, and by the Galactic Empire as well. They could also carry K79-S80 Imperial Troop Transports and RTT-04 armored troop transports.\n\nThe Low Altitude Assault Transport carrier produced by Rothana Heavy Engineering was a heavy airlift variant of the Grand Army of the Republic's Low Altitude Assault Transport/infantry gunship. Initially designed as a carrier for the All Terrain Tactical Enforcer, the LAAT/c was a fast, lightly armed vehicle used to transport walkers and other heavy vehicles, such as RX-200 Falchion-class assault tanks, to the battlefield for fast deployment. These large, 175,000-credit airspeeders allowed Galactic Republic Army commanders to move and deploy their armored forces quickly and efficiently.\n\nLike the LAAT/i, from which the carrier was derived, the LAAT/c had a long, narrow fuselage with a broad, armored flight deck forward and a pair of high-mounted, downward angled wings mounted aft. Two huge ion engines were mounted in armored nacelles above the wings, which provided the vehicle with a blistering straight-line maximum speed of 620 kilometers per hour and a maximum altitude of 100 kilometers per hour. The troop compartment of the LAAT/i was replaced with modular articulated electromagnetic clamps and other cargo-handling equipment used to carry and deploy vehicles.",

In the aftermath of the war, the Nu-class shuttles were absorbed into the fledgling Imperial Navy. It was the predecessor of the Lambda-class T-4a shuttle. One transport fell into the hands of the Free Ryloth Movement, and was used during the Mission to Ryloth.\n\nDesigned with fold-down wings, it was similar in design to later shuttles like the Theta-class, Lambda-class, and Sentinel-class. Its boarding hatch was at the very front of the shuttle, unlike later variants, which had the cockpit jutting over the hatch. The pilots' chairs lowered into the boarding area for them to enter and exit the cockpit. It also had a magnetic clamp on its ventral side capable of attaching to smaller payloads such as escape pods.\n\nIt was primarily used by the Grand Army of the Republic for missions which required them to operate far away from bases and capital ships. Unlike the Republic's LAAT/i gunship, the Nu-class was also equipped with seats for the passengers due to much longer travel times. Later it was used as a personal transport and shuttle for the Imperial Navy. Notably it transported high ranking individuals such as Wilhuff Tarkin and Royce Hemlock.",

The Dark Lord of the Sith Darth Sidious used the Republic executive shuttle, a variant of the Eta-class, as his personal shuttle.\n\nIntroduced before the outbreak of the Clone Wars between the Galactic Republic and Confederacy of Independent Systems, Cygnus Spaceworks' Eta-class shuttle was study in stylish utility. A relatively small shuttlecraft at 14.2 meters in length, the Eta-class was initially designed for the Republic Ambassadorial Corps and the Galactic Senate as a VIP transport, and cost 100,000 credits. However, with the outbreak of the war on Geonosis, the shuttle were pressed into service by both the Grand Army of the Republic and the Jedi Order. Some were outfitted with three hidden triple light laser cannons and stealth systems for use as black ops ships.\n\nEta-class shuttles could carry ten passengers in comfort, along with their baggage of up to 100 metric tons for capacity and two months worth of consumables. In addition to their cargo, the Eta-class was sold with a pair of on-board folding Undicur-class jumpspeeders. The shuttle was also equipped with short-range sensors and a navigation computer, as well as a Class 2 hyperdrive generator with a Class 12 backup generator, while also boasting a maximum atmospheric speed of 750 kilometers per hour.\n\nFor more information: https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Eta-class_shuttle",

An older design, it saw greater use during the Clone Wars. By the time of the early rebellion against the Galactic Empire, the shuttle cockpit was used in the design of the A/SF-01 B-wing starfighter.\n\nManufactured by the Verpine hives of Slayn & Korpil, the semicircular T-6 shuttle featured a rotating engine block and cockpit that oriented with the rest of the ship when landed or in flight. In its landing configuration, the ship sat horizontally, supported by a trio of landing gear. The cockpit, somewhat conical in shape, remained aligned with the body of the craft, with the three engines likewise horizontally aligned with the body of the shuttle. When entering flight mode, the cockpit and the engine block rotated ninety degrees. The craft had one loading ramp, located on the port side of the engine block. Shuttles of this class featured ejector seats that, when launched, enclosed the being in a flexible, cushioned survival capsule.\n\nDue to its role as an ambassadorial craft, the T-6 shuttle lacked weaponry, but was equipped with a hyperdrive. Furthermore, the craft's spacious interior provided for reasonably comfortable space travel. When pressed into service during the Clone Wars, Republic T-6 shuttles were adorned with a Galactic Roundel and painted in the red-and-white color scheme of the Grand Army of the Republic, though they remained unarmed. Decades later, T-6 shuttles that were a part of the fleet assembled by Lando Calrissian were equipped with aftermarket weaponry added on either side of the cockpit.",

Jointly manufactured by Incom Corporation and Subpro, it continued to see usage into the reign of the Galactic Empire, but was eventually phased out by the newer TIE line, though some found their way into the hands of the Alliance to Restore the Republic.\n\nThe Aggressive ReConnaissance-170 starfighter was a multipurpose starship designed for both intense battle and longer deep-space missions. It measured 12.71 meters in length, contained a hyperdrive, and propelled itself in realspace utilizing two powerful engine systems. It was piloted by a crew of three—a pilot, co-pilot, and tail gunner, along with an astromech droid. Long-range scanners and sensors were contained in the vessel's nose. During battle, the craft's S-foils opened to expose heat sinks and radiators to help cool the ship, and the two main forward medium laser cannons located on the underside of its outer wings were uncommonly large and powerful.\n\nIts laser cannons could punch through a capital ship's armor, and its twin blaster cannons provided a rear-firing arc manned by its tail gunner. Furthermore, proton torpedo launchers increased the craft's usefulness in ship-to-ship combat, and added to its already extensive repertoire in its ability to serve as a bomber. The ARC-170's deflector shields dispersed the heat generated by air resistance in atmospheric flight, enabling the craft to reach hypersonic speeds.",

A mainstay of the Republic Navy during the Clone Wars, BTL-Bs were adopted by clones and Jedi officers alike and were instrumental in the fight against the Confederacy of Independent Systems. Though most were scrapped by the Galactic Empire after the conflict, the BTL-Bs were largely remembered positively and their successors, the BTL-A4 Y-wing assault starfighter/bomber, would see service with the Alliance to Restore the Republic decades later in the Galactic Civil War.\n\nDesigned by Koensayr Manufacturing, the BTL-B Y-wing was intended to serve as a combination starfighter and long-range bomber. The two large Koensayr ion jet engines, along with their characteristic nacelles, were carried by a cross wing, which connected to the cockpit module by a central spar. BTL-Bs were equipped with hyperdrives, unlike many other starfighters. This, along with the fuel recycling system present in all BTLs, made Y-wings durable long-range craft, though their tendency to run hot necessitated a complex cooling system extending throughout the ship.\n\nThe wedge-shape cockpit module carried one pilot and one tailgunner in a rotating bubble turret. These positions were built with clone pilots in mind, though they could be adjusted by mechanics for other operators, including Jedi pilots. The module also featured an astromech socket located directly behind the turret.",

The variant Delta-7B Aethersprite-class light interceptor was also used by the Jedi during the Clone Wars. The Delta-7 would also be used by the Alliance to Restore the Republic in their early campaigns against the Galactic Empire.\n\nManufactured by Kuat Systems Engineering, the Delta-7 Aethersprite-class light interceptor was a Jedi-used starfighter that saw extensive action during the last years of the Galactic Republic, and was designed specifically with the Jedi in mind. The Delta-7's designers worked with the Jedi Order to create a starfighter with fewer internal systems than other starships, and focused on making the controls as responsive as possible due to the Jedi's Force-sensitive capabilities. An elite transport, it could accommodate a single pilot and an integrated astromech droid, as unlike later starfighter models, the wings were too thin for a full astromech socket. Instead, a modified astromech was hardwired into a socket on the vessel's wing, with its dome remaining intact but its components plugged directly into the ships computer. The droid therefore, would play an important part in assisting the pilot with navigation, damage control, and hyperspace travel coordinates.\n\nUnlike most ships in the galaxy, the Delta-7 Jedi starfighter did not feature a built-in hyperdrive, but instead relied on external hyperspace transport rings that attached to the starship, allowing it to enter the trans-dimensional realm. Despite this, the ship could still attain speeds of 1,260 kph in realspace, and was often painted red, the color which represented the diplomatic immunity the Jedi enjoyed.",

The Eta-2 featured wings with upper and lower radiator panels, S-foils, that were opened to shed excess heat from the ship's engines. The radiator wings were primarily opened during intense combat.\n\nThe ship was piloted by a single pilot, with the assistance of a single externally mounted astromech droid for navigation and repair assistance.

Manufactured by Kuat Systems Engineering, the same company that made Jedi starfighters, V-wings were agile and fast, with the ship having a top speed of 52,000 kilometers per hour and maximum acceleration of 5,200G's. Cutting-edge technology was used to give the V-wing maneuverability, and the starship had two vertically placed ion engine thrusters, allowing for surprisingly fast pitch-turnings. Thrusters were placed at the end of the starfighter, but, like a number of ships made for the Republic, the V-wing was too compact to hold a hyperdrive. However, the V-wing did possess a powerful reactor.\n\nTo maximize power for speed and agility, Kuat produced the starfighter without a pressurized cockpit. This required pilots to wear sealed flight suits equipped with life-support systems. This flight suit also allowed a pilot to eject. A single clone trooper pilot flew the ship, and an independent Q7-series astromech droid backed up the clone. This astromech helped in-flight maintenance and navigation. Close to the astromech were two deflector shield heat sinks. Also included in the ship were repulsorlift vanes, at least one reactant tank, shield projector units, the power lines to the shield projectors, and forward sensors.",

The battle station had three spires that each extended from the core of the station from above and below the weapon rings, which were a pair of circular platforms with tracks to allow armaments to rotate to the side of the space station when needed. It was possible that the rings were susceptible to damaged weapons clogging the tracks, but the armament could be ejected in emergency situations. The spires housed more weapons and surveillance equipment.\n\nThe FireStar II-class had a central deck that was surrounded from above and below by the weapon rings, with four hangars for starfighters and freighters on each side. Each corner of the hanger deck extended past the weapon rings and finished in a cluster of thrusters for maneuvering the station. The central levels of the station within the rings were the crew quarters, administration, surveillance systems, and communications.

Also referred to as the Clone War, it was named after the clone troopers used by the Grand Army of the Republic against the Separatist Droid Army. With both being fielded in enormous numbers by each respective side, they were the largest military forces in galactic history, and fighting between them swept through the galaxy for three, nearly four, years.\n\nPrior to the conflict, Darth Sidious, under his alter ego Sheev Palpatine, had spent years amassing political power, eventually rising to become the Republic's Supreme Chancellor. Through his Sith apprentice Count Dooku, he sparked the Separatist Crisis, causing thousands of Republic star systems to secede and form a new government as the Confederacy, with Dooku as its Head of State. Beginning with the First Battle of Geonosis, the conflict quickly spread throughout the galaxy with both sides scoring significant victories. At different points in the war it seemed that either side was likely to triumph over the other. At the war's outset, both sides vied for control of major hyperspace lanes to gain strategic advantage.\n\nBattles, skirmishes, raids and other actions continued for the next two years, with notable battles occurring on Ryloth, Felucia, Malastare, and Kamino. During this time, the Separatists developed various super weapons, including more traditional weapons such as the ion cannons of the battleship Malevolence, as well as biological weapons such as a variant of the Blue Shadow Virus. Meanwhile, the Republic launched several key offensives, including the Second Battle of Geonosis, which obliterated Geonosis' battle droid foundries, and a failed Jedi-led operation to capture Supreme Commander of the Droid Army General Grievous at Saleucami. Amidst the escalating conflict, many planets—including Mandalore and other members of the Council of Neutral Systems—struggled to maintain their neutrality, but found it difficult to escape the carnage.",
