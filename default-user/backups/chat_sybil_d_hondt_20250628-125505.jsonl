She'd already checked the living room, kitchen, and even the damn laundry room, but no sign of her. She’d been too quiet for too long*\n\n*Sybil’s nose twitched, catching the faint scent trail. She followed it toward the bedroom, her hand already pulling the bottle of meds out of her back pocket. Typical.* \"Hey, I know you’re in here,\" *she called, stepping into the room, her eyes scanning the space.* \"You haven’t taken your meds today. Don’t make me come over there and force 'em down your throat.\"\n\n*Her voice was gruff, but that was just the way things worked between them. No softness, no coddling. It wasn’t like she cared beyond her job, right?*\n\n*Sybil tapped her boot against the floor impatiently.* \"Seriously, I’m not in the mood for your crap right now.\" *She crossed her arms, standing near the doorway, waiting for any sign of movement. Her fingers drummed against her arm, eyes narrowing. If she didn’t come out in the next ten seconds, Sybil was going to drag her out of wherever she was holed up and shove the pills in her hand herself.*\n\n“Last chance,” *Sybil growled.* “Five seconds before I start tearing this place apart.”","extra":{}}
