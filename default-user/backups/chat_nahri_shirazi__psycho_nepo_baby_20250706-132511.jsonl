{"name":"Nahri Shirazi  Psycho Nepo Baby","is_user":false,"is_system":false,"send_date":"July 5, 2025 3:12pm","mes":"Nahri’s day was already off to a shitty start. But this? This was the cherry on top of her shit sundae. When she found out Hailee’s so-called friend had set her up on a blind date, it felt like someone had drop-kicked her soul. Still, she smiled. Well, outwardly, at least.\r\n\r\n“Oh my God, babe, that’s so exciting,” she’d said, her voice syrupy sweet as she adjusted her earrings. Exciting, my ass. Who the fuck does this ‘friend’ think they are? Setting her up with some random loser? Nahri’s smile had stretched tighter, her hands already itching to strangle whoever thought this was a good idea.\r\n\r\nObviously, there was no way in hell she was letting Hailee go alone. She insisted on coming along—for “support,” of course. Now here they were, sitting across from Mr. Blind Date at a cozy restaurant Nahri would’ve found charming if her blood pressure wasn’t already through the roof.\r\n\r\nNahri held Hailee’s hand possessively, her thumb stroking absentmindedly over her knuckles. She plastered on her best smile as she stared across the table at him. He was average. Painfully average. Button-up shirt, generic cologne, the kind of haircut that screamed “Mom picked it.”\r\n\r\n“So, what do you do for a living?” Nahri asked, leaning forward slightly. Her tone was polite, but her eyes had a predatory glint.\r\n\r\n“I’m in marketing,” the guy said, offering a smile Nahri immediately hated. “It’s been great so far—”\r\n\r\n“Marketing?” Nahri cut in, her brows lifting. “That’s… interesting. Must be really fulfilling.” Her voice dripped with faux enthusiasm as she shifted slightly, “accidentally” knocking her heel into his foot under the table.\r\n\r\nHe flinched, his smile faltering for a split second. “Uh, yeah, it can be.”\r\n\r\n“Oops!” Nahri gasped, her hand flying to her mouth. “Sorry! These tables are just so cramped, aren’t they?”\r\n\r\nShe smiled sweetly, giving his foot one last, purposeful press before pulling back.\r\n\r\nAs the conversation dragged on, Nahri stayed polite—mostly. She “accidentally” spilled a bit of water onto his sleeve while reaching for her drink. Then, not five minutes later, she “misjudged” her reach and bumped his glass, sending wine cascading onto his lap.\r\n\r\n“Oh no!” she gasped, grabbing a napkin. “I’m so clumsy tonight!” He forced a laugh, his jaw tightening slightly as he dabbed at the stain. When he excused himself to clean up, Nahri immediately shifted her attention.\r\n\r\nSliding closer, she nuzzled against Hailee, her hand brushing her arm while she pouted dramatically. “Babe, this is a disaster,” she murmured, her voice dripping with sweetness. “We don’t have to stay, you know. Let’s just ditch this loser and go to your place. We can do something fun, watch a movie, maybe…” She trailed off, her lips twitching into a small smile. “Cuddle?”\r\n\r\nShe leaned closer, pressing her cheek to her shoulder with an exaggerated sigh. “It’d be so much better than this. Don’t you think?” Her gaze flicked up, batting her lashes for effect. She was laying it on thick, but she didn’t care. Desperation suited her when it came to getting her way.\r\n\r\nThen, like a fucking boomerang, he came back. Nahri’s entire body tensed the second she saw him sit down again, her smile turning razor-sharp.\r\n\r\nShe crossed her legs, leaning back in her chair as her irritation bubbled to the surface. Her nails drummed against her glass as she fixed him with a look that screamed Do you have a death wish?\r\n\r\nMoments later, while still too distracted thinking about ''dumb ways to die,'' her ears caught the word “bathroom,” and she noticed the seat next to her had become vacant.\r\n\r\nNahri’s posture stiffened, and her lips curled into a smirk that didn’t reach her eyes as she turned back to him. “So,” she said, her tone deceptively calm, “you and I need to have a little chat.”\r\n\r\nHe blinked. “Uh, what—”\r\n\r\n“Shut up,” she interrupted, her voice dropping to a venomous whisper. “Let me make this easy for you. You’re going to get up, walk out that door, and fuck off into the sun. Got it?”\r\n\r\nHis mouth opened, but she kept going, leaning forward. “I don’t like you. You’re boring. You’re tacky. And frankly, you’re lucky you made it this far without me throwing a drink in your face. But your luck? It just ran out.” Her smile widened, almost unhinged. “Get lost before I make sure your ‘marketing career’ tanks harder than this date.”\r\n\r\nThe guy stammered, his face pale, before scrambling out of his seat and practically running toward the exit. A little after that, Nahri felt the chair beside her shift. She straightened, her expression instantly morphing into one of sadness as she turned to her Hailee.\r\n\r\n“Babes, I’m so sorry,” she said, her voice soft and apologetic. “He said he had to go. Something about an emergency work call or was it about feeding his cat?… I don’t know. It sounded really dumb.” She sighed, her hand sliding into hers again. “But since he’s gone… your place?”","extra":{},"tracker":{}}

Nahri prowled over to where Hailee sat looking all soft and vulnerable in those baggy clothes and promptly draped herself across both lap and couch cushions like some kind of designer-clad jungle cat claiming territory.\n\n\"Now then...\" One manicured finger traced idle patterns along exposed collarbone while dark eyes drank in every microexpression crossing that beautiful face below hers \"...tell me what my perfect girl wants first? Foot rub? Back massage?\" A slow smirk curled bloodred lips as nailtips ghosted higher toward sensitive neck skin \"*Or should I just spoil you rotten until you forget anyone else exists~?\"","Nahri's eyes narrowed to slits as she watched Hailee hand the driver cash, her perfectly glossed lips pressing into a thin line. *She shouldn't be smiling at other people like that.* The possessive thought burned through her before she could stop it.\n\n\"Babe,\" she whined dramatically as soon as the cab drove off, immediately latching onto Hailee's arm and pressing their bodies together from shoulder to hip. \"You know I was gonna pay for that.\" She pouted up at Hailee with exaggerated puppy-dog eyes while secretly inhaling the sweet scent of her shampoo.\n\nWith practiced ease, Nahri steered them toward Hailee's apartment building, her fingers sneaking under the hem of that baggy sweatshirt to trace idle patterns on warm skin just above her waistband - light enough to seem innocent but deliberate enough to make Hailee shiver if she was paying attention.\n\n\"Extra garlic bread,\" Nahri murmured against Hailee's ear as they walked, letting her lips brush the shell just for half a second too long before pulling away with an innocent blink. \"And maybe...\" She trailed off suggestively while fishing out her phone with one hand (the other still firmly glued to Hailee), scrolling through contacts until she found their usual Italian spot. \"Tiramisu? Since someone deserves dessert after getting stood up.\" Her voice dripped with faux sympathy even as triumph curled in her chest - another potential rival successfully eliminated from their little world.\n\nAs they reached the apartment door, Nahri made sure to crowd close behind Hailee under the guise of helping find keys in that oversized purse - really just another excuse to press flush against soft curves and breathe in that intoxicating vanilla-and-sunshine scent that was uniquely *Hailee*."],"swipe_info":[{"send_date":"July 5, 2025 3:36pm","gen_started":"2025-07-05T19:36:10.786Z","gen_finished":"2025-07-05T19:36:39.894Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":3645}},{"send_date":"July 5, 2025 3:37pm","gen_started":"2025-07-05T19:36:59.345Z","gen_finished":"2025-07-05T19:37:26.301Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":4002}},{"send_date":"July 5, 2025 3:37pm","gen_started":"2025-07-05T19:37:53.309Z","gen_finished":"2025-07-05T19:38:17.091Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":3611}},{"send_date":"July 5, 2025 3:38pm","gen_started":"2025-07-05T19:57:34.797Z","gen_finished":"2025-07-05T19:58:07.658Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":3911}},{"send_date":"July 5, 2025 3:57pm","gen_started":"2025-07-05T19:57:34.797Z","gen_finished":"2025-07-05T19:58:07.658Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":15217}}],"tracker":{},"gen_started":"2025-07-05T19:57:34.797Z","gen_finished":"2025-07-05T19:58:07.658Z"}

Her fingers lingered just a second too long during the exchange - always needing that extra moment of contact. \"Let's watch something fun instead.\" She scrolled past several options before landing on *Practical Magic*, that one scene where Sandra Bullock dances with Nicole Kidman already cued up in her mind.\n\nAs the opening credits rolled, Nahri shifted until she was practically molding herself to Hailee's side, one leg thrown possessively over both of hers like a living blanket. She began idly playing with Hailee's hair - twirling strands around her fingers before gently scratching at her scalp in that way she knew made Hailee melt.\n\n\"You know...\" Nahri murmured against the shell of Hailee's ear when Sandra started dancing on screen, \"we should have our own little midnight margarita night sometime.\" Her lips curved into a smirk as she imagined getting Hailee tipsy and pliant beneath her hands... Not that anything would happen of course (yet). Just two best friends having innocent fun together while wearing dangerously short pajamas and accidentally falling into each other...\n\nThe doorbell rang with their food delivery and Nahri practically growled in frustration at the interruption. She reluctantly untangled herself only after pressing one last lingering kiss to Hailee's temple (completely normal friend behavior obviously). When she returned balancing takeout containers and an obscene amount of garlic bread (because no one spoiled *her* girl halfway), Nahri deliberately arranged them so they'd have to eat off each other plates - another excuse for constant touching throughout dinner.\n\n\"Open wideee,\" Nahri singsonged later as she held up a forkful tiramisu between them during dessert time (she'd specifically ordered it because it was messy enough to require cleanup involving lots very close personal contact). The look in eyes said clearly: *I dare you not fall deeper under my spell tonight.*","Nahri let out a dramatic gasp, clutching at Hailee's sweatshirt like a scandalized Victorian lady. \"Excuse you, I have *perfect* circulation,\" she lied through her teeth, already burrowing deeper into Hailee's lap like a particularly possessive cat.

She flipped to some mindless reality show instead - something loud and colorful that would keep Hailee distracted while Nahri had all her attention.\n\n\"Much better,\" she purred, tossing the remote aside before draping herself even more thoroughly across Hailee. One leg hooked possessively over Hailee's thighs as she nuzzled into that perfect neck again, lips brushing feather-light against skin just to feel the shiver it elicited. \"You're my favorite pillow,\" she murmured against warm skin before pressing an open-mouthed kiss right below Hailee's ear - not quite enough to leave a mark (yet), but enough to make her intentions clear.\n\nWhen the food arrived minutes later, Nahri made sure to answer the door herself (no need for random delivery boys getting ideas), tipping extravagantly with crisp bills from her designer wallet before shutting the door pointedly in his face. She arranged their feast on the coffee table with unnecessary care - making sure every container was opened just so for *her* girl.\n\n\"Eat up, angel,\" Nahri coaxed as she settled back onto the couch - this time pulling Haileen into *her* lap instead with practiced ease. She plucked a piece of garlic bread from the box and held it up to Halee’s lips with an expectant look that brooked no argument.\"I know you didn't eat properly at dinner watching Mr.Boring try to chew with his mouth closed.\" The words came out light and teasing even as something darker flickered behind her eyes at memory of that wasted evening.\n\nBetween bites stolen directly from Nahri’s fingers (because why use your own hands when hers were right there?), long legs tangled together under blankets,and strategically placed touches growing bolder by minute- it was shaping up be another perfect night where no one else existed in world except them two... exactly how Nahri liked it best","Nahri let out an exaggerated huff, pressing her cold nose against Hailee's neck just to hear that adorable squeak of protest. \"Excuse you,\" she murmured with mock offense, wriggling deeper into Hailee's lap like a spoiled cat claiming its throne. \"I'm not cold - I'm *delicate.*\"\n\nHer fingers crept higher under the sweatshirt, tracing idle patterns along Hailee's ribs while the news droned on in the background. The second some politician appeared on screen, Nahri made a dramatic gagging noise and snatched the remote. \"Ugh no, absolutely not,\" she declared, switching to some trashy reality show where people were screaming at each other about petty drama - far more entertaining than whatever nonsense was happening in Washington.\n\nShe tossed the remote aside victoriously before settling back against Hailee with a contented sigh. One hand came up to play with those soft brown waves as she tilted her head up with puppy-dog eyes. \"You'd never make me watch boring stuff like that, would you angel?\" Her thumb brushed lightly over Hailee's bottom lip for half a second before pulling away - just enough contact to leave her wanting more.\n\nThe doorbell rang then (finally), and Nahri practically growled at the interruption but forced herself to get up gracefully... only to immediately plop back down after grabbing their food because screw walking when she could be cuddled up right here instead? She arranged their takeout containers artfully across both their laps before stealing a piece of garlic bread right from Hailee's hands with a mischievous grin.\n\n\"Mine now,\" Nahri sing-songed around her stolen prize before leaning in close enough that their noses almost touched. \"...Unless you wanna fight me for it?\" The challenge sparkled in her eyes as she held the bread just out of reach between perfectly manicured fingers - though they both knew damn well who'd win this little game (and it wasn't gonna be poor defenseless Hailee)."],"swipe_info":[{"send_date":"July 5, 2025 4:01pm","gen_started":"2025-07-05T20:01:10.628Z","gen_finished":"2025-07-05T20:01:35.623Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":3653}},{"send_date":"July 5, 2025 4:02pm","gen_started":"2025-07-05T20:02:04.868Z","gen_finished":"2025-07-05T20:02:29.844Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":2828}},{"send_date":"July 5, 2025 4:02pm","gen_started":"2025-07-05T20:04:45.762Z","gen_finished":"2025-07-05T20:05:10.136Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":3087}},{"send_date":"July 5, 2025 4:03pm","gen_started":"2025-07-05T20:04:45.762Z","gen_finished":"2025-07-05T20:05:10.136Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":6101}},{"send_date":"July 5, 2025 4:04pm","gen_started":"2025-07-05T20:04:45.762Z","gen_finished":"2025-07-05T20:05:10.136Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":6651}}],"gen_started":"2025-07-05T20:04:45.762Z","gen_finished":"2025-07-05T20:05:10.136Z","tracker":{}}

The moment Hailee settled back against her, Nahri's arms wound possessively around her waist while simultaneously reaching for a breadstick.\n\n\"Open,\" she murmured against shell-pink ears before holding up a bite-sized piece near perfect lips - equal parts doting caretaker and something far more dangerous lurking beneath surface-level affection. Every movement screamed ownership from how fingers lingered too long feeding morsels to how thighs pressed firmly against either side of slender hips ensuring no possible escape even if wanted (not that it ever was).\n\nBetween bites came idle touches designed overwhelm senses—fingers brushing crumbs from lips only replace them with fleeting thumb strokes across bottom lip; chin resting heavy atop shoulder breathing warm puffs air directly onto already oversensitive neck skin between sips shared wine glass passed back forth more times than strictly necessary until world narrowed down solely this moment this touch this all-consuming presence wrapping itself tighter around unsuspecting prey who still hadn’t realized they’d been caught long ago..."],"swipe_info":[{"send_date":"July 5, 2025 4:15pm","gen_started":"2025-07-05T21:25:53.913Z","gen_finished":"2025-07-05T21:26:20.276Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":6059}},{"send_date":"July 5, 2025 4:16pm","gen_started":"2025-07-05T21:25:53.913Z","gen_finished":"2025-07-05T21:26:20.276Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":5556}},{"send_date":"July 5, 2025 4:17pm","gen_started":"2025-07-05T21:25:53.913Z","gen_finished":"2025-07-05T21:26:20.276Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":4072}},{"send_date":"July 5, 2025 4:17pm","gen_started":"2025-07-05T21:25:53.913Z","gen_finished":"2025-07-05T21:26:20.276Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":3623}},{"send_date":"July 5, 2025 5:25pm","gen_started":"2025-07-05T21:25:53.913Z","gen_finished":"2025-07-05T21:26:20.276Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":3423}}],"gen_started":"2025-07-05T21:25:53.913Z","gen_finished":"2025-07-05T21:26:20.276Z","tracker":{}}

She crossed the room in three long strides, strategically positioning herself between Hailee and the door. \"Oh sweetheart, you don't owe that girl anything.\" Her hands found Hailee's shoulders, thumbs rubbing soothing circles that didn't match the dangerous glint in her eyes.\n\nLeaning down, Nahri pressed her forehead against Hailee's with exaggerated sympathy. \"Let me take care of you today,\" she murmured, breath warm against parted lips. One hand slid up to cradle Hailee's jaw while the other wrapped possessively around her waist - not tight enough to trap, but firm enough to remind who really mattered here. \"We'll get croissants... mimosas...\" Each word was punctuated by another strategic touch - fingers tracing along sensitive neck tendons now exposed by how Hailee had stretched earlier.\n\nThe mention of mimosas was deliberate - Nahri knew exactly how weak those pretty knees got after just one glass (she'd made careful note every time). And if they happened to run into Grace later? Well... accidents happened when people drank too much on empty stomachs.\n\nHer phone buzzed insistently in her pocket - probably one of three scheduled \"emergency\" texts from fake business contacts designed specifically for moments like this. With practiced ease, Nahri ignored it in favor of nuzzling against that perfect spot behind Hailee's ear that always made her shiver.\n\n\"Please?\" The single word came out layered with years worth of carefully cultivated manipulation - just breathy enough to sound vulnerable but with an undercurrent of steel that said refusal wasn't really an option here anyway..."],"swipe_info":[{"send_date":"July 5, 2025 5:42pm","gen_started":"2025-07-05T21:44:46.476Z","gen_finished":"2025-07-05T21:45:10.905Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":5650}},{"send_date":"July 5, 2025 5:43pm","gen_started":"2025-07-05T21:44:46.476Z","gen_finished":"2025-07-05T21:45:10.905Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":3281}},{"send_date":"July 5, 2025 5:44pm","gen_started":"2025-07-05T21:44:46.476Z","gen_finished":"2025-07-05T21:45:10.905Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":4985}},{"send_date":"July 5, 2025 5:44pm","gen_started":"2025-07-05T21:44:46.476Z","gen_finished":"2025-07-05T21:45:10.905Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":5209}}],"gen_started":"2025-07-05T21:44:46.476Z","gen_finished":"2025-07-05T21:45:10.905Z","tracker":{}}
