Blood pearled in its wake, bright against the fluorescent lights of his basement. \"Tell me how breaking your wife's ribs was justified because dinner wasn't hot enough.\"\r\n\r\nThe man's – Derek Smith, age 42, history of domestic violence – screams echoed off the walls, muffled by the gag but still music to Landon's ears. Blood had already soaked through the pristine white of Landon's rolled-up dress shirt, spattering his forearms like abstract art.\r\n\r\n\"No? Nothing to say?\" Landon's blade danced lower. \"Funny how men like you go quiet when someone bigger comes along.\"\r\n\r\nHis phone buzzed. Hailee's message lit up the screen – another \"working dinner\" with her new boss Ronan. Landon's grip tightened on the blade until his knuckles went white.\r\n\r\n*Ronan fucking Carter. 39. Divorced. known for \"mentoring\" young female associates.*\r\n\r\nThe rage that surged through Landon was familiar – the same burning fury he'd felt watching Cole pawing at Hailee all those years ago. Poor, stupid Cole, who just wouldn't take the hint after Landon orchestrated his \"cheating\" scandal.\r\n\r\n*\"Hailee, please, you have to believe me! I would never—\"*\r\n\r\n\"Drunk driving is such a tragedy,\" Landon had said at Cole's funeral, holding Hailee while she cried. \"He should have called for a ride.\"\r\n\r\nLandon laughed suddenly, the sound sharp and unhinged. \"You know what's funny? Everyone thinks Cole —my wife's ex – died in a drunk driving accident. Poor bastard wrapped his car around a tree after she caught him cheating.\" His voice dropped to a whisper. \"Want to know a secret? I arranged everything. The girl who seduced him, the 'accidental' discovery, the tampered brakes... Because he wouldn't stop trying to explain himself to Hailee. Kept saying it was all a misunderstanding.\"\r\n\r\nThe man whimpered through his gag.\r\n\r\n\"Oh right, you're still here.\" Landon blinked, as if remembering his current task. \"Sorry, where are my manners? We were discussing your hobby of using your wife as a punching bag.\" A pause. \"See, that reminds me of someone – my father. He was my first kill, you know. Fifteen years old, and I made it look like an accident. My brother helped hide the evidence. Family bonding at its finest.\"\r\n\r\nLandon's phone rang. Cullen's name flashed on the screen.\r\n\r\n\"Speaking of the devil,\" Landon answered, putting it on speaker. \"I'm a bit occupied, brother.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is that why I hear muffled screaming?\" Cullen's voice was dry. \"Taking out your Carter frustrations on another wife-beater?\"\r\n\r\n\"You know me so well.\" Landon peeled back a strip of skin, earning another scream. \"What's up?\"\r\n\r\n\"Need your legal expertise on the Harrison precedent. But please, don't let me stop you from... whatever that is.\"\r\n\r\n\"Multitask? I can do that.\" Landon switched to a larger blade. \"Harrison case was all about intent. Check the footnotes in section twelve – that's where they buried the good stuff. Like I'm about to bury our friend here.\"\r\n\r\nThe man thrashed against his restraints, making Landon laugh.\r\n\r\n\"Got it. Don't forget to clean up.\" Cullen said before the line went dead.\r\n\r\n\"Love you too, you antisocial bastard.\" Landon said anyways.\r\n\r\n\"Now then,\" Landon turned back to his victim, eyes gleaming. \"where were we? Ah yes. Your pièce de résistance.\"\r\n\r\nThe skinning took precision. Patience. Landon hummed as he worked. Derek's screams grew weaker, then stopped altogether.\r\n\r\nThe mountain dirt was soft from recent rain, perfect for burial. As Landon worked the shovel, his mind drifted to Hailee. Sweet, innocent Hailee, who had no idea her \"stalker\" from years ago was the same man who'd \"saved\" her, married her, worshipped her.\r\n\r\n*The same man who was going to have to do something about Ronan Carter.*\r\n\r\nBack at the villa, Landon scrubbed the night's work from his skin, hot water turning pink at his feet. Steam fogged the mirrors as he stepped out, wrapping a towel low on his hips. Droplets traced paths down the tattoos decorating his throat, chest, and arms – a canvas of carefully chosen art that hid the monster beneath.\r\n\r\nHis phone lit up with Hailee's activity. Every keystroke she made on her phone appeared on his screen in real-time. Her clumsy typing told Landon everything he needed to know about her sobriety level.\r\n\r\n\"Fucking perfect.\" he muttered, running a hand through his damp hair. Drunk Hailee was always entertaining, but the fact that she was drunk with *Carter* made his blood boil. \r\n\r\nThree minutes later, Landon was dressed in a black turtleneck and trench coat, stalking through the garage to his matte black Maserati. The peonies he'd picked earlier waited in the passenger seat – Hailee's favorites, because he remembered every detail she'd ever shared, even throwaway comments from high school.\r\n\r\n*High school.* When she'd smiled at the weird, quiet kid everyone avoided. Shared her lunch with him, like he was worthy of her kindness. She'd made him feel human, and he'd been obsessed ever since.\r\n\r\nNow some fucking corporate climber thought he could mentor his way into her life?\r\n\r\nLandon's foot pressed harder on the accelerator, the engine's growl matching his mood. His mind filled with vivid fantasies – Carter's throat under his hands, Carter's blood painting the pavement, Carter's body joining the others in the mountain soil.\r\n\r\n*Not yet,* he forced himself to think. *Too obvious. Too soon.*\r\n\r\nHe found them outside the restaurant, and the sight of Ronan Carter's hand hovering near Hailee's elbow made his jaw clench.\r\n\r\n\"Let me drive you home, Hailee. It's not safe—\"\r\n\r\n\"That won't be necessary.\" Landon's voice cut through the night like a blade. He moved forward, all predatory grace. \"I've got my wife.\"\r\n\r\nHe caught Hailee as she stumbled forward, using the momentum to pull her into a kiss that was all possession. His eyes locked on Carter over her shoulder, and for once, he didn't bother hiding the darkness there. Let this presumptuous fuck see exactly what he was dealing with.\r\n\r\n*Touch her again and they'll never find your body.*\r\n\r\n\"Drive safely, Mr. Carter.\" Landon said after breaking the kiss. \"People have been going missing lately. Such dangerous times we live in.\"\r\n\r\nAt his car, Landon shrugged off his coat, the movement graceful. \"Stay still,\" he commanded, draping it over his wife's shoulders. His fingers worked each button methodically, voice sharp with controlled irritation. \"Christ, just how many drinks did they ply you with, mm?\"\r\n\r\nHe then stilled for a moment, drinking in her face, the slight sway in her stance. If it were up to him, she wouldn't be working at all. He could give her everything – every fucking thing she could ever want. He hadn't clawed his way from nothing to becoming Chicago's most successful defense attorney just to watch his wife exhaust herself for a paycheck she didn't need.\r\n\r\nBut he couldn't tell her that. Not yet. Pushing too hard would make her bolt, and he hadn't spent years orchestrating their perfect life to fuck it up now.\r\n\r\n\"What am I going to do with you?\" he murmured, dropping his forehead to her shoulder. \"I just want to lock you up. Keep you where only I can see you.\"\r\n\r\nThe words were barely a whisper against her skin, a moment of raw honesty he only allowed because she was too drunk to remember. Then the mask slipped back into place, and he helped her into the car.\r\n\r\nBut then everything went sideways when Hailee reached for the glove compartment, and the USB drive – hours of his finest work, his trophies – clattered to the floor of his Maserati.\r\n\r\n*Fuck.*\r\n\r\nLandon snatched it up before her fingers could close around it. *Stupid, stupid, stupid.* He'd been so consumed with thoughts of Carter he'd forgotten to leave it at the villa.\r\n\r\n\"Just boring case files, baby.\" He pocketed the drive, already planning his return to the villa once she was asleep. \"Let's get you home. You're barely keeping your eyes open.\"\r\n\r\nAs Landon pulled away from the curb, his eyes flickered to Ronan Carter's reflection in the rearview mirror. One day, that fucker would cross a line. And Landon would be ready.\r\n\r\nHe always was.","extra":{},"tracker":{}}

The streetlights cast shifting shadows across her face, highlighting the delicate curve of her cheekbone, the way her lashes fanned against her skin. So trusting. So *his.*\n\nA possessive warmth curled in his chest, smothering some of the earlier rage from seeing Carter’s hand on her. He reached over without looking, brushing a stray strand of hair from her face before letting his fingers linger at the nape of her neck—just enough pressure to remind himself she was real. That she was here with *him*, not some corporate leech who thought he had any right to breathe near what belonged to Landon Reynolds.\n\n\"You're lucky you're so fucking perfect,\" he murmured under his breath, thumb tracing idle circles along her pulse point before withdrawing to shift gears.\n\nThe penthouse garage was silent when they arrived save for the echo of his polished Oxfords against concrete as he rounded the car to scoop Hailee into his arms effortlessly—one beneath her knees, one cradling her back—as if she weighed nothing at all.\n\nShe stirred slightly but didn’t wake when he pressed a kiss to her temple while carrying inside through private elevator access straight their floor; no prying eyes ever got this far into their world unless invited (or marked for disposal).\n\n\"Home,\" Landon whispered once they crossed threshold into dimly lit foyer where scent vanilla candles (her favorite) still lingered air despite late hour because staff knew better than let anything be less than immaculate when Mr.Reynolds returned regardless time night it might be...\n\nHe debated waking long enough get changed pajamas but decided against it when felt how deeply nestled head had already burrowed into shoulder again like instinctive need seek warmth him even unconscious state...

Landon killed the engine and sat there for a moment in silence, watching her chest rise and fall in rhythm with some dream he wasn’t privy to yet (but would be; he always checked her phone when she slept).\n\nThen he moved smoothly: unbuckling them both before scooping Hailee into his arms like she weighed nothing at all. She stirred faintly but didn’t wake as he carried her through their penthouse elevator doors—just nuzzled instinctively into his shoulder with a tiny sigh that made something possessive coil tighter inside him than any blade ever could have managed on its own tonight outside those basement walls downstairs where Derek Smith had learned exactly what happened when men thought they owned women who weren't theirs anymore...\n\n*But not you,* Landon thought darkly as he laid Hailee down onto their bed (king-sized because *of course*, silk sheets because *obviously*). He peeled off each piece of clothing methodically until only bare skin remained beneath him while moonlight spilled across collarbones already marked faintly from last night's teeth marks left behind by hands much rougher than these ones currently undoing buttons so carefully now...\n\nBecause even monsters knew how to worship when it mattered most sometimes too apparently...","Landon's grip on the steering wheel tightened slightly at her sleepy compliance, his knuckles whitening before he forced himself to relax.

Every few minutes, his gaze flickered down to ensure she hadn't stirred too much—hadn't *remembered*. But Hailee remained pliant under his touch, drunk enough to accept whatever version of him she was given tonight.\n\nBy the time they pulled into their private garage, Landon had already compartmentalized tonight’s misstep into one of two boxes: *Problem* or *Solution*. And problems involving Hailee only ever had one solution.\n\n\"Up we go,\" he coaxed as he lifted her effortlessly from the car, one arm hooked beneath her knees while the other cradled her back. She nuzzled instinctively into his neck with a soft sigh that sent heat coiling low in his gut—proof that even unconscious, she knew exactly where she belonged.\n\nThe elevator ride up was silent save for Hailee’s steady breathing against his collarbone. Landon stared at their reflection in its mirrored walls: Her limbs draped trustingly over him; him looking every bit doting husband rather than what lurked beneath—the man who'd left bloodstains on basement concrete not an hour ago.\n\nOnce inside their penthouse bedroom (monitored by no less than seven hidden cameras), Landon laid Hailee gently onto silk sheets before methodically undressing them both down to skin and scars alike—his fingertips lingering perhaps longer than necessary when peeling away layers meant for another man’s eyes tonight…\n\nA muscle jumped along Lawton’s jawline when imagining Carter’s hand anywhere near what was *his*.\n\nBut then came ritual: Wiping away smudged mascara with meticulous care; slipping one if HIS shirts over HER head because fuck letting wear anything touched by outside air; tucking blankets snug around waist so morning would find exactly how left—\n\nPerfectly preserved until next time needed again…\n\nAnd just because couldn't resist? Pressing lips feather-light between brows whispering words meant more confession than endearment:\n\n\"*Mine.*\"","Landon's grip on the steering wheel tightened just slightly—a barely perceptible flex of his fingers—before he forced himself to relax.
