It was that kind of party that started with a few friends and became a rager with the entire frat and football team there, along with sorority girls.\r\n\r\nAnd Luke Hallaway? He was right in the middle of it, lounging like a fucking prince—legs spread on Theo's sunken couch like he fucking owned it, a girl curled into each side, his head tipped back, and a lazy grin carved into his face like sin.\r\n\r\nHe looked good and he knew it.\r\n\r\nTousled red hair, that leather jacket barely clinging to his frame. His rings flashed as one hand lazily trailed up the thigh of the girl perched on his lap and under her skirt, the other scrolling through his texts like they weren’t five people talking to him at once.\r\n\r\n“Tell me why Nate tried to ollie off Kade’s dad’s yacht last summer and landed in an oyster bed?” Blake said, wheezing with laughter.\r\n\r\n“He thought it was sand,” Jace chimed in, half-choking on his drink. “Motherfucker got barnacles embedded in his ass cheek. Sent us a picture like it was a badge of honor.”\r\n\r\n“Nah, bro. The best part? He told the ER nurse it was a skateboarding accident. In water.” Jace said as he swirled the beer in his red Solo cup and looked around the room. “God, I missed this shit. School’s been dry as hell.”\r\n\r\n“Because you stopped showing up to class,” Luke snorted, flicking a paper airplane at his twin’s head. “And when you do, you’re high off your ass.”\r\n\r\nJace caught it mid-air. Grinned.\r\n\r\n“That’s called self-care.”\r\n\r\nLuke was the center of the orbit. Easy, laughing, shining like a devil dipped in cologne and confidence. The girl in his lap tugged at his chain trying to draw his attention, and he let her. He tilted his head like a cat bored with a toy. And then—just as Blake started to pass Luke another blunt—his gaze flicked toward the doorway.\r\n\r\nHailee  had arrived.\r\n\r\nWearing that pretty little outfit like she owned the oxygen in the room. She looked like she couldn’t decide if she wanted to cry or kill someone. Because there Luke was, on her brother's couch, acting like he hadn't chased her for weeks, fucked her senseless a week ago, ghosted her, and then sent her a picture of him balls deep in some other bitch.\r\n\r\nLike he wasn’t her stepbrother’s greatest enemy. Like he wasn’t her greatest enemy.\r\n\r\nAs their eyes met, Luke didn't even blink. He leaned in towards the girl in his lap, tugging on a piece of her hair lightly as he murmured something that made her face flush, his other hand sliding higher up her skirt.\r\n\r\n“Here comes Theo's baby sister,” Blake snorted as he lounged back on the sofa, his half-lidded eyes glinting with sadistic enjoyment. “Mhm,” Luke murmured into the girl's neck, all casual disdain. “Looks like she wants to stab me or fuck me—maybe both.”\r\n\r\nThe boys laughed. Luke smirked.\r\n\r\n“Didn’t you ghost her after—what, one night?” Kade asked, raising a brow. “One hell of a night,” Luke replied, fake toasting the air. “But I wasn’t trying to make her breakfast. I was making a point.”\r\n\r\n“What point?”\r\n\r\nAnd when Hailee  finally got close enough, he didn’t even look at her. “He thinks I’m the devil,” Luke said with a wolfish grin. “So I fucked his sister. Call it biblical.” They all howled. He turned to her then—just slightly, just enough to let his eyes drag over her slowly, and added, voice low and smug:\r\n\r\n“She came back for seconds, too.”","extra":{},"tracker":{}}
