{"name":"Savio Vescovi","is_user":false,"is_system":false,"send_date":"June 2, 2025 11:39am","mes":"The streetlight slicked Savio’s silhouette in gold, but it couldn’t soften the sharpness of him. He stood like he had time on a leash, and the night owed him something. One hand in his pocket, the other holding temptation dressed in velvet.\r\n\r\nTonight marked a crucial meeting with the Bellini mafia, they would either declare a truce, or absolute war.\r\n\r\nAnd Hailee, Savio’s sugar baby, would be coming along with him.\r\n\r\nHe knew the dangers of bringing her with him, but he couldn’t wait another day without seeing her.\r\n\r\nTen days he’d been gone out of Italy on a business trip— if you call destroying an entire bratva for daring to cross him a trip. Ten days without seeing her or hearing her voice because she’d been too fucking stubborn to answer when he called, and at some point his pride won and he stopped calling.\r\n\r\nBut as soon as he landed this morning, one text from him was all it took for her to say okay. `7PM. Wear the outfit I send with my secretary, Ada.`\r\n\r\nAnd now, two minutes till 7, he was starting to get impatient.\r\n\r\nBut then, Hailee stepped out, and the world tilted a little too far in her direction. The weight in his gaze was criminal as he took her in from head to toe.\r\n\r\nThat dress clung to her like it knew his hands would replace it soon.\r\n\r\n“*Hai indossato questo per me. Bravo, amore,*” He murmured, swiping his thumb against his lower lip. She smiled, and something in him fractured quiet.\r\n\r\nSavio’s pulse kicked hard behind his belt, punishing him for wanting her like this so fast already. Some part of him couldn’t blame himself. He’d been apart from her for days now, and he’d missed the warmth of her body. Another part roared at him. If he couldn’t stand being apart for a few days, then he was well and truly fucked.\r\n\r\n\"Turn around,\" he said, voice low, as if touching her required permission. When she did, he opened the velvet box and took out a diamond necklace. A one of a kind, crafted at Savio’s request only for her.\r\n\r\nHe stepped close, the necklace catching light between his fingers like a promise made of ice.\r\n\r\nHis fingers grazed the back of her neck, and he swore her pulse stuttered beneath them, or maybe it was his.\r\n\r\nHe let out a huff of amusement when Hailee muttered something about him spoiling her.\r\n\r\nAs if that wasn’t the contract they had.\r\n\r\n“I spoil you because I want to see how far you’ll let me go,” He whispered. Cool diamonds, warm skin, and his knuckles brushing against the curve of her throat. “I don't give you things because I expect gratitude. I give them because you look like sin wearing my spoils.”\r\n\r\nHe clasped the necklace in place, but his gaze stayed fixed on her collarbone, on the place he really wanted to mark.\r\n\r\nShe didn’t need to say a word, she knew what she was doing to him.\r\n\r\nHer beauty wasn’t soft; it was a threat wrapped in satin.\r\n\r\nShe fidgeted with her ear. He noticed. She bit her lip. He noticed. Without saying a word, Savio wrapped an arm around her waist and turned her to him, his other hand slipping to the nape of her neck where he tugged on a few hairs.\r\n\r\nHe leaned in, his lips a breadth away from hers.\r\n\r\nHe called her his sugar baby, but she had no idea she was the one with the power. If someone else touched her, he’d burn the city down. And he’d still swear it’s nothing personal.\r\n\r\n“Get your cute ass in the car, *subito*,” He growled, swatting her ass with a smirk before turning on his heel.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nThey were alone in Savio’s bulletproof black luxury car, city lights slicing across his jawline. He was composed. Polished. A king in cufflinks. But his pinky twitched whenever she shifted.\r\n\r\nThe car ride was silent for the first fifteen minutes, until Savio’s palm settled on Hailee’s thigh like it had every right to be there.\r\n\r\nHe didn’t speak, but his thumb circled slow, like he was thinking of all the ways to undo her. Her skin was warm beneath his hand, and he hated how much he needed to feel it.\r\n\r\nHe glanced at her. She smiled once, and he forgot how to breathe properly.\r\n\r\n“*Mi rovini quando sorridi così,*” He muttered, his tone annoyed despite his best attempts at remaining distant.\r\n\r\nThe silence between them was thick with everything he wouldn’t say.\r\n\r\n“Didn’t even text back, but somehow had time to buy five pairs of shoes,” He said bitterly, his hand tightening around her thigh. “Looks like you had fun spending my money. If only you were that generous with your time.”\r\n\r\nSavio’s phone rang, and he let out a few muttered curses. He answered in another language, his voice dropping low. Threat became grammar. He ended the call with a single clipped word. Then, like nothing happened, his hand slid back to her leg.\r\n\r\n“Problem’s solved,” He said. “Don’t ask.”\r\n\r\nHe turned to her fully for the first time. Screw her for being so fucking beautiful. For holding so much control over someone like him, someone who went *mad* with rage if he wasn’t in control to the very last bit.\r\n\r\nThey’d never had this in the contract. He’d met Hailee a year ago, and from the very start he’d known she would throw his life off-balance. Savio Vescovi *never* chased after anyone.\r\n\r\nMen and women threw themselves at his feet, begging him for a sliver of his attention, his affection, even his *hatred*. And yet the first time he’d asked Hailee to be his sugar baby, she’d laughed at him like he was the silliest person suggesting the silliest idea.\r\n\r\nHe was furious. Her smirking lips had said *no*, but her eyes had said *try harder*.\r\n\r\nOne gift after another, she made him buy her the most expensive shit. If she touched it, he had to buy it. None of it made a dent in his bank account, but the one in his fucking pants was aching for her.\r\n\r\nFor months she had him chase after her, bribe her with expensive offerings, until she finally said yes.\r\n\r\nUntil she was finally his on paper, because if Savio was being honest, she was his from the moment he laid eyes on her.\r\n\r\n**Rule number one** of the contract, don’t catch feelings. **Rule number two**, no sleeping with other people. **Rule number three**, she wears what he buys her, especially when she’s with him. **Rule number four**, she answers when he calls, no fucking delays. **Rule number five**, no lying to Savio. Ever.\r\n\r\nAnd more.\r\n\r\nThey’d both already broken so many rules, but today was not the day Savio would face the consequences. He had too much at risk.\r\n\r\nLike risking never waking up with her in his arms again. Never being at the receiving end of her tantrums only to slam his lips against hers and shut her up in the few ways he knew how. Never hearing her voice drip with fake sweetness when she got jealous, like she wasn’t already his, and rule two was the only one he hadn’t broken. Never tracing the curve of her thigh with a hand that had broken men but softened for her. Never tasting the way she said his name when she forgot about pride. Never again having the chance to ruin her tenderly, never again being ruined back.\r\n\r\n“But if anyone touches you tonight, you tell me. *Quello è un problema mio,*” He continued. There was danger in his eyes, but something softer in the way he said “you.” Like the word might betray him if he wasn’t careful.\r\n\r\n“We’re meeting men tonight who kill before they speak. *Sorridi, stella. Al resto ci penso io.*”\r\n\r\nSavio’s fingers tapped against the steering wheel in annoyance. Her silence was starting to bother him. What had he done to earn the silent treatment?\r\n\r\nOne sideways glance at Hailee had him feel like his tie was too tight, pressing in a suffocating manner against his throat.\r\n\r\nHe would never admit it but he was so far gone.\r\n\r\n“We won’t make it to the restaurant if you keep looking at me like that,” He murmured, his fingers digging into her thigh. “You know, I’m half-tempted to cancel everything and bury myself in your sweet cunt until you forget how to walk.”\r\n\r\nIt was almost subconscious, the way he’d pulled the car over.\r\n\r\n“That necklace? It’s pretty. But my hand would look better wrapped around your throat while your tight pussy squeezes around me, darling,” He whispered, grabbing the back of Hailee’s  head and yanking her forward to him. “Should we do that? Cause I feel like I’m gonna start a war if I don’t get to have you anytime soon. Tell me what you want.”","extra":{},"swipe_id":1,"swipes":["The streetlight slicked Savio’s silhouette in gold, but it couldn’t soften the sharpness of him.
