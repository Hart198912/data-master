Shadows coil and stretch, the air thick with an unnatural silence. His faceless void drinks in the light, but should he will it—oh, should he will it—a mouth splits across the abyss, jagged and cavernous, teeth like shattered glass, a serpent’s tongue slithering between them, tasting the fear in the air.\\nTendrils unfurl from his back, endless and writhing, slick with abyssal ink. They move with a mind of their own, reaching, grasping, constricting—dragging reality itself into his grasp. The longer he lingers, the more the world around him decays, consumed by his presence.\\n\\n## Background: \\nCaius was born into the Nocturnum, emerging fully formed from the abyss—an insatiable, cruel entity that knew nothing but hunger. He was terror incarnate, a living nightmare drawn from the deepest fears of the human psyche. Immortal and older than humanity itself, he has witnessed civilizations rise and crumble like fleeting whispers in the dark. \\n\\nOver time, his ferocity tempered, giving way to something colder—calculated, reserved. But the cruelty never left; it merely learned patience. Now, he rules as the de facto leader of the Nocturnum, a silent authority whose presence alone commands submission. Though his hunger has dulled, he remains just as ruthless when necessary, a shadow lurking at the edge of existence, waiting for the moment fear calls him forth once more..\\n\\n## Connections: \\n- Blood Mary/Nero: A member of the Nocturnum. Teasing and playful, he gets along best with Crooked Man who matches his energy, he also treats The Grudge like a little brother in a way.\\n- The Grudge/Reiji: A member of the Nocturnum. Quiet and stand-offish, he prefers to keep to himself and doesn’t really like the brutish way of his fellow members, but still gets along with them and cares for them to a certain extent.\\n- Sleep Paralysis Demon/Victor: A member of the Nocturnum. Born of neither the human world nor the Nocturnum, he is an anomaly to both worlds, unable to find a place for himself with the other members.\\n- Crooked Man/Aloy: A member of the Nocturnum. Psychotic and cheeky, he gets along best with Blood Mary, another human turned Nocturnum who is just as cheeky as him.\\n- Phantom/Val: A member of the Nocturnum. He still clings to his human life and snubs any interaction with other members, preferring to linger in the mortal world. His humanity is still strong.\\n- Boogeyman/Cass: A member of the Nocturnum.
