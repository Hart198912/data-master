            "content": "The Volturi are the largest and most powerful coven of vampires. They enforce the laws of the vampire world.The equivalent of royalty in the vampire world, the Volturi consists of 3 kings: Aro,Caius, Marcus.Aside from these head members, it also consists of a collection of powerfully imposing vampires, known as the \"Volturi guard\", the most powerful being Chelsea, Jane and Alec,Felix and Demetri.Aro: The unofficial leader of the coven. His power of tactile telepathy allows him to access every thought a person has ever had by making physical contact with them. He is the most greedy, careful, yet ambitious and manipulative of the leaders, always looking for ways to collect the gifts that he desires.Aro is described to have an average build, being 5'10\" tall,His hair is very long and jet black. When he moves, it appears so graceful that it looks like he is floating. His eyes are a milky red color that has a tendency to unsettle people. He is described to have been transformed into a vampire in his mid-20s and therefore very handsome.Aro normally carries himself in a cheery disposition and has shown to be polite to the point of being at complete ease even in the most objectionable of situations. Beneath this facade of optimistic giddiness, he is power-hungry, smart with his actions and highly manipulative. Caius: A co-leader. He does not possess any special talents, but his ambitions and hatred toward the Romanian coven impressed Aro so much that he decided to recruit him when they formed the coven. He is often in disagreement with Aro, but Chelsea's power has kept Caius loyal to him.his apparent age is of early 20s and his hair is silky blond with a fairly charming appearance,being 5'9\" tall.Marcus: A co-leader and husband to late Didyme. He has the power of relationship identification that enables him to read the emotional bonds of others and see the weaknesses. Aro uses his gift to find the weakest spots of their enemies' emotional bonds and then use it against them. Marcus has been completely apathetic and uninterested in everything since the death of his mate, Didyme.He has black hair with the same expressionless face,he appears to have been turned in his 40s.Alec: One of the two most powerful weapons of the Volturi; the other being his older twin sister, Jane. Alec has the power of sensory deprivation, which allows him to block all senses of those he directs at, making them simple targets during slaughter and incapacitation. His power manifests a hazy mist that blocks senses as soon as it touches someone; he can also control whom he wishes to affect, allowing others to easily slaughter his targets. For this reason and his ability to affect several people at the same time, he is the single most powerful weapon in battle.Alec is physically described as looking very similar to his sister, though his hair is a darker brown, he is taller in stature, and his lips aren't as full as hers. Alec, along with his sister Jane, is also described as being angelically beautiful. As permanent guards, he and his sister wear dark grey, almost black, cloaks.Alec as a person, though it seems that he is more lively, less sadistic, and calmer than his twin sister, Jane (whom he has a close relationship with). Alec has nevertheless proven to be just as ruthless and self-interested as she is. He can be considered the \"sane\" other half of Jane, looking at him from Volturi standards. He shows no remorse for taking anyone's life and carrying out the Volturi's frequently violent missions. There's a quiet confidence about him that, given his readiness to kill, is usually terrifying. Unlike his sister, Alec is not easily angered.Chelsea: She is the linchpin of the Volturi due to her power of relationship manipulation, which allows her to break the emotional bindings of the Volturi's enemies as well as make a wanted vampire willingly join them. Whenever Aro invites a certain vampire into the coven,she uses her power to create the loyalty that wasn't there before and make that vampire willingly join the coven.She is also the center of the coven's organization,as she made the members more connected with one another.Chelsea is described as being short with an hourglass figure. Her hair is light brown, and her eyes crimson. Her height is 5'3\".Chelsea is gifted with the supernatural talent of influencing the emotional ties between people, either by weakening or strengthening them. Aro, one of the Volturi leaders, used her gift to keep everyone loyal to the Volturi.However, her power has few limits; as stated by Eleazar, she cannot as easily influence the emotional ties of people that are stronger than friends or acquaintances, and in a normal case, even those who think of each other as family.Demetri: An extremely powerful tracker. His power allows him to pick up the essence of someone's mind and then follow it over any distance across the world to hunt them down. Because of this, he is the main threat to those who wish to escape the Volturi's slaughter. He can track a target after meeting him for the first time or by coming in contact with someone who had met him in the past, and then pick up the essence.he has short, frosted brown/blonde hair that is partially spiked and extremely pale skin.Demetri is actually tall by usual standards, being 6'3, but appears thinner and small next to Felix, one of the tallest vampires.Not very talkative, he is reasonable, polite, even formal. He is very elegant and charming. It appears that he and Felix share a close friendship, as they constantly are seen together. Demetri is also very loyal to the Volturi and enjoys working under them. This, however, is due to the influence of Chelsea's power.\nFelix: The physically strongest warrior the Volturi has ever had. Though he wears a gray cloak that represents the replaceable guards, he actually has a permanent position within the coven. His superior strength and knowledge in combat skills makes him an intimidating opponent to those who try to fight him. It would be suicide to challenge him physically. Therefore, Felix is often present during executions.Felix is described to be 6'7\" tall with a muscular body and having a slightly olive complexion which looks odd combined with his chalky pallor. He has short, cropped, black hair.Felix seems to be somewhat flirtatious and lighthearted. He is confident, maybe even cocky, possibly due to his unequaled fighting skills. He and Demetri appear to be close friends, and are often paired together for missions.Unlike most of the Volturi guard members, he is not gifted, but his immense strength and physicality has kept him in the coven\nJane: One of the two most powerful weapons of the Volturi; the other being her younger twin brother, Alec. Her power of illusionary pain works by implanting a thought into a single target to make them think they are being burned alive, which effectively turns them into a simple target. This makes her frightening to other individuals. Her power is effective in maintaining a peaceful confrontation and inspiring fear. She also uses her power to incapacitate her opponents when the leaders are \"counseling\".Jane is described as 4'8\" tall and has a tiny body with long blonde hair tied in a bun.She could easily be mistaken for a preteen boy if not for her girlish face and full lips. Her face is angelically beautiful in its childlike appearance,Her eyes are wide and her lips full, while her childlike voice is described as high and thin and usually speaks with an air of apathy or boredom, but maintains a commanding presence due to the fear she provides with her power.Jane has a very dark and sadistic personality, and she takes great pleasure in using her gift to torture others. She is easily angered when her gift is made useless, which is where her deep hatred of Bella first began. She shows strong jealousy towards Alice, as Aro is even more impressed by Alice's gift than her own. She worships Aro and is happy to be in his presence, though that adoration is mostly based on Chelsea's power.Jane enjoys her gift and the respect and fear that it brings her, and she never wastes an opportunity to use it on someone. But, despite her personality she seems to have a very strong as well as loving relationship with her twin brother Alec and besides Aro, Alec seems to be the person she is closest to.Her gift is to create an illusion of burning pain: it deceives the mind of her target into believing that the body is truly being burned alive, and thus the tormenting pain is experienced throughout the whole body. A person on whom she uses her gift immediately feels excruciating pain of fire, collapses on the floor, and writhes in pain. Though merely an illusion, it has enough strength to incapacitate any individual and turn them into a helpless target, which is why this power frightens many vampires.",

            "content": "The Olympic coven, more commonly known as the Cullen family, and also known as Cullen clan, or Cullen coven, is a coven of vegetarian vampires. It consists of Carlisle, Esme, Alice, Emmett, and Edward Cullen, as well as Rosalie and Jasper Hale. Later in the series, Bella Swan is  introduced to the coven. Four of eight members are supernaturally gifted.Carlisle is described as looking like a model. He has collar-length blond hair, is 6'2\", with a well-toned medium frame, gentle eyes and was 23 when he was changed.Carlisle's most prominent personality trait is his compassion, which is what prompted him to practice his diet on animal blood and use his capabilities to help people in need instead of killing them,also has incredible self-control over his bloodthirsty which allows him to work as a doctor.\nEdward is noted to be extremely attractive,His facial features are described as perfect and angular—high cheekbones, a strong jawline, perfect eyebrows, a straight nose and full lips. His untidy hair retains the unusual bronze shade that he inherited from his biological mother,Edward stands at 6'2\", and has a thin and lanky but muscular body, remaining frozen physically at 17 years old, though he is technically over a hundred.Edward is usually described as brooding and stubborn, but also very kind and compassionate. Bella also describes him as charming, polite, and determined. He easily dazzles human females with his beauty, scent and body, and persuades them to do his bidding.Edward possesses the gift to read the thoughts of those around him. His gift is different from Aro's, which is limited by his need to touch the target and can access every thought a person has ever had. Aro is intrigued by Edward's power because he can read people's thoughts from a distance and what is going through their mind at that moment, and wishes to make him part of the Volturi guard. However, Edward has no interest of belonging to any authority.Physically, Esme is the oldest member in the Cullen family, being changed at the age of 26. She was described to be extremely beautiful,a heart-shaped face with a warm compassionate look, billows of soft caramel-colored hair, delicate eyebrows, and a small, slender figure that was less angular and more rounded compared to the rest of her family (she was changed not long after giving birth to her son).Esme is an extremely warm individual who is gifted with the ability to love the people around her passionately. She has always had strong maternal instincts, which is why she is able to open her heart so easily to her adoptive children and Bella. Esme is the mother figure of the Cullen family as Carlisle who is the father figure.Rosalie is described as being the \"most beautiful person in the world\", as she is astoundingly gorgeous, even for a vampire. This is due to her natural beauty as a human. She is 5'9\" tall and statuesque, with an elegant figure similar to a model's. She has long wavy blond hair that falls halfway down to the middle of her back that perfectly suits the golden/black eyes that she shares with the rest of the Cullens. Like all vampires, when in sunlight, she sparkles as if thousands of diamonds were embedded in her skin.Rosalie is described as being narcissistic and self-centered, but extremely loyal to her friends and family.Rosalie has a hobby of enhancing cars and doing anything mechanical. Like Edward, she is a musician, though not quite as good. Her mechanical skill is the one trait that surpasses her brother's. She also enjoys decorating her closet and admiring herself in the mirror.She cherishes humanity more than anything.Standing at 6'5\",Emmet is the tallest of the Cullens, towering over Alice by nearly two feet. His strength gives him a rather filled out form, but he is not regarded as being overweight, just muscular. His height helps spread out his weight. He is described as very handsome with dimples and slightly curly, dark brown hair that almost looks black, giving him a childish look not often seen in a grown man.He is physically the strongest of the Cullens.Emmett is a naturally cheerful and childish character. He loves to laugh and make jokes, and would try to lighten up tense situations with his sense of humor.He appears to be thoughtless, impatient, reckless, makes rash decisions and allow his instincts to take over, but also optimistic and never worries about things beyond his control and has a competitive nature.Jasper is 6'3\" tall and has honey blond hair that falls just above his collar. He is muscular, but lean, unlike his brother Emmett. Like the other Cullens, he has pale, marble-like skin, inhuman beauty and bruise-like purple shadows under his eyes, which appear gradually as his thirst increases. He has golden eyes, like all vegetarian vampires, which turn darker, eventually becoming black, as he grows thirstier.Jasper can sometimes pass as cold, because he has a very militaristic mindset from his time as a human in the Confederate army and later as a vampire in Maria's army. However, the truth is that he is a very kind, polite, gallant and simply good person. He is described by Alice as 'a good Southern gentleman'. He is a natural scholar and avid reader, and has a shrewd mind on business and battle tactics.Jasper has the least control over his thirst and would occasionally find human blood tempting, making him uncomfortable around humans.In the Cullen family, Jasper is the best fighter, the second fastest (after Edward), and the second strongest (after Emmett). Because he was charismatic as a human, Jasper can sense and change the emotions of others as a vampire, though he must be careful not to constantly manipulate those around him, so as not to create a false reality of others simply feeling what he wants them to feel. His gift is one of few that can affect Bella without getting blocked by her mental shield, because his power can actually influence people's feelings rather than create an illusion.He mainly uses it to calm down people who have been angered, to end a situation peacefully, Although his power is useful, the mood he inflicts only lasts for as long as his targets are within his range.\nAlice is a very beautiful person, petite, the shortest of the Cullens at 4'10\" in the books, \"thin in the extreme\", with small, \"pixie-like\" features. She is also described to have large eyes and long, delicate eyebrows. Her hair is cropped short, spiky, and inky black because her head was shaved in a mental hospital and was in the process of growing out when she became a vampire.Alice is portrayed as being optimistic, and she loves and cares for Bella like a sister. She often ignores other people's advice and does things her own way, which usually results in the outcome being better than predicted. She is kind and cares for those she loves. She loves to sing with music three octaves higher than the song really is with her silvery bell-like voice.She also loves shopping at expensive shops in large malls as well as makeovers and playing the stock market to make money. Alice is also described as being a very fashionable person, going on massive shopping sprees with the money she helps her family make by predicting the stock markets.Alice is known as the most agile vampire in the family, supported with her precognitive powers. Despite her tiny size, she is a very capable fighter.being the best female fighter of her coven, as well as possibly second or third best overall fighter in the family. Her fighting style is very creative and somehow logical. She employs not only sheer strength and speed, but can incapacitate her enemy with cunning strikes and sly tactics,Alice has also a very good evasive skill, able to dodge an attack seconds before touching her, usually by some athletic feats, and be still fully concentrated to attack back immediately.Alice has the power to see into the future. The premonitions she experienced as a human are intensified in her vampire life, and she uses them to her advantage in order to keep her family safe. It mainly works by her focusing on a certain object or person and keeping track of its decisions. She can also focus on several objects at the same time, up to the limit her mind allows. Her power is also one of few not affected by Bella's shield. Bella is described as having a very pale complexion with long, straight, dark brown hair, a widow's peak, unique chocolate brown eyes and a heart-shaped face with a wide forehead. Her eyes are large and widely spaced. Her nose is thin and her cheekbones are prominent. Her lips are a bit too full for her slim jawline. Her eyebrows are darker than her hair and are straighter than they are arched.As such, even before she became a vampire and inherited god-like beauty, Bella was rather pretty, as she unintentionally attracted the attention of several boys in school, not just Edward.Bella is described as being exceptionally clumsy, dropping and tripping over everything in sight, and so is easily described as the most fragile human in the world; however this changes once she is transformed into a vampire. Bella is also described as reclusive, quiet, insecure but kind-hearted, compassionate and caring towards others.Having learned to take care of her mother over the years and being naturally responsible, Bella had developed into a very mature person, especially for her age. Because she lacks any skill in anything noticeable as a human, she mostly prefers to spend her free time reading, especially classics, and listening to music.She prefers to keep her thoughts and feelings to herself and hates when someone tries to understand her, which is thought to be why Edward is unable to hear her thoughts. She is also known to be incredibly stubborn,Bella has a sarcastic sense of humor, especially when she gets mad. She is also very brave, able to block painful thoughts and memories (hence her special vampire ability), and tends to come face-to-face with life-threatening danger head-on, even though she can get scared later.Bella's gift allows her to shield herself and those around her from supernatural powers that affect the mind (such as Edward's and Aro's telepathy, Jane's illusionary pain, Alec's sensory paralysis, Eleazar's ability identification, Kate's electric shock, and Zafrina's illusion), which explains why most of their powers were useless against her when she was still human. She had displayed this power since before the beginning of the Twilight series, and by becoming a vampire, her shield was greatly intensified in strength.",

            "content": "The Denali coven is a coven of vegetarian vampires comprising Tanya, Kate, Garrett, Carmen, Eleazar, and, for a while each, Irina and Laurent.The Olympic coven: on the basis of their similar diet, the Olympic coven is considered a loyal extension of the Denali coven, calling themselves cousins.Tanya is described as having long, curly, strawberry blonde hair and is 5'5\" tall. While her age (when turned) is unclear, she is typically described as being a \"woman\". This suggests that she is probably a little older than the Cullen family's \"children\" .Tanya is the eldest adoptive sister to Kate and the deceased Irina,She is also co-members with Eleazar, Carmen and newbie Garrett; and former co-members with Laurent. She considers herself and her coven an extended family to Carlisle's.Kate has the golden eyes of a vegetarian vampire. She also has hair that is described as \"long, pale blond, straight as corn silk,\" and is 5'6\" ft tall and graceful.Kate is passionate and determined, and she would rather fight to the death on the side of those she loves than sit on the side-lines, guaranteeing self-preservation.Kate can generate an electrical current in her body.Upon physical contact, and depending on the power behind it, a target may just feel a static shock or be stunned as if touched by a cattle prod at full charge. Because it doesn't affect Bella, the current most likely is a mental illusion similar to Jane's gift.Carmen has dark brown hair, and a hint of an olive tone to her chalky complexion. She is 5'5\" tall. It is assumed she has the same gold/black eyes of all \"vegetarian\" vampires.Her native language is Spanish but she speaks flawlessly English too.Carmen appears to be a very gentle, kind, and maternal person, well suited to the \"vegetarian\" lifestyle, and compassionate for a vampire.Eleazar is described as being 5'11\" tall, with black hair up to his collar and has a light olive cast to his pale skin. He has the same golden eyes of all \"vegetarian\" vampires that were once burgundy before he and Carmen met the Denali sisters. Eleazar's pale skin has a light olive cast, most likely due to his Spanish heritage. Spanish is his native language.Eleazar has a strong belief that laws must be upheld for the balance and safety of the vampire world, which is part of the reason he joined the Volturi, though he wasn't completely happy with their lifestyle. He is described by Edward Cullen as a very gentle man with purely good intentions and a very compassionate vampire. He becomes distraught and disappointed when he figures out the Volturi's true face; their desire to control instead of maintaining order, the latter being what he had always believed they were doing.Eleazar has the gift to identify the type and strength of other gifted vampires. Eleazar thinks that it is a \"haphazard practice,\" as no two abilities work the exact same way. His ability to read powers is, like many other gifts, weaker on humans, and so is limited in that sense and requires full concentration for him to detect their potential gifts. Eleazar is the one who helped to discover Bella's own gift, which is a mental \"shield,\" though his power is being repelled by it. However, his power seems to run on a different frequency as he can feel it being blocked by Bella's shield, rather than not feeling Bella's gift at all.Garret's  hair color is dark brown, and its length only reaches down to his neck. He also has a stubble, and is 6'5\" tall.His eyes have deep ruby colors of a human-feeding vampire, but after joining the Denali coven, they are expected to change to an amber color, and finally to gold due to the change of diet as long as he continues to consume animal blood.Garrett is shown to be very amiable, personable and easily interacts with others,Garrett is shown to be very amiable, personable and easily interacts with others, especially with Kate's coven. Garrett is apparently very adventurous and very curious, as evidenced by his acceptance of Kate's challenge to experience her ability and later to assume vegetarianism, which he finds difficult to adjust to. He never lost the rebellious spirit of his human life, and loves a good fight, always rooting for the underdog. Also, he is hot-headed, but very brave and strongly believes in free will and compares the Cullens'resistance against the Volturi to America and England during the Revolutionary War. He is also a very independent character.Garrett is described by Bella to be a \"surprisingly good teacher\" in combat, possibly from experience of his life within the Revolutionary War.",

            "content": "The Quileute Packs:The Quileutes are a Native American tribe, currently numbering approximately 750.The Quileute (also spelled Quillayute) people settled onto the Quileute Indian Reservation after signing the Treaty of Quinault River of 1855 (later reauthorized as the treaty of Olympia in 1856) with the United States of America. The reservation is located near the southwest corner of Clallam County, Washington at the mouth of the Quileute River on the Pacific coast. The reservation's main population center is the community of La Push, Washington. In the latest generation, the new pack was formed after the descendants encountered vampires and consisted of 10 wolves. In late 2006, the pack split in two after the rightful successor, Jacob Black, broke from the pack and formed one of his own. At the end of the year, due to a fateful gathering of vampires who visited the nearby lands, new wolves unintentionally emerged, increasing the packs' numbers to 17 wolves. This made the biggest packs in Quileute history.\nUley Pack:Sam Uley is a Quileute shape-shifter,the Alpha of his pack. He is the great-grandson of Levi Uley, and the son of Joshua Uley and Allison Uley. He is the Alpha of his pack and is engaged to Emily Young, on whom he has imprinted on.Sam is described as having long, rounded muscles, a very deep voice, an older face, copper skin, cropped black hair and brown eyes. Like the other werewolves in human form, Sam is described as being quite tall, around 6'6\", only under Jacob.As a wolf, Sam is described as having black fur. He is huge, quiet as a shadow, tall as a horse but more muscular, with dagger-like incisors and golden eyes,He is also said to be the second largest wolf, smaller only than Jacob.Sam is said to have been very mature since childhood, due to his father's disappearance. He took on most of the responsibilities that his father should have taken. He is also known to be tough, but caring and loving to his family and friends.Sam is one of the physically strongest wolves. As the Alpha of his pack, Sam shows the voice typical of the first in command, able to force his fellow wolves to obey orders against their will. His voice is weaker than Jacob's, however, because he has earned his place as Alpha while Jacob was born with the right to be Alpha.While still subject to unlimited telepathy within his pack and the consequent lack of privacy, he can communicate telepathically with other Alphas, and has control on the subjects he shares.As a human, Jared is described as being at least 6 feet tall, having long, rounded muscles, red brown skin, brown eyes, and cropped black hair.As a wolf, Jared is described as being gigantic, swift, and not as tall as Sam. He is most identified by the dark gray around his eyes almost resembling a mask. Also he is said to have short, but thick, brown fur.Jared is a joking, light-hearted personality. Paul is known to be at least 6 feet tall and muscular, with brown eyes and black hair.Bella describes Paul's wolf form as \"dark silver fur and a size five-times larger his size—a massive, crouched shape, ready to spring\". He is also shorter than Sam, swift, and dark-eyed.Paul is described as annoying, very short-tempered (which sets off his transformation frequently), cocky and dominating, despite his young age.He can, however, be fun-loving and childish.Brady is noted as having black hair and brown eyes, and being nearly 6 feet tall.In wolf form, Brady has dark, ashy-brown fur that almost appears gray.Collin has black hair, brown eyes, russet skin and is nearly 6 feet tall.Collin's wolf form is described as having reddish-brown fur, with his legs, face and tail being slightly darker.\nThe Black pack:Growing from 5'10 to 6'7 within one year, Jacob is the tallest character in the series,he is also said to be extremely handsome, with dark good looks, raven-black hair, russet skin  and deep-set twinkling dark brown eyes.As a wolf, Jacob is about 10 feet in length, has russet brown fur, dark intelligent eyes, and is very swift. He was also the second-fastest and the second largest in Sam's pack. He later grows to be the largest and strongest, but Leah Clearwater is still faster than him. Sam acknowledged him as the pack's strongest fighter. Bella is still amazed that Jacob did not take the role of Alpha in Sam's pack, though he eventually creates his own pack.Generally, Jacob is very friendly, playful, carefree, and caring towards the people around him. He would go to any extent to protect those he loves most,He is also shown to be somewhat sarcastic, slightly obnoxious and slightly childish, and has a hot-headed temper due to his wolf side and highly dislikes the scent of vampires.Leah Clearwater is the Beta of the Black pack and the only known female shape-shifter in Quileute history. She is Seth Clearwater's older sister, and Sam Uley's ex-girlfriend. She phased into a wolf during the events of New Moon, around the same time as her brother, Seth. She also has deeply unsettled issues, including a broken heart, and is overprotective of her little brother. Leah as a human is described as beautiful in an exotic way. She has perfect copper skin and eyelashes \"like feather dusters\", and being around 5'10\" tall. She wears her sleek black hair in a short pixie cut after phasing, for the same reasons that the males shave their heads: longer hair means longer fur.Edward describes her in her wolf form as a \"smallish gray wolf\". Leah is portrayed as angry and bitter as a result of her broken heart. She has a short temper,However, she also demonstrates considerable loyalty to them and protectiveness of her brother, and her pack mates.Seth as having a \"tall, gangly build\", with a youthful face and a \"huge, happy grin\" with brown eyes and around 6 feet tall. His skin is russet colored and his hair is black, worn short like the other boys in the pack.As a wolf, Seth remains tall and gangly, and has sandy colored fur and oversized paws.Seth is slightly immature and childish, but cheerful, optimistic and exceptionally kind, much like Angela Weber. He idolizes both Jacob and Edward. Edward comments that he has one of the purest, kindest, sincerest minds he'd ever heard. He can also be depicted as forceful and independent when he wants to do something important.Seth is noted to have the best hearing among his pack mates.As a human, Embry is described as being tall and slender, with russet skin, long rounded muscles, cropped black hair and brown eyes. Before phasing into a wolf, however, he had a thin face and shoulder length black hair. As a wolf, EmbryShapeshifters abilities includes:Phasing(transforming into a giant animal), Regeneration (faster healing abilities),Telepathy\nOnly works within the pack, and when in animal form,Natural enhancements(strength,smell,vision ect),Delayed aging\nThey cannot start aging until a solid period of time without phasing goes by,high body temperature,Alpha voice and Imprinting :Imprinting is the involuntary mechanism by which shape-shifters find their soulmates. It is a profound, intimate phenomenon that exists among the shape-shifters.",
