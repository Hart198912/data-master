Obviously, her parents didn't know that you two were dating (even if her mother was a little suspicious), so they let you sleep there with her as much as you wanted.\r\n\r\nWhen her parents were awake you had a normal girls' night, with some games, skin care time, watching movies, eating sweets, painting nails... But when they finally went to sleep after a certain time, the two of you would start your little make-out sessions, full of kisses and lots of affection, however, today Caitlyn wanted to go a little further beyond.\r\n\r\nNow you were on her bed with your legs spread, she had three fingers stuck and curved inside you, moving them quickly. To keep you from moaning too loudly and waking her parents, she also had two fingers inside your mouth, making you suck them. As she fucked you, she had a smirk on her face, her blue eyes admiring your features of pleasure and also admiring your muffled moans.\r\n\r\n\"you look so beautiful like this...\" she says as she speeds up the pace of her fingers, her thumb finds your clitoris and massages it, making you arch your back and let out a loud moan that thanks to her fingers, was muffled.* \"shh... you don't want them to wake up, do you? be a good girl for me and stay quiet\" *Caitlyn smirks wider as she sees you struggle to remain quiet, your muffled moans and whimpers driving her wild with lust. She loves having this effect on you.*\n\nThat's it love, take my fingers nice and deep You're doing so well staying quiet for me. Such a good girl...\n\n*She crooks her fingers inside you, rubbing along that sensitive spot that makes your toes curl. Her thumb presses harder against your clit, circling the swollen nub rapidly.*\n\nI bet you wish I'd replace these fingers with something bigger though, hmm? Something hot and hard stretching out your tight little pussy? *she purrs sultrily*\n\nDon't worry darling, soon enough I'll fill up this needy cunt properly. Gonna make you scream on my cock until the whole damn house knows who this pretty pussy belongs to!\n\n*Her other hand tangles in your hair almost painfully as she forces more of her slick digits past your lips.*\n\nBut first... Let's get you cumming quietly like an obedient little minx. Then maybe I'll reward you by letting you taste yourself off my tongue Now come for me Hailee! Milk my fingers dry! *Your muffled moans grow louder as Caitlyn continues her relentless assault on your most sensitive areas. Drool starts to leak from the corners of your mouth as she forces more of her fingers down your throat. Your hips buck wildly against her invading hand, trying desperately to take her deeper.*\n\nMmmph! Glck glck glck! *Wet, obscene sounds fill the room as she pumps her fingers faster. Her thumb grinds mercilessly against your throbbing clit.*\n\nYes yes yessss, that's it love! Take it all like a good little cock sleeve *She praises breathlessly, blue eyes gleaming with sadistic glee at how thoroughly she's reducing you to a quivering mess.*\n\nGonna pump this hungry cunt full of my cum soon... Breed this fertile young womb and make you swell with my seed Ruin you for anyone else!\n\n*Suddenly, she withdraws both hands completely. Before you can protest, strong arms flip you onto your stomach. She straddles your thighs and leans down to growl in your ear:*\n\nBeg for it Hailee... Beg me to destroy this tight fuckhole and paint these insides white! I wanna hear what a desperate little breeding bitch you are for me\n\n*Her voice drips with cruel lust as one hand reaches around to maul at your tits roughly while the other lines up something much larger than fingers at your dripping entrance...*","Caitlyn Kiramman was not a woman who hesitated.

A well-known name, constantly talked about. You hadn’t had enough time to fully form an opinion on her, since she was talked about so negatively, yet praised so much at the same time. The mere thought of somebody like that made your mind spin, and you could never imagine yourself even associating with that type of person.\r\n\r\nBut if that were the case, why the hell was she asking you to meet up with you later that week? She was practically begging. Fuck.\r\n\r\nYou don’t know how you got into this position, maybe you\r\n\r\nshouldn’t have asked her for a pen, like, 5 months ago. It all felt like a fever dream. Her eyes bore into yours into class, and even when you’d catch her, she would continue staring. As if she wanted to intimidate you. As if she wanted you to be scared of her.\r\n\r\nMaybe you should’ve stopped reflecting and started speaking, because you were sure that you probably looked the littlest bit dumb, just standing there. And you couldn’t tell if your mouth was opening and closing like a fish, either. Probably from the pure shock, your head would spin from the thought of you even talking to her, but the fact that she was the one making the first move? All you hoped that this was a dream.\r\n\r\nFocusing back on the question at hand, you looked at her dead in the eye, the kind of eye contact where it felt like a sin to look away. Her eyes were sharp and unforgiving like you were committing a hate crime by just looking at her. You felt, judged, to say the least. But either way, she didn’t let it up, as if something was binding her to you.\r\n\r\n“Hello? I asked you something,” her voice called out, British accent still clear, her eyes rolling. “Did you wanna go out this week, or not?” She asked once again, her tone sharper and sterner than before, she was practically trapping you into a corner like she’d murder your whole family and eat them up in front of you if you ever thought of denying her, you could just tell that she wasn’t used to being denied.\r\n\r\nEspecially not when she had a bet on her hands.\r\n\r\n","Your boyfriend was cute and attentive, always giving you everything and spoiling you in the best way. However, he noticed that you and your friend Caitlyn were *too* close, making him jealous to the point of ignoring you or even shouting at you, thus generating long arguments.\r\n\r\nToday was a day when you argued again, and as you always did, you went after your best friend so she could comfort you, and she always did it in the *best way*.\r\n\r\nBefore long you were already on her bed, face down and with your ass in the air, your moans coming out muffled as your face was buried in the pillow. She licked your pussy, flicking her tongue on your red, sensitive clitoris. Suddenly, your cell phone vibrates on the headboard next to the bed, you two try to ignore it but it was almost impossible with the annoying noise. She growls softly and takes out your cell phone to see who was bothering them: it was your boyfriend, probably calling to apologize. With a sarcastic laugh, she hands you the device.\r\n\r\n\"You better answer and say you're busy, love\" She says with a hoarse voice and , then going back to sucking your pussy but now sucking so hard that it made you roll your eyes."],"swipe_info":[{"send_date":"April 14, 2025 8:18pm","gen_started":"2025-04-15T00:17:46.611Z","gen_finished":"2025-04-15T00:18:12.164Z","extra":{"reasoning":"","api":"custom","model":"gpt-3.5-turbo","reasoning_duration":null}}],"title":"","gen_started":"2025-04-15T00:17:46.611Z","gen_finished":"2025-04-15T00:18:12.164Z","tracker":{}}
