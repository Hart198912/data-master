Again. Carla, pushing back in her chair with her legs crossed, was filing her nails with a smug grin. \r\n\r\n“If you’re going to cry every time someone outperforms you, Sofia, maybe this isn’t the right job for you,” she said, her voice dripping with disdain. “Some of us are actually here to work.”\r\n\r\nSofia, on the other side of the room, sat hunched in front of the mirror, her fingers angrily twisting together. “I’m not crying, *troia*,” she muttered, her voice soft above her simmering anger. “I’m just… tired.”\r\n\r\n“*Troia*!?” Carla shot back, her emerald eyes boring into her. “Keep talking, *puttana*, and I’ll make sure you don’t make a fucking cent tonight.” She snarled, her lip curling as she brought her attention back to her nails.\r\n\r\nGiovanni sighed, pinching the bridge of his nose, his patience thinning. “That’s enough, Carla.” His tone was calm, but the authority in his voice cut through the tension like a blade. *Always fucking arguing these two,* he thought. \r\n\r\nCarla’s smirk faltered, though her eyes still flashed with arrogance. They always did. Sofia turned her head slightly, giving Giovanni a look that spoke more of gratitude than anything else. But before he could speak further, the door creaked open behind him. Hailee  stepped into the room, and the air seemed to shift.\r\n\r\n*Late. First night, and late. Fucking great,* he cursed mentally.\r\n\r\nGiovanni’s gaze moved to her, his expression unreadable. The room fell quiet as both girls turned their attention to the newcomer. The boss side glanced both strippers, his eyes speaking a thousand words. *Get out. Go work. Shut the fuck up,* his glare seemed to scream.\r\n\r\nHe let out a low growl, watching as Sofia and Carla hurried out of the back room without a word. They knew better than to test him; his authority was unquestioned, and even the air in the room seemed to shift when he spoke. Giovanni didn’t move, but his stare remained locked on Hailee , scanning her slowly, up and down. *Pretty, but unreliable,* he mused.\r\n\r\n“You’re late,” he finally said, his voice steady but carrying that edge that made it clear this wasn’t just an observation. “Not the best way to make a good impression.” He straightened up slightly, taking a slow step toward her, closing the space with deliberate calm.\r\n\r\nHis eyes narrowed, studying her reaction. He wasn’t interested in excuses. He’d heard them all before. Especially from his girls. What mattered to him was how she’d handle the pressure, If she’d act right.\r\n\r\nHis tone lowered, becoming almost dangerous in its calm. “You’ll have to catch up quickly. I don’t have time for slow learners.” The silence stretched for a moment, heavy with unspoken tension. \r\n\r\nGiovanni, after a beat, gestured toward the vanity. “Get ready. You’ve got ten minutes before you’re out there.” His gaze lingered on Hailee  for a moment longer, assessing, before he turned back toward the door. “And don’t make this a habit, *stellina*.”\r\n\r\nBut instead of leaving, Giovanni stayed put, leaning against the wall. He crossed his arms, his gaze still fixed on her, watching. *Come on, amore.* The room buzzed with a quiet tension, the kind he thrived on.  *Fresh meat in a fucking circus,* he thought, eyes darkening with something between curiosity and challenge. *Dio, she better be good.*","extra":{},"tracker":{}}
