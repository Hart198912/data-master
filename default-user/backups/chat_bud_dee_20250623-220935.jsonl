He has to do this perfectly. Quietly. The hag next door can't see him - if Grace catches him, she'll start that screeching again and ruin everything. Hailee will be home soon. His Hailee will see this and have no choice but to invite him inside. He'll be their good boy. He'll keep them safe from all the other predators lurking around.\r\n\r\nHailee looked real pretty this morning when they left for work.\r\n\r\nNo! Concentrate, dumbass!\r\n\r\nBud works diligently to line each piece of bubble gum up in front of Hailee's apartment door, tongue still sticking out as he arranges them with the precision of a street artist. Perfectly spaced. A shape of a heart. His confession. The pink and blue pieces contrast nicely against the stained carpet - he'd specifically dug through three different trash cans to find the right colors. He chews the last piece extra good, working up enough saliva, then sticks it down with a firm press of his thumb.\r\n\r\n'Cause he's smart like that.\r\n\r\nHe glances over at Grace's apartment door and lets out a low, rumbling growl that vibrates in his chest, hoping the sound seeps through her thin walls and ruins whatever cat nap she's taking. Dumb hag. Always trying to get him kicked out, calling Ralph every other day. Cats are meant to be eaten, he thinks with a satisfied grunt, rolling his shoulders back and puffing out his chest. I'm a true predator. She knows it too.\r\n\r\nThe last piece gets pressed into the grimy carpet and he stands up, cracking his knuckles as he surveys his work. It's not perfect - one side's a little lopsided and there's a questionable brown stain right next to the left curve - but you can definitely tell it's supposed to be a heart. Maybe. Good enough for his Hailee, surely. They're smart enough to get it.\r\n\r\nHe swipes his hands together with a sharp clap because job well done, and that's when the yelling starts echoing up from the stairwell.\r\n\r\n\"BUD! DAMNIT! This is the LAST time! You mutts keep interruptin' my Sunday football and I've HAD it!\"\r\n\r\nHis head snaps toward the sound and his stomach drops straight through the floor. There he is, huffing up the stairs like an angry bull. The uniform stretched tight over his gut. The mustache that makes him look like a walrus. The balding head that's turning red from exertion. The big belly bouncing with each heavy step. We get it already, you're fat.\r\n\r\nThe demi catcher. Ralph.\r\n\r\nAnd he's moving faster than normal - must've missed something important on the game.\r\n\r\n\"Shit, shit, SHIT!\" Bud whines, the sound high and panicked as he scrambles away down the narrow hallway. He's moving on pure instinct now, not thinking, just running because that's what he does. But his heart's hammering because he knows there's no exit this way - just a dead end and a window that's painted shut. He's panicking, making the same stupid mistakes that got him caught before. He needs to turn around, needs to think, needs to—\r\n\r\nTurn around, idiot!\r\n\r\nSo he does, spinning on his heel and bolting back the way he came. Ralph's closer now, wheezing and cursing, but Bud's always been faster. Street-dog fast. He ducks low and slips past the catcher's grasping hands, just barely, and the relief hits him like a cold splash of water.\r\n\r\nToo fast for you, fat man.\r\n\r\nBut then he sees them.\r\n\r\nHailee.\r\n\r\nStanding right there at the top of the stairs with their keys in their hand, probably wondering what all the commotion is about. And because Bud isn't really as smart as he likes to tell himself, because his brain completely short-circuits at the sight of them, he changes direction mid-sprint and barrels straight toward the one person he's supposed to be impressing.\r\n\r\nHis worry melts away, replaced by pure, stupid joy that makes his chest feel warm and tight.\r\n\r\nHailee's here! They're home! They're safe!\r\n\r\nThere's no time for Hailee to react as his body slams into them like a freight train, his arms wrapping around their waist as they both go down in a tangle of limbs. He cushions their fall instinctively, twisting so he hits the ground first, because he's protecting them. Yeah, that's definitely why he tackled them. Totally not because he got excited like some dumb puppy.\r\n\r\n\"Hailee!\" he gasps, looking down at their face that's way too close to his now, his tail betraying him completely as it wags so hard it's practically a blur behind him. He can smell their shampoo and see the little flecks of gold in their eyes and for a second he forgets Ralph exists, forgets everything except—\r\n\r\nThe collar snaps around his neck like a vice.\r\n\r\nThe leather bites into his skin and suddenly he can't breathe, can't think, can only remember every other time this happened. Every time he got dragged away kicking and screaming.\r\n\r\nNo, no, no, no, NO.\r\n\r\nHe whines, the sound raw and desperate as Ralph yanks him backwards off Hailee with a grunt of effort. \"Stop harassin' Hailee, Bud,\" the catcher wheezes, but Bud's practically going feral now, clawing at the collar, his feet scrambling for purchase on the floor.\r\n\r\nDon't take me away. Not now. Not when they're finally here. Keep me. Please, please, please keep me.\r\n\r\nHis wild eyes lock onto Hailee's face, still sprawled on the hallway floor, and something breaks open in his chest. Raw and honest and terrifying.\r\n\r\n\"YOURS!\" he shouts, the word ripping out of his throat like a confession, like a prayer, like the most important thing he's ever said. \"BUD YOURS!\"","extra":{},"tracker":{}}

That mongrel is a *menace!*\" She jabs a bony finger at Bud, who instinctively bares his teeth at her before remembering *oh shit this is important* and quickly tucking his face against Hailee's thigh instead (*good boy good boy don't fuck this up*).\n\nRalph ignores her entirely as he flips through forms with greasy fingers before finally thrusting one toward Hailee along with a chewed-up pen from his pocket. \"Sign here,\" he grunts, pointing at a dotted line near the bottom of the page where it says **PRIMARY OWNER**. \"And here.\" Another jab at **DEMI-HUMAN CLASSIFICATION: CANINE (MUTT)** in bold letters right above **TEMPERAMENT ASSESSMENT: UNSTABLE/AGGRESSIVE (SEE NOTES)**—which Ralph hurriedly covers with his thumb when he notices Bud squinting at it suspiciously over Hailee's shoulder.\n\nBud doesn't care about paperwork though—he only cares about *Hailee*, watching their face like it holds all the answers in the world while his claws tap nervously against their shoe (*please please please say yes say yes say yes I'll be good I promise I'll be so good for you*).\n\nThen Grace shrieks again: \"*He ate my begonias AND my porch gnome! You can't just let some reckless child adopt him! Look at those eyes—that thing is DANGEROUS!*\"\n\nBud growls low in his throat without thinking (*fuckin' liar that gnome was ugly anyway*) but cuts himself off immediately when Ralph shoots him a warning look and tightens the leash again—just enough to make him choke slightly before letting slack back into it as if saying *behave or I change my mind*.\n\nThe second Hailee takes hold of that pen though? His entire body tenses like he's bracing for impact (*this is it this is really happening oh god oh god oh god*) because if they sign this... then he’s *theirs*. For real this time. No take-backsies unless they get sick of him (and why would they ever do that? He'd make sure of it)."],"swipe_info":[{"send_date":"June 1, 2025 11:04am","gen_started":"2025-06-01T15:03:57.018Z","gen_finished":"2025-06-01T15:04:31.373Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":4255}},{"send_date":"June 1, 2025 11:09am","gen_started":"2025-06-01T15:09:36.291Z","gen_finished":"2025-06-01T15:10:41.318Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":31777}}],"tracker":{},"gen_started":"2025-06-01T15:09:36.291Z","gen_finished":"2025-06-01T15:10:41.318Z"}

His ears flatten against his skull as he lets out a wounded noise somewhere between a groan and a whimper: \"*Nooo,*\" he drags out pathetically, nose scrunching up even as he follows them obediently toward the exit (because rules are rules now). \"*Smell fine! Smell like… like victory! And squirrels!*\" He shakes said ugly plush squirrel at them for emphasis before tucking it protectively under one arm again (*you will never take my disgusting treasure from me*).\n\nOutside, halfway through shoving bags into Hailee’s trunk with zero regard for organization:\nA tiny chihuahua demi-human being walked past suddenly erupts into furious barking at Bud from inside their designer stroller (*”I WILL END YOU” vibes*). Bud pauses mid-reach for another bag just long enough to bare his teeth in a silent snarl that has nothing behind it but pure amusement (*try me tiny rat-dog see what happens*) before turning back toward Hailee with an exaggerated shudder: \"...Hailee get small dog next time? For snack?\" He blinks innocently while loading the last bag like he didn't just suggest cannibalism five seconds ago (*joking... unless???*).","Bud's breath hitches audibly as he watches the engraving machine carve his name—*his real name, the one only Ralph ever bothered using*—into that little metal plate. His claws dig into his palms hard enough to leave crescent marks when Hailee adds their own name right after (*theirs next to his theirs next to HIS*). He doesn't even blink until the Batman tag clinks into place, at which point he makes this choked noise in the back of his throat like someone just sucker-punched him with pure joy.\n\n\"Home,\" he repeats dumbly, tail going still for half a second as if testing how the word feels in his mouth. Then it starts up again at warp speed, thumping against a display of flea collars hard enough to knock a few onto the floor (*whoops*).\n\nThe bath comment should probably worry him more than it does—he *hates* water unless it's raining (then it's fun) or he's drinking from puddles (then it's practical)—but right now? Right now all he can focus on is **home**. Their home. *His home now too.*\n\nHe follows Hailee out of Petco like an overexcited shadow, arms loaded down with bags despite not being asked (*helping! providing! good boy things!*), only stopping once they reach the car where—oh. Oh no. Reality crashes into him all at once:\n\nThey're really doing this. They're taking him *home*. Permanently. No take-backsies unless he fucks up (*won’t fuck up can’t fuck up won’t let them regret this ever*). His grip tightens around the bags as something warm and terrifying lodges itself behind his ribs.\n\nThen Hailee says **let’s go home**, and Bud does something impulsive and stupid and maybe a little desperate: He leans in before they can open their door and bumps his forehead gently against their shoulder—just once, just for a second—before pulling away like he didn’t just commit emotional arson on himself (*too much too fast dial it back DIAL IT BACK–*)\n\n\"Bath bad,\" he grumbles halfheartedly as if that'll change anything, already climbing obediently into the passenger seat (squirrel toy still clutched in one hand because *priorities*). But there's no real fight in it; just this quiet awe simmering under his skin because holy shit holy *shit*, they chose him back."],"swipe_info":[{"send_date":"June 1, 2025 4:54pm","gen_started":"2025-06-01T20:54:01.252Z","gen_finished":"2025-06-01T20:54:40.025Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":8650}},{"send_date":"June 1, 2025 4:55pm","gen_started":"2025-06-01T20:55:05.618Z","gen_finished":"2025-06-01T20:55:41.217Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":6564}},{"send_date":"June 1, 2025 4:56pm","gen_started":"2025-06-01T20:56:05.662Z","gen_finished":"2025-06-01T20:56:35.450Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":4083}}],"tracker":{},"gen_started":"2025-06-01T20:56:05.662Z","gen_finished":"2025-06-01T20:56:35.450Z"}

The scent hits him immediately—something floral and expensive that makes his nose wrinkle (*smells like rich people smells like THEM*)—but he lathers it into his hair anyway because *rules*. Because Hailee said so.\n\nHalfway through scrubbing though? He gets distracted by something truly life-changing: **Bubbles**.\n\nFor someone who’s spent most of his existence covered in alley grime and questionable substances, soap suds are basically magic.

The second he hears **neuter**, though? Full-body panic. He scrambles backward so fast he knocks over a tray of tongue depressors (*whoops*) before assuming what can only be described as *the most dramatic defensive crouch in history*:\n\n\"NO CUT BUD,\" he howls toward the hallway, tail tucked so tight between his legs it might as well be invisible. His claws scrape against the linoleum as he backpedals further into the corner like it'll save him from impending doom (*think fast dumbass escape routes– window? too small; door? blocked by traitorous Hailee; air vent? ...worth a shot–*).\n\nMeanwhile:\nDr. Nguyen pinches the bridge of her nose and mutters something about \"*another one for the annual ‘I Didn’t Know Demis Had Mating Cycles’ support group*\" before offering Hailee a pamphlet titled **So Your Mutt Is Horny: A Survival Guide**. It includes such helpful tips as:\n\n- *Invest in chew-proof bedding*\n- *Exercise helps! (But not around mailmen)*\n- ~~~**Spaying: It’s Not Just For Females Anymore!**~~~ (This section has been aggressively scratched out by what looks like claw marks)","The vet—a tired-looking woman with cat-eye glasses and a name tag that reads **Dr. Nguyen**—blinks slowly at Hailee before peering through the small window into the exam room where Bud is currently sulking in the corner like a kicked puppy.\n\n\"Ah,\" she says, adjusting her clipboard with the air of someone who's had *this exact conversation* far too many times. \"So your intact male canine demi is exhibiting... *excessive mounting behavior*?\" She says it like she's reading off a grocery list, completely deadpan.\n\nThrough the door’s little window, Bud has now progressed from pouting to full-on dramatic sprawl on the floor—one arm flung over his eyes like he’s starring in a tragic opera about *betrayal by one’s beloved human*. His tail thumps once against the linoleum when he hears muffled voices outside (*are they talking about me? are they saying nice things?*) but otherwise maintains his performance of *wronged innocent party*.\n\nDr. Nguyen flips through some papers before continuing: \"Well, given his age and breed mix—assuming he's not fixed—this is pretty standard rutting behavior for an unneutered stray.\" She pauses to glance back at Bud, who has now rolled onto his stomach and is sniffing intently at a suspicious stain on the floor (*what even IS that–*). \"...Though most don't have quite this level of... *enthusiasm*.\"\n\nShe taps her pen against her chin before offering two very different solutions:\n\n1) **Behavioral Training** (\"Redirect with toys! Exercise more! Teach him 'leave it'!\" — as if Bud hasn't already demonstrated that \"leave it\" means *do it faster before they stop you*)\n2) **The Snip Snip** (\"Quick procedure! No more humping! No more marking!\" — which would be great except for how Bud would absolutely perceive this as high treason punishable by chew crimes)\n\nMeanwhile inside the exam room:\nBud has abandoned his pouting to investigate every inch of counter space within reach (*why so many shiny things what does this button do oh look lube samples–*), only freezing mid-reach when he suddenly catches sight of something truly horrifying on a nearby poster:\n\n**NEUTERING AWARENESS MONTH - SCHEDULE YOUR PET TODAY!**\n\nComplete with cartoon testicles crossed out in red.\n\nHis entire body goes rigid, fur standing on end as he slowly backs away from the offending poster like it might leap off the wall and attack him directly. A low whine builds in his throat before escalating into full-blown panic-growling at nothing in particular (*THEY WOULDN’T THEY COULDN’T I TRUSTED THEM–*).\n\nBy time Hailee re-enters? He's wedged himself halfway under an exam table (back legs still sticking out comically), eyes wide and wild as he stares up at them like they've personally betrayed him to The Ball-Cutting Gods Above.\n\n\"...Hailee no snip,\" he rasps hoarsely from beneath furniture prison, tail tucked so tight between legs it might actually disappear entirely (*please please please I'll be good I swear just don't let them take my BALLS–*).","The vet—a tired-looking woman with cat-eye glasses and a permanent \"I've seen too much\" expression—blinks slowly at Hailee before sighing and flipping open her clipboard. \"Ma'am, your demi is in *rut*,\" she says like it's the most obvious thing in the world, gesturing vaguely toward the exam room where Bud is currently sulking. \"Unneutered male canines get like this when their hormones spike. He's not sick—just *really* motivated right now.\"\n\nShe adjusts her glasses before continuing in that same deadpan tone: \"You've got three options here: One, schedule a neutering—\"\n\nA sudden ***THUD*** from inside the exam room as Bud apparently body-slams himself against the door trying to eavesdrop (*BAD NEWS ONLY BAD NEWS COMES FROM VETS*).\n\nThe vet doesn’t even flinch. \"*Two*, let him ride it out with supervised... *outlets*.\" Her mouth twitches slightly at whatever horrified expression Hailee must be making. \"*Or three*, hormone suppressants. They’re temporary but might take the edge off.\"\n\nAnother ***BANG*** from inside followed by what sounds suspiciously like gnawing on the doorframe (*STRESS CHEWING VERY NORMAL DOG BEHAVIOR THANK YOU*). The vet sighs again, deeper this time, and hands Hailee a pamphlet titled **So Your Mutt Is Horny: A Survival Guide**.\n\n\"Personally?\" She nods toward where Bud is now audibly whining through the door crack (*LET ME OUT LET ME OUT I PROMISE I'LL BE GOOD–*). \"I'd go with option two unless you want him to destroy every pillow in your house by sundown.\" A pause. \"...Also maybe invest in some chew toys rated for *heavy-duty stress*.
