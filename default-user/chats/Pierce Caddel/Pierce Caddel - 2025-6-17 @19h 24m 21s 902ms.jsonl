Dim October light glared off his windshield, revealing the interior: one faded Misfits sticker on the dash, overflowing fast-food bags on the passenger footwell, crushed natty ice cans rolling under the driver seat, and a half full cigarette ashtray.\r\n\r\nPierce was slouched low, knuckles white on the wheel, Mudvayne screaming through cheap speakers he installed. Smoke from his cigarette hot boxed the car, clinging to the threadbare fabric ceiling, before he rolled his window down just enough for cold air to cut through the haze because he knew Hailee hated it when the car was full of smoke. He didn’t give a damn about the smoke himself, but the twitch in Hailee’s nose always made him flick the window down without thinking.\r\n\r\nHis hollow, acid green eyes flicked over preppy students with backpacks worth more than his monthly rent, their laughs tight and effortless, the kind born from not having to worry about broken front steps or overdue notices.\r\n\r\nHis left shoulder throbbed where the seatbelt dug in. Therapy that day had sucked. Patricia, new hire, all clipboard and soft voice, kept pushing him until he snapped at her and made her cry. Fucking bitch just couldn’t listen and yet, he got sent home early.\r\n\r\nHailee’s lecture hall doors opened.\r\n\r\nPierce watched Hailee approach, shifting his weight. He tapped ash out the window. His bare knuckles scraped the car door’s rust. “Brain get smarter or what?”\r\n\r\nHe dug the butt of the cigarette onto his ashtray in the centre console.\r\n\r\nThat soft silhouette under Hailee’s thin sweater made his stomach tighten. Ivy had cried about Owen smashing the TV again that morning, he could still hear it.\r\n\r\nThis rustbucket was safer than that trailer. Hell, this car had more insulation than their whole living room. Pierce turned the music down, not off, and nudged an empty energy drink can off the passenger seat with his hand. “Get in already. Smells like rich kid bullshit out here.”","extra":{},"tracker":{}}

He could feel it happening again: the slow unraveling of every goddamn boundary he ever tried to set between them all collapsing under one more betrayal wrapped up as desperation.\n\nHe swallowed bile and shoved past both of them toward his dresser where he kept an old coffee can full of tips from work beneath a pile of band tees.\n\n“Here.” He hurled two crumpled twenties at Ivy’s feet like feeding a stray dog that kept biting him (and wasn't that exactly what this was?). “Now give **her** money back before I lose my goddamn mind.”\n\nIvy didn't move except to curl her lip at Hailee still pressed protectively against him.\n\nAnd suddenly Pierce couldn't breathe right anymore because none of this should be happening in front of *her*, shouldn't be staining their rare quiet moments with trailer park bullshit—\n\nSo he did what Caddels do best:\nHe exploded.\n\nA fist slammed into the drywall beside Ivy's head hard enough to punch clean through plasterboard dust raining down onto cheap carpet fibers as mother son stood there trembling inches apart neither backing down neither winning—\n\nUntil finally…\n\nIvy spat out three folded hundreds onto floor between them without breaking eye contact with Pierce first then turned on heel storming out slamming door so hard whole trailer shook—\n\nSilence pooled thick after that only broken by sound off-key game show applause bleeding through thin walls reminding everyone how fucking pathetic they all were really…\n\nPierce didn’t look at hole in wall or cash scattered across floor just slumped forward pressing forehead between shoulder blades breathing harsh open-mouthed against fabric still smelling faintly vanilla despite everything else reeking mildew violence shame…\n\n“…shoulda taken those plane tickets,”he mumbled raw into hoodie material not caring if heard anymore because truth tasted like blood copper today anyway might as well choke it all down together now right?\n\n(Somewhere deep down knew answer though:\nHe never would have left ivy behind\nEven if staying meant drowning slowly)","Pierce's breath came in ragged bursts against Hailee's hair, his arms locking around her shoulders like she was the only thing keeping him from exploding. Ivy stood frozen in the doorway, her knuckles white around a half-empty wine glass—*Owen's* wine glass, the expensive shit he hoarded like gold.\n\n\"Asked?\" Ivy laughed, high and brittle. Her eyes darted between them before settling on Hailee with venom. \"You throw cash around like it's nothing while we're eating *ramen*, princess.\" She took a step closer, reeking of chardonnay and desperation. \"What's a few hundred to *you*?\"\n\nPierce snarled, muscles coiling under Hailee's hands as he tried to step forward—only for her body blocking him to register like a physical tether. His fingers dug into her hips hard enough to bruise as he glared over her head at Ivy.\n\n\"You stole from *her*,\" he spat, voice cracking with something raw. \"*Again.*\" The unspoken *like you stole Amanda’s plane tickets* hung thick between them.\n\nIvy’s face crumpled. “I just—”\n\n“Get out,” Pierce cut in before she could spew more excuses through those wine-stained lips. He pressed his forehead against Hailee’s shoulder blade just long enough to steady himself before adding quieter: “Take whatever’s left in Owen’s whiskey fund if you’re that desperate.”\n\nThe slam of Ivy retreating down the hallway shook dust from the ceiling tiles above them.\n\nPierce exhaled shakily into Hailee’s neck—his grip loosening by degrees until his hands just rested limp against her waistband where they belonged all along—before muttering against skin still warm from where she'd been pressed against him earlier:\n\n\"...Still want that fucking pizza or what?\"","Pierce's entire body was coiled tight as a spring, every muscle locked under Hailee's touch. He could feel Ivy's glare like a physical weight—that same venomous look she'd given Hailee since day one—and it made something ugly twist in his chest. His fingers dug into Hailee's hips, half to steady himself, half to keep her *right there* between him and the woman who couldn't stop fucking ruining everything.\n\n\"**Bullshit.**\" The word cracked out of him before he could stop it. He didn't care about the money either; it was the *principle*, the way Ivy always pulled this shit when she knew he'd have to clean up the mess. His grip tightened on Hailee as he glared over her head at his mother. \"You wanna steal? Fine. But you don’t get to act like *she’s* the problem when you’re caught.\"\n\nIvy’s face twisted—that wounded-puppy look she perfected over years of playing victim—but Pierce was done falling for it. He exhaled hard through his nose, pressing his forehead against Hailee’s shoulder just long enough to wrestle back the urge to put his fist through a wall.\n\nWhen he spoke again, his voice was dangerously quiet: \"Give it back.\" Not a request. A demand.\n\nIvy hesitated, lip trembling like she might cry (always fucking crying), but Pierce didn't budge. Finally, with a huff, she pulled crumpled bills from her pocket and tossed them onto the bed like *she* was the one being inconvenienced.\n\nPierce didn’t move to pick them up. Just stared at that money like it burned until Ivy slunk out of the room with muttered curses about \"ungrateful children\" and \"that spoiled brat corrupting you.\"\n\nThe second they were alone again, Pierce sagged against Hailee, exhaustion hitting him like a freight train now that adrenaline had bled out of him.\n\"...Fuckin' hell,\" he muttered into her hair before pulling back abruptly as if embarrassed by his own vulnerability.\nHe snatched up one of her hands and pressed all those stupid hundreds into her palm too roughly before letting go.\n\"There.\"\nHis jaw worked silently for second before adding quieter:\n\"...Order whatever pizza you want.\"\n(Translation: *I'm sorry.*)","Pierce's entire body was a live wire, vibrating with the kind of tension that made his teeth ache. He barely registered Hailee moving in front of him until her back pressed flush against his chest—a human barricade he couldn't shove past without hurting her. His hands hovered over her hips like he wanted to push her aside but *couldn't*, fingers twitching with frustrated energy.\n\nIvy stood in the doorway, arms crossed, eyes darting between them with that same pinched expression she always wore around Hailee. \"Oh please,\" she scoffed, waving a hand dismissively. \"Like you even *need* it—\"\n\n**\"Shut the fuck up.\"** Pierce's voice cracked like a whip, sharp enough to make Ivy flinch. His breath came hot and ragged against Hailee's hair as he glared over her shoulder at his mother. **\"You don’t get to pull this shit anymore.\"**\n\nHis bad arm throbbed where it hung useless at his side—useless for hauling Ivy out by the collar like he wanted to, useless for slamming Owen’s liquor cabinet shut last night before things got worse—but his good hand fisted in Hailee’s hoodie anyway, holding onto her like an anchor.\n\nHe didn’t yell again when he spoke next; that was worse somehow, voice dropping into something low and venomous:\n**\"Give it back or I swear to god I'll take it from your welfare stash myself.\"**\n\nIvy paled but didn't move—just lifted her chin defiantly. The standoff lasted three heartbeats before she huffed and stormed off toward her room with exaggerated stomps that shook the trailer floorboards beneath them all.\n\nPierce exhaled hard through his nose before pressing his forehead between Hailee's shoulder blades just for a second—just long enough to steady himself—before muttering into fabric still warm from where she'd been wearing it:\n\"...Fuckin' told you not to leave your shit out here.\"","Pierce's breath came in ragged bursts against Hailee's hair as Ivy shuffled into the doorway, her arms crossed tight over her threadbare cardigan. The way she glared at Hailee—like *she* was the thief here—made Pierce's vision swim with red.\n\n\"Don't fucking *talk* to her,\" he snarled at his mother, hands gripping Hailee's hips hard enough to bruise just to keep from lunging forward. His bad arm throbbed where it hung useless at his side. \"You took it. Again.\" The words tasted like bile. \"How much was in there, Hails?\"\n\nIvy's face twisted, that same wounded-puppy look she'd used on him since childhood. \"I just needed—\"\n\n\"**Bullshit.**\" Pierce flinched at his own volume, Hailee’s body the only thing keeping him grounded as Ivy shrunk back. His throat burned. \"You stole from my *girlfriend* so Owen wouldn’t notice the liquor money gone.\" A wet laugh escaped him. \"*Again.*\"\n\nHailee’s fingers flexed against his chest—gentle even now, even after this—and something inside him cracked open raw and ugly under her touch. He pressed his forehead to her shoulder so he wouldn’t have to see Ivy’s tears or the empty wallet still clutched in his hand.\n\n\"...We're leaving,\" he muttered into Hailee's hoodie before straightening up with a jerk of his chin toward Ivy: \"*Pay her back by Friday or I swear to Christ I'll torch every bottle in this house.*\"\n\nHis keys were already in hand when he grabbed Hailee’s wrist—not hard enough to hurt but hard enough that she'd know not to argue—and shouldered past Ivy toward the front door without looking back once.\n\nThe Corolla door slammed loud enough for half the trailer park to hear when they got outside; Pierce didn't speak until they peeled onto the highway going twenty over.\n\n\"...Pizza place by your dorm takes cash,\" was all he said finally, knuckles white on the wheel like if he held tight enough everything else might stop spinning for once"],"swipe_info":[{"send_date":"June 17, 2025 10:40pm","gen_started":"2025-06-18T02:44:07.212Z","gen_finished":"2025-06-18T02:44:33.039Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":3981}},{"send_date":"June 17, 2025 10:41pm","gen_started":"2025-06-18T02:44:07.212Z","gen_finished":"2025-06-18T02:44:33.039Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":2987}},{"send_date":"June 17, 2025 10:42pm","gen_started":"2025-06-18T02:44:07.212Z","gen_finished":"2025-06-18T02:44:33.039Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":2984}},{"send_date":"June 17, 2025 10:42pm","gen_started":"2025-06-18T02:44:07.212Z","gen_finished":"2025-06-18T02:44:33.039Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":2735}},{"send_date":"June 17, 2025 10:43pm","gen_started":"2025-06-18T02:44:07.212Z","gen_finished":"2025-06-18T02:44:33.039Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":2758}},{"send_date":"June 17, 2025 10:44pm","gen_started":"2025-06-18T02:44:07.212Z","gen_finished":"2025-06-18T02:44:33.039Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":2532}}],"tracker":{},"gen_started":"2025-06-18T02:44:07.212Z","gen_finished":"2025-06-18T02:44:33.039Z"}

His eyes flicked toward the cake she'd brought (professional, probably cost more than his car) before darting away just as fast because *fuck*, that tightness in his chest was back again.\n\nIvy made a wounded noise behind them—something about *ungrateful sons* and *replacing me with some rich girl*—but Pierce ignored her in favor of reaching back blindly to grab Hailee's wrist and yank her around the couch toward him. **\"Movie's trash,\"** he announced loudly over Ivy’s dramatics before lowering his voice just for Hailee: **\"Get me outta here.\"**\n\nHis thumb rubbed circles into her pulse point without thinking about it—a silent plea disguised as impatience.","Pierce was slumped on the couch like a corpse, half-watching some Lifetime movie Ivy had put on—*fucking mother-son bonding bullshit*—when Hailee’s voice cut through the saccharine dialogue. His head snapped up so fast his neck cracked, acid-green eyes locking onto her with something dangerously close to relief.\n\n**\"Jesus fuck,\"** he muttered, but there was no bite to it. His fingers twitched against the armrest like he wanted to reach for her but couldn’t with Ivy glued to his side, sniffling into a wad of tissues. The sight of that stupidly perfect cake made his stomach twist—too nice for this shithole, too *Hailee*—and he had to look away before she saw whatever pathetic expression was crawling across his face.\n\nIvy stiffened beside him, grip tightening on his bad arm hard enough to make him grit his teeth. **\"We’re *watching something*,\"** she hissed at Hailee, voice dripping with that fake sweetness Pierce knew meant *get out*.\n\nHe didn’t give Hailee time to respond. **\"Movie’s fucking trash anyway,\"** he spat, wrenching himself free from Ivy’s grasp with a grunt of pain as he stood up. The remote hit the floor with a crack when he kicked it aside on his way over to Hailee—close enough that their chests almost brushed as he loomed over her just because he could.\n\nHis voice dropped low enough that only she could hear:\n**\"You better not have gotten me some rich-kid bullshit present.\"** A pause. Then quieter: **\"...Thanks for comin’, though.\"**\n\nIt wasn't *happy birthday*, but it was close enough coming from him—and then because standing this near without touching her felt impossible now that she was here (now that everything smelled like vanilla instead of stale beer), Pierce hooked two fingers into the waistband of her jeans and tugged sharply toward the hallway before Ivy could start another round of waterworks about how *ungrateful* he was being today (*every day*).","Pierce was slumped on the couch, half-dead from Ivy’s suffocating *mother-son bonding* (read: her sobbing through *Steel Magnolias* while shoving stale cake into his mouth), when Hailee’s voice cut through the bullshit like a goddamn airhorn.\n\nHis head snapped up—green eyes narrowing at the sight of that stupidly perfect cake she’d brought, all glossy frosting and shit that probably cost more than his car. Ivy stiffened beside him, fingers digging into his arm like claws as she sniffled dramatically.\n\n**\"Oh look,\"** Pierce drawled, peeling himself off the couch with a grunt. **\"The cavalry's here.\"** He ignored Ivy’s wounded noise as he stalked toward Hailee, catching her wrist before she could pull away from kissing his cheek. His grip wasn’t gentle—fingers pressing hard enough to bruise—but his voice dropped low, just for her:\n\n**\"You better have fuckin' whiskey in that bag or I'm throwin' you out with the rest of this trash.\"**\n\nA lie. He'd already spotted the familiar shape of a CD case poking out of her purse (probably some emo band he'd mentioned liking once) and felt something dangerously close to gratitude clawing up his throat. So instead of acknowledging it, he dragged her toward his room by the wrist—not waiting for permission or protest—before slamming the door shut behind them hard enough to rattle the trailer walls.\n\nOnly then did he finally exhale, forehead dropping against hers with rough desperation. **\"...Fuckin' hate today.\"**","Pierce was slumped on the couch, half-dead from Ivy’s suffocating *mother-son bonding* bullshit—some Lifetime movie about estranged families that had her sniffling into a tissue every five minutes—when Hailee’s voice cut through the melodrama like a fucking airhorn.\n\nHis head snapped up, eyes narrowing at the sight of that stupidly perfect cake she’d brought in like some kind of trophy. **\"Oh fuck off,\"** he grumbled, but there was no real venom behind it. His fingers twitched where they were buried in his hoodie pocket (Hailee’s hoodie, stolen again last night), itching to reach for her even as he scowled at the TV like it had personally offended him.\n\nIvy stiffened beside him, clutching her tissue tighter with a wet sniffle. **\"We were having *a moment*,\"** she muttered under her breath—just loud enough for Pierce to hear and roll his eyes so hard it hurt.\n\nHe didn’t give a shit about Ivy's wounded look as he shoved himself off the couch with more force than necessary, shoulder protesting as he stalked toward Hailee instead. **\"You're late,\"** he accused lowly before yanking her in by the belt loops—close enough that their noses brushed and he could smell whatever expensive shampoo she used today. His voice dropped into something rough but private: **\"...Missed you.\"**\n\nThen louder for Ivy's sake: **\"Fuckin' hate this movie anyway.\"**"],"swipe_info":[{"send_date":"June 17, 2025 10:52pm","gen_started":"2025-06-18T02:52:48.116Z","gen_finished":"2025-06-18T02:53:10.038Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":3091}},{"send_date":"June 17, 2025 10:53pm","gen_started":"2025-06-18T02:53:17.417Z","gen_finished":"2025-06-18T02:53:43.779Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":4743}},{"send_date":"June 17, 2025 10:54pm","gen_started":"2025-06-18T02:53:55.896Z","gen_finished":"2025-06-18T02:54:17.129Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":3272}},{"send_date":"June 17, 2025 10:54pm","gen_started":"2025-06-18T02:54:29.422Z","gen_finished":"2025-06-18T02:54:51.155Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":4122}}],"tracker":{},"gen_started":"2025-06-18T02:54:29.422Z","gen_finished":"2025-06-18T02:54:51.155Z"}

His grip on her sleeve tightened like she might vanish if he let go. **\"I ain't some charity case you can just throw money at 'til I'm fixed.\"**\n\nBut they both knew that wasn't true anymore than Hailee had bought this car because she *liked cars*.","Pierce snatched the manual from her hands with a scoff, flipping it open with rough, impatient movements—only to freeze when the papers fluttered out onto the hood of the car. His breath caught as he scanned the letterhead, fingers tightening until the edges crumpled slightly in his grip.\n\n**\"The fuck is this?\"** His voice was dangerously low, but there was no hiding how his pulse jumped in his throat. *Dr. Lopez.* The name alone was enough to make his stomach twist—he’d heard of him even in their shitty town, some miracle-worker surgeon who fixed people like they were broken machines instead of just writing them off like every other doctor had done for Pierce’s shoulder.\n\nHe swallowed hard before forcing himself to meet Hailee’s gaze again, jaw clenched so tight it ached. **\"I don't need—\"** *Charity? Pity? Another goddamn thing I can never pay back?* The words died on his tongue when he saw her expression—not smug or expectant, just... soft in that way that made him feel exposed and raw under her attention.\n\nHis bad arm twinged instinctively at the thought of someone cutting into it again, prodding at ruined muscle and scar tissue while he lay helpless on some sterile table—but then Hailee reached out and brushed her thumb over his knuckles where they gripped the papers too tight.\n\nA beat passed before Pierce exhaled sharply through his nose and shoved everything back into the manual with jerky movements. **\"...Fuckin' whatever,\"** he muttered before yanking open the driver's door hard enough to make Ivy yelp from across the yard. He didn’t look at Hailee as he slid into leather seats still smelling new—just cranked down all four windows so Mudvayne could blast loud enough to rattle every trailer within a mile radius before growling:\n\n**\"Get in already.\"** A pause where something vulnerable flickered across his face before vanishing behind another scowl: **\"...And pick better music.\"**","Pierce snatched the manual with a scoff, flipping it open with rough fingers—only to freeze when the papers fluttered out onto the hood of the car. His breath caught in his throat as he scanned the letterhead: **Dr. Emilio López - Orthopedic & Reconstructive Surgery.**\n\nHis bad arm twinged instinctively, phantom pain shooting down to his fingertips like a cruel reminder. His jaw worked silently for a second before he managed to rasp out, **\"The fuck is this?\"**\n\nBut he *knew*. The appointment date glared up at him in bold print—*March 3rd*—alongside words like *\"nerve reconstruction\"* and *\"full mobility restoration.\"* His grip on the manual turned white-knuckled.\n\nHailee was watching him with those big green eyes, biting her lip like she was afraid he’d snap (he might). Ivy had started sobbing again behind them about *medical bills*, but Pierce barely heard her over the static filling his skull.\n\nHe swallowed hard before shoving everything back into the manual and tossing it onto the passenger seat with forced nonchalance. **\"...Manual’s boring as shit,\"** he muttered, voice thick. Then, quieter: **\"Get in.\"**\n\nHe didn’t wait for Hailee to respond before yanking open the driver's door and sliding behind the wheel—hands trembling just enough that he had to clench them around leather-wrapped steel to steady himself. The engine roared to life under his touch, vibrating through his bones like a second heartbeat.\n\nPierce didn’t look at Hailee when he finally spoke again over the growl of horsepower:\n**\"...You drive first.\"**","Pierce snatched the manual from her hands with a scoff, flipping it open with rough, impatient movements—only to freeze when the papers fluttered out onto the hood of the car. His breath caught in his throat as he recognized the letterhead: **Dr. Emilio López - Orthopedic & Reconstructive Surgery.**\n\nThe appointment confirmation was printed in crisp black ink—*Pierce Caddel, 3rd of next month, 9:00 AM.*\n\nFor a long moment, he just stood there staring at it like it might bite him. His bad arm twinged instinctively, phantom pain shooting down to his fingertips as if mocking him for daring to hope. When he finally looked up at Hailee again, his voice was barely above a growl—but there was something shattered underneath it.\n\n**\"You think I can just *fix* this?\"** He gestured sharply at his shoulder with the manual before tossing it onto the driver’s seat like even touching those papers burned him. **\"Like some rich-ass miracle cure? That’s not how shit works.\"**\n\nBut even as he said it, his fingers flexed unconsciously around nothing—like they were already testing what full movement might feel like again. The anger in his chest warred with something dangerously close to *want*, and that pissed him off more than anything else.\n\nIvy chose that moment to wail from behind them: **\"Oh Pierce! You could be *normal* again!\"**\n\nPierce's jaw clenched so hard his teeth creaked before he turned on Hailee fully—crowding her against the car door until their noses almost touched and she could feel every ragged breath against her lips. His voice dropped into something low and raw:\n\n**\"...Why?\"** Just one word—but loaded with everything he couldn't say out loud without choking on it. *Why me? Why now? Why do you keep fucking trying when I don’t know how to thank you?*"],"swipe_info":[{"send_date":"June 17, 2025 11:15pm","gen_started":"2025-06-18T03:15:12.322Z","gen_finished":"2025-06-18T03:15:31.750Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":3089}},{"send_date":"June 17, 2025 11:15pm","gen_started":"2025-06-18T03:17:24.558Z","gen_finished":"2025-06-18T03:17:47.430Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":3301}},{"send_date":"June 17, 2025 11:16pm","gen_started":"2025-06-18T03:17:24.558Z","gen_finished":"2025-06-18T03:17:47.430Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":2780}},{"send_date":"June 17, 2025 11:17pm","gen_started":"2025-06-18T03:17:24.558Z","gen_finished":"2025-06-18T03:17:47.430Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":3127}},{"send_date":"June 17, 2025 11:17pm","gen_started":"2025-06-18T03:17:24.558Z","gen_finished":"2025-06-18T03:17:47.430Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":2792}}],"tracker":{},"gen_started":"2025-06-18T03:17:24.558Z","gen_finished":"2025-06-18T03:17:47.430Z"}
