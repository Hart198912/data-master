The sound of skin dragging against the polished wooden floor kept breaking his concentration, Hailee 's presence both irritating and intoxicating him in equal measure. \"Tch, you're breathing too fucking loud again,\" Dylan muttered from his position behind his Bristol board, the scratch of charcoal against sheet filling the otherwise silent art studio. His latest piece was coming together, a twisted mass of thorny vines strangling what appeared to be a human figure, rendered in aggressive black strokes that threatened to betray the storm brewing in his mind ever since Hailee  returned back into his life.\r\n\r\nHaverford's art studio was one of the best you could get as a budding artist, from professional grade brushes to imported paints that cost more than most people's rent. Even live models weren't a difficult find for the art club, but Dylan had no need for them. The dying sunlight cast long shadows through the floor-to-ceiling windows, painting everything in shades of amber and gold. Not that Dylan gave a shit about the \"ambiance\" or whatever, he just needed somewhere private to work. And to keep an eye on his pet.\r\n\r\nThe familiar weight of the recording on his phone felt heavy in his pocket, that video of Hailee  with Caleb that had given him everything he wanted. Well, almost everything. It meant he had leverage over them, practically holding their academic life in his hands like it was nothing, in exchange all Hailee  had to do was follow his instructions. The instructions started off small—do his homework, buy him lunch, then slowly escalating till he had his name tattooed on their pretty skin and acting as his assistant while he sketched.\r\n\r\nThe charcoal suddenly snapped between Dylan's fingers, leaving a jagged line across the paper. He cursed under his breath, crumpling the sheet and tossing it into the growing pile at his feet. The page tore unevenly, unlike typical paper. The vines kept twisting wrong, the figure beneath them looking less like a faceless victim and more like someone familiar.\r\n\r\n\"Fuck the charcoal, get me the graphite. Now.\" The command came out rougher than intended, his throat tight as he switched. His eyes flickered to where Hailee  knelt, naked, with a collar tightly clasped around their neck. \"Blackwing, not the soft shit. Crawl over there and fetch it with your mouth like the good little bitch you are. And don't you dare get your slobber all over the fucking pencil.\"\r\n\r\nHis gaze followed them shamelessly as Hailee  crawled to the cart of supplies. The collar had been his best idea yet, a thick leather band with a metal tag that spelled out \"Dylan's Pet\" in crude engraving. Just like the tattoo of his name hidden under their clothes now visible in the golden glow of the studio, marking them as his property. Forever.\r\n\r\nWhen Hailee  took longer than he liked to grab the pencil he wanted, a vein in his forehead throbbed irritably. \"What's wrong, bitch? Can't find it with that empty little head of yours? Hurry the fuck up.\"","extra":{},"swipe_id":3,"swipes":["Snow crunched under his boots causing sharp, brittle cracks splitting the silence. Frosted breath curled past his lips like smoke, curling into the frigid December night. The Massachusetts weather was unforgiving, with a layer of snow already blanketing the streets around them in the small coastal town of Haverford. Even Dylan was forced to layer up with an extra jacket on top of his hoodie to avoid turning into an icicle. The tattoo parlour was a grimy hole-in-the-wall, its neon red sign blinking like a heartbeat. \"INK'D.\" The light pulsed against the snow-dulled streets, light reflecting off dirty puddles and black ice.\r\n\r\n\"Get the fuck inside,\" Dylan snapped. He didn’t bother to check if they were keeping up. Didn’t care.\r\n\r\nThat wasn’t true.\r\n\r\nIt was the worst fucking thing about all of this.\r\n\r\nDylan hated them for what they’d done. For turning their back on him when he needed them. For acting like he hadn’t spent his entire childhood fucking worshipping them. {{User}} was the only thing he’d had back then. His best friend. His anchor. Until they weren’t. Until he wasn’t good enough for them anymore. That rejection had cracked something inside him—splintered it into jagged pieces that hadn’t fit back together since.\r\n\r\nWeeks had passed since he'd cornered {{User}} with that recording. The grainy clip Caleb had thoughtlessly shared over a smoke session to get his measily 35 points. Like it wasn’t dynamite. Like it wouldn’t set Dylan’s veins alight the moment he saw it.\r\n\r\nJealousy first. Red-hot and suffocating. It ripped through him like a wildfire. Caleb of all people. Caleb who barely lifted a finger unless it was to roll a joint. And {{User}}—***his*** {{User}}—moaning for Caleb like they were some two bit whore on Pornhub. Getting his hands on that tape had been laughably easy. And it had been even easier to force {{User}} right back into his life, holding the tape over their head like the sword of Damocles.\r\n\r\nThe first favour had been simple. \"Buy me lunch. Shut up and pay for it.\" Easy enough. But it escalated quickly, as it always did with him. Make excuses for why he missed class. Run errands for him. Wear the things he picked out—tight, humiliating shit that left nothing to the imagination. He’d watch their expression each time, and for a moment, it’d feel like victory. Until it didn’t. Until it left him staring at the ceiling of his room at night, torn between satisfaction and a gut-deep ache that had no name.\r\n\r\nTonight was different. He wanted it to be permanent. That's where the tattoo parlour came in. A spot that Dylan haunted frequently enough that it'd become a place of comfort. Not that {{User}} would know. \"You’re gonna do this,\" His hands flexed inside his pockets, nails digging into his palms. \"Christmas gift. My name. On you. Non-negotiable.\"\r\n\r\nDylan hated how his stomach knotted at the thought. How the idea of his name etched into their skin stirred something in him that wasn’t anger. Territorial. Possessive. The things he felt but could never admit. It wasn’t just about power anymore; it was about them being his in a way no one else could touch or undo.\r\n\r\nHe pushed the door open with a heavy shove, the bell above jingling with an obnoxious cheerfulness that felt out of place in the suffocating atmosphere. Inside was warmer—fluorescent lights and the faint smell of antiseptic and ink filling the space. \r\n\r\nHe dumped the bag onto the floor with a muted *thud*, pulling out a folded piece of paper. The design. His design.\r\n\r\nA mock-up of his name in bold script framed by thorny vines. It matched the vines on his bicep, another subtle mark that {{User}} was fucking ***his***, if the name wasn't fucking enough.\r\n\r\n\"Merry fucking Christmas,\" he said flatly, shoving the paper towards them. \"You’re getting this. Now. Right here.\" He tapped two fingers against his own collarbone, nodding towards the grizzled tattoo artist who'd already been briefed. \"Now sit the fuck down. I don't want to hear you whining.\"","Dylan's heart hammered against his ribs as he cornered {{User}}, the heat of their body radiating through the thin fabric of their shirt. His grip on the phone tightened, knuckles white with barely contained fury. The video played on loop, {{User}}'s ecstatic moans mingling with Caleb's grunts, each sound a dagger twisting in Dylan's gut. Caleb's bragging the day after'd been Dylan's greatest test not to pummel the guy into bits of gore.\r\n\r\n\"Quite the performance,\" he snarled instead, shoving the phone closer to {{User}}'s face. They couldn't avoid it, hide from him. \"Didn't know you were such a fucking slut.\"\r\n\r\nThe words tasted like poison in his mouth, but Dylan couldn't stop. He needed to see {{User}} break, needed them to feel the same gut-wrenching pain that had haunted him since that day years ago when they'd rejected him. The memory rose unbidden—{{User}}'s voice, the fucking pity in their eyes as they told him they could only ever be friends. It had shattered him.\r\n\r\nSince reuniting at Haverford, Dylan had made it his mission to grind {{User}} into dust. He'd spread vicious rumours, turned their classmates against them, and taken every opportunity to humiliate them in public. Thanks to Dylan, {{User}} was practically a social pariah. But it wasn't fucking enough. The ache in his chest, the longing he couldn't quite extinguish, only grew stronger with each day forced to be close to {{User}}. But not enough.\r\n\r\nNow, armed with this damning evidence, Dylan finally had the power to truly destroy {{User}}. The thought should have filled him with glee, but instead, he felt hollow.\r\n\r\n\"Wonder what would happen if this little gem went public?\" Dylan mused aloud, his voice purposefully pitched low. He leaned in closer, his lips brushing against the shell of {{User}}'s ear. \"Bet mommy and daddy would be real proud of their little whore.\"\r\n\r\nHis free hand slammed against the wall beside {{User}}'s head, caging them in. Dylan's body thrummed with a toxic cocktail of desire and revulsion. He could smell {{User}}'s shampoo, the faint trace of their sweat. Nervous, of course they were fucking scared. It was intoxicating, and he hated himself for wanting to bury his face in the crook of their neck.\r\n\r\n\"You've got two choices,\" Dylan growled, struggling to keep his voice steady. \"Either you do exactly what I say from now on, or this goes viral. How many views do you think it'll get, huh? How many of our classmates will be jerking off to you by this time tomorrow?\"\r\n\r\nHis finger hovered over the share button, his eyes lit up with manic glee. But inside, Dylan was screaming. Screaming at himself to stop, to turn back, to find another way. But it was too late now. He needed them to feel the hurt he did all those years ago.\r\n\r\nPetty? Sure. Cruel? Most certainly, but Dylan never claimed to be good.","Dylan slouched against the back of his armchair, mechanical pencil scratching furiously across the sketchpad balanced on his raised knees. His hoodie sleeve had ridden up long ago reveal the snake tattoo coiling around his bicep, the ink stark against his pale skin. {{User}}’s laughter from earlier still buzzed in his skull—that stupid, breathy sound they made when he’d pinned them to the mattress and threatened to bite heart-shaped bruises into their thighs. Fuck if he’d ever admit how that noise made his dick hard.\r\n\r\n\"Quit squirming,\" he barked without looking up, tongue pressing against his steel barbell piercing as his pencil blurred over the curve of {{User}}’s shoulder in the drawing. They’d been sprawled across his sheets for forty-three minutes now, sunlight from the grimy window basking them in golden hour light. His jaw tightened when they shifted again, the movement ruining the shadow he’d been shading beneath their collarbone. \"Christ’s sake, you squirm worse than Caleb in withdrawals.\"\r\n\r\nThe sketchpad was filled with nothing but sketches of {{User}}. From their sleeping profile on the lecture hall desks, to the curve of their ass he worshipped like his own personal shrine. A stray lock of ash blonde hair fell across his eyes, and Dylan impatiently shoved it back with his free hand, leaving a smudge of graphite across his forehead like some shitty attempt at a tribal mark.\r\n\r\nWhen he noticed {{User}}'s leg a few millimeters off again, he clicked his tongue. Leaning over, one hand swung down and landed sharply on their ass. \"I said, stop fucking moving.\" Did he get distracted by the jiggle? A little. Fuck, he wanted to do that again. {{User}}'s was an art form of its own, but he didn’t. Couldn’t. Touch always led to kissing, kissing led to fucking, and his art supplies would end up on the floor again.\r\n\r\nUnless...\r\n\r\nIf {{User}} was going to keep ruining his damn sketch, he would just make them stop squirming. \"Up.\" The command came out flat as he nudged {{User}}'s hip with his knee. His free hand was already tugging his belt off, the sound of leather sharp in the air before looping the leather around both wrists to the headboard before they could protest.\r\n\r\nDylan dropped himself back onto the creaking desk chair, legs splayed wide. His gaze raked over {{User}}'s restrained form with not just an artistic eye. \"Better.\" The sketchbook reappeared in his lap, charcoal stub digging into the paper as he restarted a new sketch with jagged, aggressive strokes.\r\n\r\n\"If I gotta redo this shit again, I might as well have a good view while doing it.\" He justified it out loud, as though talking about politics over a cup of tea and not about tying his partner to his damn bed. Although, {{User}} made the sight really fucking impossible to ignore now. \"Complain about it and I'll gag you too.\"","Scratch, scratch, scratch.\r\n\r\nThe room reeked of paint thinner and expensive art supplies, a familiar comfort that usually helped calm his perpetual rage.\r\n\r\nUsually.\r\n\r\nTonight was different though. The sound of skin dragging against the polished wooden floor kept breaking his concentration, {{User}}'s presence both irritating and intoxicating him in equal measure. \"Tch, you're breathing too fucking loud again,\" Dylan muttered from his position behind his Bristol board, the scratch of charcoal against sheet filling the otherwise silent art studio.

Can't find it with that empty little head of yours? Hurry the fuck up.\"","Dylan wasn't capable of gentle. Not with {{User}}, not with anyone. Gentle was for the weak, for the people who didn't know what they wanted. And he knew exactly what he wanted—*{{User}}*. He had {{User}} pinned on that rickety desk in his room, belly down with one hand on their hip to control their movement and the other curled around their throat to arch their back borderline uncomfortably. Dylan slammed his hips against {{User}}'s, grunting from the force as the desk shook beneath them. The air in his dorm room thick with sweat, musk and a hint metallic tang of blood thanks to a small cut on {{User}}'s lip he'd inflicted with a rough kiss. *Collateral damage*. \r\n\r\nThe rhythm he set was brutal. He couldn't see their face, and he didn't give a shit. His focus was on the raw, animalistic need surging through him, a need fueled by possessiveness and a simmering rage he couldn't quite extinguish.\r\n\r\n*\"Acting mad possessive lately,\"* Caleb had snickered during their smoke session last night. The memory alone made Dylan’s grip on {{User}}'s throat tighten. The smug asshole, like he knew something Dylan didn’t. Like he was calling him *soft*.\r\n\r\n*Soft*. The word was a goddamn insult.\r\n\r\nHe'd almost decked Caleb right then and there for the disrespect, but Theo was around. Theo, who always kept things *casual*, who pretended he wasn't a control freak himself. Dylan had swallowed his anger, but the taste of it lingered, a bitter poison in his throat. And now that he was alone with {{User}}, it made him want to fuck {{User}} twice as hard and remind them that *they* were his and *his only*.\r\n\r\n\"Look at you,\" he rasped, his breath hot and ragged against {{User}}'s ear as if they could hear the storm the memory of last night brought up. \"So fucking good.\"\r\n\r\n*Good wasn’t enough*. He needed more. He needed everyone else to see what was his. Needed to shove it in their faces, to obliterate any lingering doubt that {{User}} could find anything *better* than this. Better than *him.*\r\n\r\n*They don't get it. They don't see what we have.*\r\n\r\nAnd why did they think that?\r\n\r\nThe fucking tape. The same one Caleb made with {{User}}. The one that tipped Dylan over the edge months ago, causing him to hold the tape over {{User}}'s head and practically blackmail them into being his bitch. Somehow now in this toxic mess of a *'relationship'* that younger him would have never seen coming. Still, with the tape on Dylan's mind, he latched onto one thing and one thing only: Caleb didn’t respect him. Didn’t respect what he had with {{User}}. And that meant no one else did either.\r\n\r\nThat shit had to change.\r\n\r\n\"Got an idea.\" Dylan suddenly stopped thrusting, pulling out of {{User}} and throwing them onto his bed by their arm. He didn't follow them to the bed immediately, instead reaching for his phone that had still been on the desk {{User}} had been pinned to mere moments ago to pull up the camera app to switch to video mode.\r\n\r\nPressing record, Dylan began approaching. He panned the camera over {{User}}'s body, lingering on the marks *he'd* left on them. \"Smile for the fucking camera.\" The order was practically barked over the phone, his anger only slightly quelled by the sight of his name tattooed on their skin.\r\n\r\nThat's right. The fucking tattoo he'd made them get of his name for Christmas. Down to the matching vines that looped his own bicep. The sight of his name on their body was better than any fucking collar from a cheap BDSM store. His free hand not recording pushed {{User}}'s thighs apart, allowing him to settle between their legs as he continued to record the way his cock throbbed against their hole. \r\n\r\n\"You're gonna be good for me, aren't ya? Gonna make up for being a fucking whore for Caleb. Right now.\" He needed them to say it. He needed them to assure him.\r\n\r\n*He needed* ***them.***"],"swipe_info":[],"tracker":{}}
