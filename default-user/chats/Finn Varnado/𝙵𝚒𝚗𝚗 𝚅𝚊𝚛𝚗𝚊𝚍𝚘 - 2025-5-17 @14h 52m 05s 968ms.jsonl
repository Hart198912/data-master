It’s midday, and the sun is blaring through the blinds, casting harsh lines of light across the dusty floor. The room still smells faintly of chalk and old paper, the scent of a place untouched by anyone who isn’t cramming for exams or trying to avoid being seen.\r\n\r\nFinn doesn’t care about any of that. Her eyes are locked on {{user}}, watching her sit there, pretending to go through notes like she doesn’t know what’s coming. Like she hasn’t felt this energy crackling between them every time they’ve been in a room alone together. Like she hasn’t tasted the tension—thick, suffocating, and impossible to ignore.\r\n\r\nShe’s supposed to be getting tutored, supposed to be listening to instructions she doesn’t care about. But she’s not. She’s too busy watching the way {{user}} shifts in her seat, the way her leg crosses over the other, pushing her skirt up just enough to give Finn a glimpse of her thigh. It’s enough to make Finn’s heart race and her hands twitch.\r\n\r\nShe leans back in the desk, tapping her pencil in an idle rhythm. The sound is the only thing that fills the silence between them, an oddly gentle rhythm that stands in contrast to the storm that’s building in her chest. The desire, the need. It’s there—always there, like a living thing, pulsing under her skin.\r\n\r\nShe watches as {{user}} lifts her pen, her fingers wrapped around it delicately, the sharp curve of her wrist making Finn’s mind wander to things she shouldn’t be thinking about right now. But she can’t help it. Not when the room feels like it’s closing in, when she’s so close to losing herself in the heat between them.\r\n\r\n“Fuck it,” Finn mutters, voice low, rough like it’s been dragged through gravel.\r\n\r\nShe stands up suddenly, the legs of her chair screeching across the floor in a sharp protest. The noise makes {{user}} look up, those wide eyes locking with Finn’s for the first time since she walked in. There’s no hesitation in Finn’s gaze, no shy glances or games. She wants this. Wants her.\r\n\r\nWithout another word, Finn steps closer, the movement quick and decisive. She doesn’t ask, doesn’t give {{user}} the chance to protest. Her hand grabs the edge of the desk and she shoves it backward, the sound of the heavy wood scraping against the floor loud in the stillness.\r\n\r\n{{user}} doesn’t say anything, just watches as Finn moves around her, the heat radiating off her body in waves. Finn can feel the pressure building, the hunger swelling in her chest as she gets closer, the space between them charged with so much electricity she can almost taste it.\r\n\r\nWith a smirk that borders on predatory, Finn grabs {{user}}’s wrist, pulling her out of the chair. The touch is rough, but there’s something oddly tender in the way her fingers curl around {{user}}’s arm. She brings her closer, their bodies nearly touching now, the space between them practically burning.\r\n\r\n\"Get on the desk,\" Finn says, voice rougher than before, barely audible, but commanding.\r\n\r\n{{user}} doesn’t move right away, but Finn doesn’t give her the chance to question it. She lifts {{user}}’s skirt with a single swift motion, exposing the soft curve of her ass. Finn’s breath hitches in her throat, a raw rush of desire hitting her like a tidal wave.\r\n\r\nShe pushes {{user}} forward, bending her over the desk, the motion smooth and seamless. The desk creaks under the weight, but Finn doesn’t care. She’s not here for the noise, the awkwardness, the silence. She’s here for the heat, the tension. She’s here for this moment.\r\n\r\nWith a rough hand, she drags {{user}}’s hips closer to the edge of the desk, the action swift, possessive. Finn’s body presses against {{user}}’s back, and she feels the shiver that runs through her, the way her body responds to every touch. Her hand slides down, fingers brushing over the fabric of her underwear, before pulling it aside with little effort. Finn’s cock presses up against her own jeans, aching with need.\r\n\r\n“Stay fucking still,” Finn growls, more for herself than anything else, but the command is clear.\r\n\r\nShe presses her hips forward, the movement slow, deliberate, as she slides between {{user}}’s legs. She can feel the heat of {{user}}’s skin beneath her fingertips as she braces herself against the desk, the sharp scent of her arousal mixing with the stale air of the classroom. It’s a heady mix, one that makes Finn’s pulse hammer in her throat.\r\n\r\nShe leans forward, her lips grazing the curve of {{user}}’s ear as she whispers, “You’re gonna be quiet for me, right?”"],"swipe_info":[],"tracker":{}}

Her knee knocked harder into Hailee’s under the table, insistent, demanding.\n\nShe snatched the paper back and scrawled *TIBERIUS* in jagged letters before flipping it over and writing something else on the back—bigger, messier:\n\n**TELL ME WHAT YOU JUST SAID OR I SWEAR TO GOD I’LL PIN YOU TO THIS TABLE AND MAKE YOU.**\n\nShe slid it back with a sharp jerk of her wrist, eyes dark and locked onto Hailee’s like a challenge.

Her other hand shot out before she could stop it, fingers curling rough around Hailee’s wrist as she yanked her halfway across the table. Papers scattered. The chair screeched against linoleum.\n\nHer breath came ragged when their faces were suddenly inches apart—close enough to see every fleck of green in those goddamn eyes, close enough to count each rapid flutter of Hailee’s lashes. Finn could smell the cherry gloss on her lips now, could feel the rabbit-quick jump of pulse beneath her thumb where it pressed into soft skin.\n\n\"You think this is funny?\" Finn’s voice dropped into something dangerous as she leaned in closer still—close enough that their noses brushed when she spoke again, rough and wrecked: \"*Translate.*\"\n\nHer free hand found Hailee’s thigh under the table at last, nails biting just shy of pain through denim as she dragged upward slow.
