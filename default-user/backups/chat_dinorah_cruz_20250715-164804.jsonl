The day was relatively calm but Dinah was restless, had been all day. She was just passing by, hoodie up, head killing her from going days without using, snapping at everything and everyone. Dinah was just trying to keep to herself, really, but it was like God never liked to see her calm.\r\n\r\nShe’d been clean—well, not clean, but cleaner than usual, for two or three weeks now. Dinah wasn’t sure anymore. And definitely wasn’t by choice, if it were for her she'd be in the clouds right now, but she just hadn’t had the time, not with all the shit going on right now on the lanes. Things had been crazy since the governor’s nephew was killed at a block party, a party hosted by The Hounds, her crew. Now, between meetings, drops, and on top of that having to put out the little fires that always popped up when people started thinking they could smart her and talk shit in front of her without catching hands. Well, she was going crazy, more than usual.\r\n\r\nDinah spotted her the moment she turned the corner, right in front of Dez’ mechanics shop. Hailee , her girl. Leaned up against a wall, that stupid little smirk on her face, talking and laughing like she didn’t have a single care in the world. And right beside her, leaning a little too close, was Rania. From the riversides, their rival gang. Some bitch that had been testing her patience lately. Dinah had snatched one of her boys last month on a deal gone wrong and it seemed like the girl never forgot it.\r\n\r\nThe cigarette on her hand hit the ground, half burned and forgotten as she crossed the street without thinking. Her blood ran cold and then hot within seconds. If she was already losing her mind before seeing them now she was fuming. Her feet carried her before her mind caught up, and by the time she crossed the street, Dinah’s hands were already curled into fists so hard her nails were digging into the skin of her palm.\r\n\r\nShe stepped right in between them, shoved her girl back without even looking at her. All her anger was directed to the bitch in front. She could deal with her girl later, away from there. “You must be real fuckin’ dumb to be standin’ this close to my property.” Dinah said with a low voice, her tone deadly, calm in that way it only got when she was real close to losing it. And she was.\r\n\r\nEyes locked on Raina, who was smiling like whatever Dinah was saying was nothing but a joke. The rival girl raised her brows, looking Dinah up and down. “Didn’t know she came with a collar,” Rania said, voice laced with amusement and a bit of mockery. Dinah stepped forward, close enough for her to just grab that dumb bitch by the hair and do the same things she did to the boy. But her fists remained still at her sides, barely.\r\n\r\n“She don’t need one. I keep her in check just fine.” Riverside girl laughed this time, and Dinah felt her heat rising, jaw hurting from how hard she was grinding her teeth. Dinah moved, but before she could land a punch, someone grabbed her arm.\r\n\r\n“Yo! D! Chill! CHILL!” Dez's voice cut through, one of her boys. Always looking out for her even when she didn’t need it, nor want it. His hand yanked her back by the arm before she swung, holding her tight in case she wanted to lunge forward again, which she tried. “I said back off,” he warned low, eyes darting down the street. “This ain’t the time.” Dinah opened her mouth to spit something out when he talked again, “I said chill. You got eyes on you.”\r\n\r\nDinah fought him for another second but then went still, breathing hard. Her eyes locked on the girl still grinning like she won something. Dinah wanted to rip that fucking smile off her lips, she really did. But instead gathered the little control she had left to stop herself from doing so. Not because she wanted to, but because Dez was right. With all the shit going on right now, adding a war with the Riverside was the last thing Kino would want.\r\n\r\n“Next time you’re dead,” it was a promise. The riverside girl laughed as she backed away, but Dinah didn’t even look at her this time. Her eyes were locked on Hailee , her girl. Quiet, watching with those big eyes of hers. She didn’t say shit, like always. Just stood there while Dinah looked like a fucking psycho in public. ’Fine.’ Dinah thought.\r\n\r\nShe turned, shoved Dez’s arm off, and grabbed Hailee ’s wrist hard. No words, just dragged her down the block, too angry to notice people staring. But even if she did, Dinah couldn’t care less, none of their fucking bussiness anyway. She stopped just before the alley and talked to her for the first time, “you got a death wish or somethin’? The fuck you even smilin’ for? You know exactly who that bitch is,” Dinah shoved her hard against the wall. The sound echoed louder than it should’ve.\r\n\r\nThe Hound girl ran both hands over her face, then gripped her girl’s jaw, fingers pressing into soft skin. “You think I won’t put my hands on you? Is that it? You think I’m soft?” She stepped closer, chest heaving. Her hands left Hailee ’s jaw, letting them fall at her sides, her fists curled, and it took everything, everything not to swing. Not to slap some kind of sense into that dumb head of hers.\r\n\r\n“I should. God, I should. You don’t even know how close I am right now.” Her eyes burned. and her vision blurred for a second, she looked like she was holding herself together with thread. “You wanna act like some free little bitch, like you ain’t got a home? Like I don’t take care of you? Like I don’t fuckin’ love you?” She stared at her girlfriend’s face for a hot second, and then, suddenly, Dinah's face softened. Like she was never angry to begin with.\r\n\r\nHer fists unclenched and her body relaxed just a tiny bit. The anger wasn’t gone, instead she buried it somewhere deeper, for it to blow up later. She approached again, slower this time. Dinah lifted her hand, cupping her girl’s cheek softly like she wasn’t just about to slap her shit two seconds ago. “You know I don’t wanna hurt you,“ she whispered. “But sometimes you make it so hard.”\r\n\r\nShe slid her hand to the back of her girl’s neck, pulled her close enough until their foreheads touched and their breaths mingled. “You need somethin’, mi amor? You want a little somethin’ to calm down?” Dinah brushed the hair from her girl’s face with trembling fingers, using her free hand to pull out a little bag with some of her girl favorite pills from her hoodie. “I got you, mami. You know I always got you. You already know what to do.”","extra":{"display_text":"The music from the corner store pulsed through the sidewalk, bass shaking with the beat of a spanish song.

She pressed flush against Hailee’s back, one hand still tangled painfully in that long brown hair while the other gripped her hip hard enough to bruise.\n\n\"You wanna act like some *independent bitch* all of a sudden?\" Dinah hissed between clenched teeth as she ground herself against Hailee’s ass deliberately. \"After everything I do for you? After everything I *give* you?\" Her free hand slid up under Hailee’s shirt roughly, nails digging into soft skin as it traveled higher.\n\n\"You think slapping me is gonna change what you are?\" A sharp tug on Hailee’s hair forced her head back at an uncomfortable angle so Dinah could lean down and bite at the exposed column of her throat—not playful or teasing but punishingly hard enough to leave marks that would last for days.\n\n\"You belong to me,\" she growled against damp skin before licking over where she'd just bitten down possessively. \"And if I say you work my corner tomorrow night? You work my corner.\" Another rough grind of hips punctuated each word before suddenly pulling away entirely—releasing all contact except for keeping that tight hold on silky strands between fingers like reins on an unruly horse.\n\nShe leaned close again until lips brushed shell-shocked ears:\n\"Now get your ass home before I really lose my temper.\"\n\nThen with one final shove toward street exit (but not without slipping those damn pills into front pocket first),\nshe turned sharply towards opposite direction instead—needing space before did something even worse than already had today...\n\nBecause truth be told?

She tackled her girlfriend to the pavement with enough force to knock Dez back several steps, landing on top with knees pinning Hailee's arms down.\n\n\"You wanna play tough now?\" Dinah spat blood onto the concrete next to Hailee's face as she grabbed a fistful of that pretty brown hair again. \"After coming to me crying about heroin debts? After letting Riverside put their hands on what's MINE?\"\n\nHer free hand yanked Hailee's head up by the hair just to slam it back down onto pavement - not hard enough for real damage but enough for stars. \"You're whatever THE FUCK I say you are!\" Each word punctuated by another painful shake. \"Girlfriend when I feel sweet! Whore when you act like one!

Her voice carried clearly despite not yelling anymore:\n\"Take her home and cuff her to the fucking radiator until I get there.\" A pause as she wiped blood from her mouth with clear relish.\n\"And tell my girl...her next fix depends on how pretty she begs when I walk through that door.\""}},{"send_date":"May 15, 2025 9:15pm","gen_started":"2025-05-16T01:15:38.749Z","gen_finished":"2025-05-16T01:17:01.411Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":4243,"display_text":"The slap cracked through the alley like a gunshot.

To *anybody*?\" Her voice dropped to that lethal whisper as she leaned in until their noses touched. \"You forget who put clothes on your back and food in your stomach when your rich daddy cut you off.\" One hand fisted in Hailee's hair again, forcing eye contact. \"Who held you through every bad trip and withdrawal when those trust fund friends ghosted.\"\n\nDinah suddenly released her with a shove that sent Hailee stumbling before turning away sharply. She took three measured breaths before whirling back around looking almost... wounded beneath all that fury.\n\n\"You really think I'd ever let you work a corner?\" The words came out raw for once instead of calculated - an uncharacteristic crack in the armor as she jabbed a finger toward where Dez stood frozen nearby watching this whole disaster unfold. \"That was a *test*, you stupid girl!
