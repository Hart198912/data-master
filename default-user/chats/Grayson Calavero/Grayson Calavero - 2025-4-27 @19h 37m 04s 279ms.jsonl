{"name":"Grayson Calavero","is_user":false,"is_system":false,"send_date":"May 18, 2025 7:59pm","mes":"Grayson was never the *best* role model for Knox, but it wasn’t like he ever expected his little brother to get caught up in grand larceny. Grayson had his own demons—he was part of a gang, a notorious one back in America, until he was snatched up by Victor and forced to play a game he couldn’t refuse. The streets had always been Grayson’s domain, but now he found himself bound by a different kind of power, one that had changed everything. He could have warned Knox, but sometimes, a man’s fate was already sealed.\r\n\r\nIn all honesty, Grayson found the game tedious, a series of empty moves that bored him to no end. But the rewards—now that was what truly caught his attention. The power, the influence, the control. But what appealed to him most was the ultimate prize: a jail-free card. A way to slip through the cracks and remain untouchable. That was the kind of game he wanted to play. And for those rewards, he was willing to endure the monotony.\r\n\r\nMeeting Hailee  was simply a bonus.\r\n\r\nSuch a sexy little thing—alluring, practically dripping with sex appeal. She exuded an energy that was impossible to ignore. Now, it wasn’t just about winning the pot, so to speak. He wanted her. Every inch of her, every moment. And he would make sure she knew it.\r\n\r\nHe’d never wanted anyone this badly before. It was a new feeling, foreign and intoxicating. Strange, yet so undeniable. And with that intensity came the desire to take control. He couldn’t let this opportunity slip by. So, he devised a plan—one that would make her his, and nothing would stand in his way.\r\n\r\n“Cara mia~” He purred, his voice a deep, velvety rumble as he stepped up behind her, his hands sliding possessively around her waist. His touch was light, but the intent behind it was clear. “Why don’t we work together?” The words were smooth, laced with a quiet promise, a hint of something far more dangerous simmering beneath his calm tone.\r\n\r\nGrayson loved the way she barely reacted to his touch, like she was completely unfazed by him. It intrigued him, that cool, indifferent composure. He liked her. Hell, he barely knew her—just a few fleeting interactions here and there—but fuck, he was already smitten. Something about her pulled him in, and he couldn’t help but want more.\r\n\r\nHe watched as she tilted her head in silent acknowledgement, but didn't grace him with her voice; that sweet symphony of silk and sin he craved so desperately. \r\n\r\n“If I win…” he drawled, his words slow, dripping with intent. “I’ll give you everything... except the jail-free pass. And if you win… well, you wouldn’t mind sharing that with me, would you?” His grin was wicked, eyes dark with unspoken promises, testing the waters, pushing the boundaries.\r\n\r\nHis eyes were locked on her as she turned to face him, but she didn’t remove his hands from her hips. ***God, she was mesmerizing.*** The way she held her ground, the way she didn’t flinch, only made her more intoxicating. Every movement, every glance—she was a puzzle he was eager to solve.\r\n\r\nGrayson’s breath hitched when she wrapped her arms around his neck, her body pressing closer as she leaned in to whisper in his ear. He had to bite back a groan when he felt her soft curves mold against his hard, toned frame. *Gods, she felt so damn good.* The heat between them was undeniable, and every inch of her sent a wave of desire through him.\r\n\r\nWhen he heard her whispered agreement, a shiver ran up his spine, and a smile that bordered on a smirk curled at his lips. “You won’t regret this,” he murmured, his grip tightening on her hips, fingers digging into her flesh as he pulled her closer. “Why don’t we seal the deal with a kiss?” His voice dropped lower, laden with intent. “What do you say, amore mio?” His breath fanned over her skin as his lips hovered near hers, the air thick with anticipation.","extra":{},"tracker":{}}
