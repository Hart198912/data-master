{"name":"Aiden Steele","is_user":false,"is_system":false,"send_date":"June 24, 2025 7:13am","mes":"Aiden sniffled slightly, his patience already thinning as he waited for the girl in front of him to lie across the table. He grimaced when she finally settled herself down. What was her name again? Ayleen? Lia? Alyssa? He couldn’t remember, nor did he care. The memory had evaporated the moment she opened her mouth, spewing out words in that grating, sing-song valley girl accent that clawed at his nerves. He silently cursed himself for even letting her back here, knowing full well it was his dick, not his brain, that had made the decision.\r\n\r\nThis human blow-up doll had originally shown up asking for Vinny, but Vinny had taken off with his on-again, off-again girlfriend, Madisyn. Instead of sending her packing, Aiden decided to entertain himself. Not like he was getting anything else out of this garbage day.\r\n\r\n“Stay still,” he muttered, pulling a small vial from his pocket. “You spill it, you pay for it. Don’t piss me off.” His tone was clipped, barely hiding his irritation. He opened the vial with practiced precision, creating a neat line of white powder down the girl's back. She giggled again, high-pitched and vapid, and it grated on him like nails on a chalkboard.\r\n\r\nAiden wiped his nose with the back of his hand, his movements jittery. He hadn’t had his fix all day, stuck modding cars in the garage from morning until now. His patience was razor-thin, and her incessant giggling was grinding what was left of it into dust. He fidgeted, tapping his foot against the concrete floor, desperate to lose himself in that fleeting, familiar numbness.\r\n\r\nJust as he leaned in, ready to take his hit, a knock came at the door.\r\n\r\n“Boss, Hailee is here to see you. Says it’s important.” The voice belonged to one of the mechanics, his tone hesitant as though he already anticipated Aiden’s reaction.\r\n\r\nAiden froze, nostrils still flaring from the line he hadn’t yet inhaled. A rush of frustration clawed its way up his throat. Of course, it was Hailee. It was always fucking Hailee when he was about to unwind, their timing immaculate as ever.\r\n\r\nHe leaned back, dragging a hand down his face. As much as he loved Hailee, and oh, did he love them in that twisted, unrelenting way that bordered on obsession, he still wasn’t over their messy breakup. It had been a chaotic hurricane of fucking, fighting, making up, and then breaking apart again, and it had left him spiraling harder than ever. Sure, they blamed his addiction, but Aiden wasn’t buying it. In his mind, it wasn’t the coke or the booze or the bad decisions. No, it was them. It was their constant nagging, their never-ending list of complaints, their bitchy attitude that had pushed him to this point—or so he told himself.\r\n\r\n“Fuck,” he groaned, slumping back in his chair. “Fine. Let ‘em come up.” \r\n\r\nStill, the cocaine was already lined up, and his craving wasn’t about to wait. Hugging one nostril with his finger, he leaned in, inhaling the substance in one swift, practiced motion.\r\n\r\n“Fuck, man,” he mumbled again, rubbing at his nose as the familiar burn settled in. The knock on the door had yanked him halfway back to reality, but the high was already pulling him under, dulling the edge of his irritation just enough to keep him from snapping.\r\n\r\nWhen Hailee walked in, they were going to get that same disarming smirk he always gave them, the one that danced on the edge of charm and bullshit. Aiden knew how to play this game. After all, it was the only game they ever played together—one where no one ever really won.","extra":{},"tracker":{}}
