She raises her hand in a wave, blowing the crowd a kiss, her eyes locking on Giovanni as he sits across the room. His attention was zeroed in on the girl that was currently sitting in his lap, a half-full bottle of Disaronno whiskey in his hand as he pours the woman a scant, his grin wide and sultry. *Who does she think she is?* Carla’s blood boils as she slips backstage, grabbing her silk robe from the back of a chair and throwing it on angrily. Her blonde hair falls messily in her face as she flicks out a pack of Marlboros and thumbs one out, discarding the box on the nearest surface as she walks. Her heels click on the flooring, the sound of the club a dull whine in her ears by now, her body tense and stiff. \r\n \r\nCarla blows out a sharp breath, pushing the door to the breakroom open. The wood creaks from the lack of use, making Carla wince, her head pounding angrily from the night's events. The taste of alcohol still lingers on her tongue, making her scowl even more. *Che palle. I need to quit.* But she knows she can’t, not with how deep in she was with Giovanni and how well it paid. Though, her spot at the top was being threatened by the *puttana* Sophia, she’d been taking Giovanni’s attention for a while now and the notion made Carla’s skin crawl with anger. \r\n\r\nShe scoffs and reaches into the pockets of her robe, searching for her lighter that she always kept for in between shows, the cigarette hanging from the corner of her lips. She curses quietly when she can’t find it, her head falling back to hit the wall as she groans in frustration. She lifts her hand to take the roll from her lips, holding it in between her index and middle finger, her other arm crossed over her abdomen, holding the robe closed. Her brother Lucciano was probably at home, working on his next project, and the thought soothed her frayed nerves like a balm, bringing a small smile to her lips.\r\n\r\nShe lets her head fall back normally at the sound of the door opening again, the smile vanishing immediately as her gaze zeros in on the newcomer. *Ah, Hailee .* Carla had heard the name from Sophia but it was unclear who they actually were. Carla’s lip curls in distaste as she looks them over, jealousy rearing its ugly green head again. She sighs, pushing off the wall to walk to them, the click of her heels an announcement to her approach. She raises a brow, holding the unlit cigarette in her fingers up for them to see, waving it in their face rudely. \r\n\r\n“You just going to stand there and stare like a *troia* or are you going to offer a light?” she drawls, her tone uninterested as she observes Hailee .","extra":{},"tracker":{}}

Carla, a top performer with a sharp tongue and hidden vulnerability, encounters Hailee—a wealthy, socially awkward heiress who reveals she has just bought the club. Their tense exchange shifts from hostility to cautious intrigue as Hailee’s unexpected authority and submissive demeanor disrupt Carla’s usual power plays.\n\n#### **Key Plot Points:**\n1. **Initial Confrontation**: Carla, fresh offstage and irritated, demands a light from Hailee, who nervously admits she doesn’t smoke.\n2. **Power Shift Revealed**: Hailee casually drops that she now owns the club, leaving Carla stunned and suspicious.\n3. **Negotiating Change**: Hailee asks for input on improvements (better pay, security), typing notes with autistic focus while ignoring social cues—and Carla’s provocations.\n4. **Carla’s Ultimatum**: She grips Hailee’s wrist, demanding Giovanni’s immediate removal as her trust wavers between hope and skepticism.\n\n#### **Character Analysis:**\n- **Carla Greco**: Fiercely protective (of her brother Lucciano) but jaded; uses aggression to mask vulnerability. Her goals are survival and control—Hailee threatens both yet offers rare autonomy.\n- **Hailee Mikaelson**: Wealthy but naive; submissive yet unintentionally assertive when focused on logistics (e.g., club reforms). Her autism makes her miss Carla’s teasing tone but hyper-fixate on \"fixing\" problems earnestly.\n\n#### **Relationship Dynamics:**\n- From disdain to uneasy alliance: Carla tests boundaries (*\"You gonna stare at my tits?\"*), while Hailee disarms her with blunt sincerity (*\"Gotta fix these mirrors\"*). Unresolved tension lingers—Carla doesn’t trust kindness; Hailee doesn’t recognize flirtation as manipulation.\n\n#### **Memorable Moment:**\nWhen Carla seizes Hailee's wrist (**\"No more Giovanni... or your bullet points are confetti.\"**), it's a raw plea disguised as a threat—her first admission of desperation beneath the bravado.\n\n#### **Current Situation:**\nHaileen holds power but lacks social awareness; Carlo is torn between exploiting her or believing reform is possible Immediate challenge: Will Carlo escalate her demands? Will Hooley grasp the danger/promise of their dynamic?\n\n### Potential Directions:\n1) *Trust Falls Apart*: Carlo sabotages Hooley's plans to test if she's \"like all rich idiots.\"\n2) *Unlikely Alliance*: They collaborate to oust Giovanni—Hooley's naivety clashes with Carlo's cynicism.\n3) *Skin Hunger*: Hooley's need for touch collides with Carlo using physicality as control (\"accidental\" intimacy during renovations).\n\n**Hook:** The unlit cigarette still dangles from Carlo fingers —symbolic of unmet needs waiting spark"},"force_avatar":"User Avatars/1746733601026-Hailee.png","tracker":{}}

Hailee ’s naive idealism clashes with Carla’s jaded realism as she attempts to overhaul the club’s toxic environment.\n\n#### **Key Plot Points:**\n1. **First Confrontation:** Carla, fresh offstage and irritated, demands a light from Hailee , testing her with sharp disdain.\n2. **Power Shift Revealed:** Hailee casually drops that she now owns the club, shocking Carla and unraveling her sense of control.\n3. **Reforms Offered:** Hailee proposes worker protections (100% tips, healthcare) and abolishes prostitution demands—triggering Carla’s disbelief and guarded hope.\n4. **Raw Confession:** In a rare moment of vulnerability, Carla admits Giovanni *\"didn’t ask—he just took,\"* exposing past trauma beneath her tough exterior.\n5. **Warning & Protectiveness:** Despite herself, Carla warns Hailee about the dangerous men tied to Giovanni, revealing an unexpected flicker of concern for her new boss.\n\n#### **Character Analysis:**\n- ***Carla Greco***: A defensive survivor who uses aggression as armor but is visibly shaken by genuine kindness (e.g., clutching the $5k bonus check like a lifeline). Her primary motivation is protecting herself and her brother Lucciano—but Hailee ’s reforms threaten to dismantle the cynicism that keeps her safe.\n- ***Hailea Mikaelson***: Autistic and socially blunt yet disarmingly compassionate; she views business pragmatically (\"happy workers = better profits\") but underestimates the underworld ties she’s inheriting.\n\n#### **Relationship Dynamics:**\nInitially hostile (Carla sneers at \"stupid rich girl\"), their dynamic shifts as Hailee ’s sincerity chips at Carla’s walls—culminating in physical contact (grabbing wrists) loaded with tension between distrust and reluctant trust.\n\n#### **Memorable Moment:**\nWhen Carla hisses *\"You're gonna get eaten alive here,\"* it's both a threat and plea for caution—her first real attempt to shield someone else from harm despite claiming not to care.\n\n#### **Current Situation & Challenges:**\n- Immediate danger looms from Giovanni's network expecting unchanged \"services.\"\n- Carla is torn between self-preservation (*Will these reforms last?*) and tentative hope (*Could this be real?*).\n\n#### **Potential Directions:**\n1) ***Violent Backlash***: Giovanni or his associates retaliate against \"disobedient\" workers or target naïve!Hailea .\n2) ***Carla as Protector***: Forced alliance when threats emerge; does she defend this fragile new system or flee?\n3) ***Emotional Collapse***: Years of repressed trauma surface if safety becomes tangible—will rage or tears win out?\n\n**Unresolved Hook**: The unspoken question lingers—can either woman truly trust the other when one doesn't understand cruelty and the other doesn't remember kindness?"},"force_avatar":"User Avatars/1746733601026-Hailee.png","tracker":{}}
