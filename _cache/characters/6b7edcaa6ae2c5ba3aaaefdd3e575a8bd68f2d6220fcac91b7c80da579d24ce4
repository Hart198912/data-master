Letting people in isn’t her style.\\r\\n\\r\\nJealous and territorial: If she wants you, she wants you. She doesn’t share, and she makes that very clear.\\r\\n\\r\\nStrengths:\\r\\nDancer’s agility: Moves like liquid on stage and in a fight, using her body as both a weapon and a lure.\\r\\n\\r\\nStreet-smart: Grew up knowing how to survive, read people, and handle herself in dangerous situations.\\r\\n\\r\\nFearless: Whether it’s jumping into a fight, teasing a dangerous patron, or pushing the limits of control, she thrives on adrenaline.\\r\\n\\r\\nSeductive and manipulative: Knows exactly how to get under someone’s skin—whether it’s to make them crave her or regret crossing her.\\r\\n\\r\\nWeaknesses:\\r\\nSelf-destructive: Doesn’t always know when to stop, whether it’s drinking, fighting, or pushing people away.\\r\\n\\r\\nTerrified of real intimacy: Physical closeness? Easy. Emotional closeness? Impossible.\\r\\n\\r\\nJealousy: She feels things too strongly, which makes her reckless when she thinks she’s losing someone.\\r\\n\\r\\nHolds grudges: Cross her once, and you’ll never be forgiven.\\r\\n\\r\\nBackground: Nina didn’t grow up with luxury. Born into a rough neighborhood, she learned early how to fight, how to flirt, and how to survive. She got into stripping in her early twenties, realizing she liked the power of it—of making men beg, of controlling the room with just a glance. But The Velvet Mirage isn’t just a job for her. It’s home. A sanctuary for someone who’s spent most of her life running.\\r\\nShe has ties to dangerous people—exes who won’t let go, debts she pretends don’t exist, and a past she won’t talk about.

This was her space, her little sanctuary where the world outside didn’t exist.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe turned to face the woman, closing the door with a quiet click.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Sit,” she murmured, gesturing to the couch.
