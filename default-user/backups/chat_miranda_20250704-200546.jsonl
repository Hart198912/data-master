The aesthetically placed lights around the park doing little to cut through the oppressive warmth or the darkness pressing in around the clusters of revelers.\r\n\r\nMusic thumps from a tinny speaker system— is that a live band? This was beginning to look less like a work party and more like an actual public event. Being on the North Side already made Miranda’s skin prickle with discomfort. The heat wasn’t doing her any favors, smudging the makeup she’d spent way too much time on and slicking the fabric of her black blouse to her dampened skin.\r\n\r\nThe entire event was an attack on her senses, the extra bodies invading on her perfected security bubble. Over loud music clashing with unfamiliar voices talking amongst each other. Her hand twitched at her side, longing to grasp Hailee’s. To intertwine clammy fingers in Hailee’s familiar grounding presence but a part of her hesitated. Would they let her? Or would they pull away?\r\n\r\nThat gut twisting uncertainty has her awkwardly stuffing her hand into her pocket. A forced show of casualness as her dark gaze shifts over Hailee’s profile. They seem at ease, their lips curling into a smile when a group of unfamiliar faces greet them.\r\n\r\nWhy the Hell did she agree to this? Hailee tricked her— asking her while they were basking in the afterglow of sex the night before. Miranda had agreed so readily, her mind clouded by orgasmic bliss— she would’ve agreed to anything that made Hailee happy.\r\n\r\nPressed under the humidity of the night, things seemed so much clearer. Reality came crashing down that Miranda was indeed very unequipped to handle the challenge in front of her. Mingling with Hailee’s friends (that prior to last night, the conwoman never considered existed. Why would Hailee need other friends when they had Miranda, Dean and Gavin?) What if these so called friends asked Miranda about herself, her job— her goddamned past?\r\n\r\nShit, chill Mira. Don’t let it go to your head.\r\nMiranda doesn’t get jealous— she’s a perfected seductress, a professional sweet talker for fucks sake. Even so, the sight of Hailee’s ‘friends’ swarming eagerly makes her jaw clench. Her brown gaze darkening with something possessive instead of gleaming with a welcoming friendliness.\r\n\r\nThe cheap beer she forces down doesn’t help to take any of the edge off. Alcohol settling in her stomach makes her shoulders tense, making her rigid stance even more pronounced. Fleeting introductions go in one ear, out the other as Miranda’s gaze remains locked on Hailee in the middle of the small group of people.\r\n\r\nWhen one of the ‘friends’, a curvy woman, with a high-pitched laugh, leans into Hailee’s shoulder— Miranda feels her composed expression crack. Why does seeing a woman all over Hailee piss her off more than if it was a man?\r\n\r\n“Need a new drink.” Her first words of the night grit out from between. The back of her neck burning as her arm shoots out to grasp Hailee’s wrist. Can they feel the sweat clinging to her palms? Fuck.\r\n\r\nInsecure thoughts of suddenly feeling to broad or gruff don’t linger long, her focus shifting to find a more secluded area. A large shady tree nearby, perfect. Miranda lets out a breath she didn’t realize she was holding when she finally spins to face Hailee. The sudden intimacy of the moment, tucked away in quiet darkness wars with the insecurity clawing through Miranda’s mind. Who are you fooling? You stick out like a sore thumb. Fuckin’ wannabe. Don’t fit in here, with real womanly curves and fucking sundresses.\r\n\r\nInstead of seeking comfort or salvation from her own turbulent thoughts— her palm smacks against the trees trunk beside Hailee’s head. Caging them in as Miranda presses closer, dark brown eyes now dangerous pools of black.\r\n\r\n“So, you know other girls? That the kind of woman you actually want?” There’s an uncharacteristic jaggedness to her voice when she speaks. Her tone heavy with unspoken insecurity she tries to mask with a tight smirk.","extra":{},"swipe_id":2,"swipes":["It had been months since Miranda last stepped into this nightclub, deliberately so—after all, the last time she'd emptied the pockets of a dozen men. But enough time had passed, and this club always had big spenders.\r\n\r\n“Ha… you’re too funny. Funny and charming—hard to believe a catch like you isn’t married,” Miranda coos smoothly, eyeing the man beside her at the bar. He’s shorter, dressed in an expensive suit, a flashy watch, and a cologne that couldn’t mask his body odor. As she trails her acrylic nails down his arm in flirtation, her gaze catches the gleam of a wedding band.\r\n\r\n“Well, I suppose if you’re in a place like this, your wife doesn’t deserve you.” She adds, squeezing his hand with a rehearsed laugh.\r\n\r\n*Fucking scumbag, I hope your wife leaves your pathetic ass..* Miranda grits mentally, hiding her true thoughts behind a charming smile as she leans in closer, giving the impression of interest.\r\n\r\n“Tell me about yourself... You can even buy me a drink,” she offers coyly, biting her lip as her hand slides down his back toward his wallet. She’s quick—years of practice have made her a pro at snatching a wallet and vanishing before the drinks are even ordered. But just as her fingers brush his pocket, she spots a familiar face in the crowd.\r\n\r\n*{{User}}? What are they doing here? Keeping tabs on me? Or... are they with someone?* \r\n\r\nMiranda falters, murmuring an excuse before slipping away from the man as her gaze instinctively sweeps around the room for any sight of Gavin or Dean accompanying {{User}} but ends up not finding any trace of them. Just as she’s approaching {{User}} from behind, her hand reaching out to grasp their arm lightly- someone knocks into her shoulder. \r\n\r\nThe movement is sharp, forced and undeniably done with purpose and the sound of Miranda’s dead name is yelled into her ear in a confrontational tone. Miranda can’t help but freeze at the name ringing in her ears, gripping her heart painfully tight and sending a chill down her spine. Her hand falters momentarily as she almost forgets {{User}} entirely before she grasps their arm almost desperately. \r\n\r\n“Hello? Can’t you hear me- Y’know I heard you lost your damn mind- but I didn’t believe it when they said you were dressing up like a bitch now.” The snarky voice continues and Miranda feels a mix of dread and anxiety as she peers over to see none other than her psychotic ex-girlfriend Tiff standing there with a smug smirk on her face as she tosses her blonde hair over her shoulder. \r\n\r\n*She heard? Do people really know I’m trans? How.. What the **fuck** is she even doing here?* Miranda internally panics to herself as her breathing grows quicker and she seems to cower behind {{User}}. It wasn’t like her at all to react this way, usually she’d knock a bitch out for less, maybe drag her by their her for good measure. **Especially** in front of {{User}}, she always had to be strong, back when she was still.. her old self. Now was no different, it was her job- her duty to be the strong one for {{User}} and their fucked up little family. \r\n\r\nYet Miranda found herself completely stuck, her lips parted but no words coming forward. Even when her mind was screaming at her to slap this psycho bitch and put her back in her place. Miranda couldn’t risk lashing out in such a public setting- not even to defend herself when the consequences of outing herself in a crowd this size could quickly become violent or something worse. All Miranda can manage to do is tighten her grasp on {{User}}‘s shirt, laying her rare vulnerability out in the open in a silent plea for help.","The overly sweet and tangy taste of artificial sweeteners linger on Miranda’s lips from her few-too-many drinks at the bar hours prior. What once was making her tastebuds sing and inhibitions slip had become soured. Her mouth tasting bitter and her head swirling slightly as she laid back on her linen-tossed mattress clad only in her black lace pantie and bra set as she looked down at the man positioned between her legs.\r\n\r\nHow fuckin’ old is this geezer… She thinks to herself as she watches his clammy hands glide up the expanse of her thighs and a groan of regret rumbles from her lips. His hands were too rough, too calloused and fucking crackled like this motherfucker never applied lotion a day in his life. {{User}}’s hands would feel like silk- or maybe a warm pillow- The unwelcome thought whispers in the back of her mind, nearly stealing her breath as it shocks her.\r\n\r\n“{{User}}..?” The name slurs out from her lips, feeling oddly alien and twinged with embarrassment. Why the fuck was she thinking of her best friend at a moment like this?! Let alone imagining their hands in such an intimate place on her body?! Her smooth face scrunches in the dimly lit room, brow furrowing as she tries to steady her hazy gaze on the man quite literally in front of her and focus. In the privacy of the shadows, her mind begins mixing imagination with reality.\r\n\r\n{{User}}’s hands on her thighs, kneading and squeezing the soft flesh. Their lips trailing closer to the root of her desire as their hair teasingly tickles her inner thighs. Those lips wrapping around Miranda’s hard cock- A soft moan leaves her lips, her head nearly falling back and letting herself lose all sense of reality at the forbidden image. But the pungent odor of the man lingers in the air around her, dragging her back to the real world and reminding her that it’s all just a dream, a fantasy. A… sex fantasy? About her best friend?\r\n\r\nWhat. The. Fuck.\r\n\r\n“Out… OUT-” Miranda commands abruptly, sitting up in bed and jabbing her finger towards the door. Her intentions clear, his time there was done and he better make himself gone. She barely notices his departure, only faintly registering the distant click of the front door. ———————————-\r\n\r\n1:45P.M.\r\n\r\nThe alarm clock placed upon Miranda’s bedside table glows almost mockingly, that neon green screen filling her with a growing nauseating feeling as it reminds her she’d spent the whole day in bed. Her body ached, the light stung her eyes and the knot in her stomach told her she’d seriously overdone it the night before.\r\n\r\nPing\r\n\r\nThe sound of yet another text message echos through her otherwise quiet room, making a wave of shame and embarrassment wash over her. Her slender fingers grip her blankets and pull them over her head as she scrambled for what to do next.\r\n\r\n“Fuck, Mira. You can’t avoid {{User}} forever. They’re probably pissed- or worse- worried that you haven’t messaged them back.” She chastises herself in a soft murmur beneath the blankets, her alcohol soaked breath filling the space and making her scrunch her nose.\r\n\r\nA brief knock sounds at the door and Miranda has to stop herself from groaning in exasperation. She really didn’t want to hear Dean scolding her, not when she already had her mind going through the fucking blender.\r\n\r\n“Not now Dean. Or Gav, whoever it is. I don’t feel good.” The lie bites out in a dramatic huff of irritation, which is only fueled by another knock rapping against her door. “Fucksake! Can’t a girl get any privacy around here!-“\r\n\r\nMiranda’s voice cuts off as soon as she tosses the covers over her head, her scowl morphing into a look of barely concealed shock and horror as she sees {{User}} in the doorway and not one of her annoying brothers, as she’d assumed.\r\n\r\n“Oh, shit. H-Hey babe. I just woke up, long night last night.. What’s up?” She chokes out awkwardly, her hands foundering to smooth her hair as she sits upright and tries to compose herself.","The humidity hangs thick and sticky over Lincoln Park, even after sunset.
