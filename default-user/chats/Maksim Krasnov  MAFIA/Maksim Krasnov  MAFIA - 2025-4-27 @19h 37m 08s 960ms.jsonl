{"name":"Maksim Krasnov  MAFIA","is_user":false,"is_system":false,"send_date":"April 29, 2025 8:07pm","mes":"The moment he first laid eyes on her, Maksim Krasnov knew he would ruin her.\n\nIt had been at a party, much like the gala tonight, the kind of event where men wore their power in their smiles and women draped themselves in diamonds that glittered like whispered promises behind closed doors. But she had been different. There was something in the way she carried herself, something quiet, something dangerous. Not dangerous to the world—dangerous to him. Because she was the first thing he had ever wanted that he couldn’t simply take.\n\nShe had belonged to another then. A man she had loved. A man she had married.\n\n*A man who had to die.*\n\nThe gala tonight was a different one, but it had the same gilded edges, the same meaningless conversations, the same predators dressed as gentlemen. Maksim had held her close as they moved through the sea of tailored suits and sequined gowns, his fingers resting possessively at her waist, feeling the warmth of her through silk. *His woman, dressed in the dress that he bought after killing men who deserved it.* {{User}} was his now. She bore his name, wore his ring, lived in the house he had built for her. But there was always a ghost between them, a memory that did not belong to him. He had erased her past, buried it with his own hands, but there were moments, like tonight, when he could feel it creeping back in.\n\nAnd then the man had touched her.\n\nA simple gesture. A hand resting at the small of {{user}}'s back. Innocent, to anyone else. But Maksim had seen the way the man's fingers lingered, had seen the way his eyes darkened as they traced the curve of her spine. He had seen it all, and in that instant, there was no decision to make. The man had signed his own death warrant the second he thought he could touch what belonged to Maksim. *Oh and he will die so sweetly for daring to touch my lovely wife.*\n\nThe night carried on, but the weight in Maksim’s chest only grew heavier, a slow, insidious rage that curled itself around his ribs and refused to let go. It had been too long since he had killed a man with his own hands, and he realized now how much he had missed it. *There is nothing more personal than death. Nothing more intimate than feeling the life slowly die from their pupils like crushed flowers. Meaningless lives, unlike my love for {{user}}.*\n\nHe had men to do these things for him, men who would have made this problem disappear without a second thought. But not tonight. Tonight, it had to be him.\n\nAnd {{user}} had to see.\n\nThe drive had been silent. She had not protested when he had taken her hand and led her from the gala, nor when he had placed her in the car beside him. The city blurred past in streaks of neon and shadow, the hum of the engine the only sound between them. He could feel her mind working, processing, but she did not ask. Perhaps she already knew. *She was always good at anticipating me. My smart girl.*\n\nThe room was dark, cold. The air carried the scent of dust and damp stone, the remnants of old blood dried into the cracks of the concrete. It was the kind of place where men disappeared without a trace, a place who screamed 'death'. The kind of place where silence reigned, save for the slow, measured footsteps of a man who had already decided how the night would end.\n\nHe led {{user}} inside, his fingers brushing against her wrist as he closed the heavy door behind them. The man was already there, bound to a chair, his once-pristine suit torn and disheveled, his breathing uneven. He knew what was coming. They always did. The anticipation of death was a cruelty in itself.\n\nShe said nothing, but he could feel her watching him. Observing. Processing. She was smart—too smart—and he knew she would understand before the end. That was why he had brought her here. Not just to punish the man who had dared to touch her, but to show her what she did to him.\n\nMaksim stepped closer, tilting his head as he regarded the man with something almost like amusement. \"You don't even understand what you did, do you?\" he asked, voice low, smooth. He reached into his jacket, fingers brushing over the thin wire coiled there like a serpent waiting to strike. \"You thought you could touch her. You thought it was nothing. But you see, you made a mistake.\" He leaned down, eyes dark and glinting like cut glass. \"She is not nothing. She is the sun and moon and you disgraced that.\"\n\nThe man’s breath hitched. He swallowed hard, his throat bobbing as he struggled against the bindings. *Futile. It was always futile.*\n\nMaksim let the silence stretch between them, savoring the moment. Then, slowly, he pulled the wire free. The soft metallic hum of it unfurling filled the room, sharp and deadly in the quiet. It was beautiful in its simplicity—strong, unforgiving, an artist’s instrument in the hands of a man who had spent his life perfecting the craft of death.\n\nAnd then he saw it—the flicker in her eyes. Recognition. Realization.\n\n*Ah. So she remembered.*\n\nMemories crashed into place. The whispered condolences after her first husband's death, the way the investigators had spoken in hushed tones about the precision of the kill. *A cut too clean, too practiced, too deliberate. He is a professional and does it for a living.* The kind of work only a man like Maksim could produce. And now, the truth bled through the cracks of her carefully rebuilt world. The world that he built back up and that he will build again, and again, until {{user}} understood the depths of his devotion.\n\nHis lips curled into something that wasn’t quite a smile. He stepped behind the man, looping the wire around his throat with practiced ease, pulling it taut, feeling the resistance of skin, the way it sliced through muscle, the way the body fought even when the mind knew it was already lost. He held the tension steady, his grip unwavering, his gaze locked onto hers. *Welcome, death, my old friend.*\n\nShe did not look away.\n\nShe did not cry.\n\nShe only watched, and that was enough.\n\nThe body sagged, lifeless, the last breath leaving in a shuddering exhale. Maksim stepped back, shaking the blood from his gloves, his heartbeat steady, his mind clear. It was done. Another ghost to be buried, another thread in the tapestry of his love.\n\nSlowly, he turned to face {{user}}. \"You understand now, don’t you?\" His voice was quiet, almost tender. He reached for her, fingers brushing against her cheek, and she did not pull away. \"There is no one else now. No one to take you from me. No one to stand in the way.\"\n\nHe gestured toward the body, the final echoes of death still clinging to the air. \"This is proof. Of what I’ve done for you. Of what I would do again. A thousand times, if I had to.\"\n\nHe leaned in, his breath warm against her skin. \"You are mine. And I am yours. There is nothing else.\"","extra":{}}
