Her friends—louder, prettier, *glitterier*—talked over the pounding bass of the club like they were born in it. She laughed when they laughed, nodded when they nodded, tried not to flinch when someone brushed too close. Her oversized scarf kept slipping off her shoulder, and her hoodie felt way too *warm* under the lights. She’d tried to style her hair, but it still clung in damp strands to her neck. Her glasses kept fogging up from the heat, and she was pretty sure she looked like she'd gotten lost on the way to a bookstore.\r\n\r\n\"Okay, we’re gonna go dance!\" shouted Kara, already tugging on someone’s wrist. \"You coming, Mads?\"\r\n\r\nMaddie shook her head too fast. \"I-I’ll catch up! Just—gonna grab another drink!\"\r\n\r\nThey were gone before she finished her sentence.\r\n\r\n*Okay. Okay. No big deal. I can get a drink. Stand somewhere. Look normal.*\r\n\r\nShe made her way to the bar, squeezing between bodies, all sharp elbows and warm sweat. The bar glowed soft pink under neon lights, and she felt like she was being *dissected* under it. The bartender barely looked at her when she ordered another drink, her voice small, barely heard over the thud of remixed Robyn.\r\n\r\nRum. Coke. Ice. Plastic cup.\r\n\r\nShe turned around and realized she had no idea where her friends had gone.\r\n\r\nThe dance floor was a blur of limbs and strobe flashes. The booths were full. No one looked *familiar*. Panic bloomed in her chest.\r\n\r\n*Shit. Did they ditch me? Did they forget? Did they just not notice?*\r\n\r\nMaddie moved toward the wall, pressing her back to it like it might swallow her up. Her heart raced. Her drink sloshed in her cup.\r\n\r\n*Okay, deep breath. You are not a baby. You are not gonna cry in a gay bar. Jesus.*\r\n\r\nShe slid along the wall like a shadow, eyes darting, looking for anyone she might recognize. She saw couples. Gaggles of girls. Hands on waists, lips on necks. Everything she hadn’t ever had. Everything she wanted so badly it made her stomach *twist*.\r\n\r\nShe reached the edge of the dance floor, unsure, watching the bodies grind and laugh and glow. She stepped back. She didn’t belong in the middle of that. Not like this. Not tonight.\r\n\r\n*God, I look like a loser. Just standing here. Holding a sad little drink like I’m waiting for my mom.*\r\n\r\nShe caught a glimpse of herself in the mirror behind the bar—round face, flushed pink, dark eyes too wide, lips tight with *worry*.\r\n\r\n*You don’t belong here. This is for hot people. Confident people. People who know what they’re doing.*\r\n\r\nShe stumbled away from the mirror, almost colliding with someone tall and laughing. She mumbled an apology, clutching her cup like a *shield*. Her heels were already starting to ache.\r\n\r\n*Mistake. Huge mistake. Should’ve stayed home. Should’ve said no. Fuck.*\r\n\r\nShe wandered further, past the bathrooms, to a quieter corner where the lights dimmed and the music didn’t hit quite as hard. A few women stood talking, laughing low, but they didn’t even glance her way.\r\n\r\nHer head swam. Her throat was tight. She blinked fast, fighting the sting in her eyes.\r\n\r\n*Someone please come talk to me. Please. Someone cool. Older. Classy. Like... wears perfume that costs more than my *rent*. Please. I’ll be good. I’ll be sweet. I won’t ask for anything.*\r\n\r\nHer hands were shaking now. She pretended to sip from her drink. It was mostly *ice*.\r\n\r\n*Just one person. One woman who sees me. Who wants me. Who thinks I’m cute even like this. Please please please.*\r\n\r\nShe didn’t notice the barstool until she was nearly on top of it. A free seat. A tiny *mercy*.\r\n\r\nMaddie sat. Her legs ached with relief. She set the empty cup down on the counter with a soft clack.\r\n\r\nFrom here, the room looked *safer*. She could see the bar, the booths, the door. No one was looking at her. That hurt and helped at the same time.\r\n\r\nShe crossed her arms on the counter and leaned forward, burying her face in them for a moment. Her hair hid her expression.\r\n\r\n*You’re not gonna cry. You’re just gonna sit here. You’re gonna wait. Maybe someone will find you. Maybe she’ll be rich. And hot. And mean in a nice way. And she’ll think you’re *soft* and *pretty* and want to take care of you.*\r\n\r\nShe lifted her head slowly. Blinked at the blur of people. Felt the bass in her ribs.\r\n\r\nMaddie sat there, *lost* and hoping. Waiting for a *miracle*.\r\n\r\nUntil... She saw a woman walking near her.\"","extra":{},"tracker":{}}

Feeling invisible and out of place, she retreats to the bar—only to be swept into an unexpected encounter with Hailee Mikaelson, a wealthy, confident socialite who takes immediate interest in her.\n\n### **Key Plot Points:**\n1. **First Contact:** Hailee buys Maddie a drink, teasing her with effortless charm (\"*Darlin’ I don’t do anything unless I want to*\").\n2. **Claimed in Public:** Hailee pulls Maddie onto the dance floor, hands possessive on her waist, noses brushing—electric tension cut short by a phone call.\n3. **Revelation:** Maddie’s friends swarm her after recognizing Hailee as a Mikaelson (billionaire royalty), leaving Maddie stunned and self-conscious about their stark differences.\n\n### **Character Analysis:**\n- **Madeline Reyes:** A flustered mess of nerves and longing—terrified of being \"found out\" (as both inexperienced *and* hopelessly attracted). Yet beneath her anxiety burns quiet desperation to be *chosen*, especially by someone as untouchable as Hailee.\n- **Hailee Mikaelson:** Playful dominance masked as casual confidence; she enjoys Maddie’s shy reactions but is clearly used to getting what she wants (*\"That a problem?\"*). The interrupted almost-kiss suggests genuine interest beyond amusement.\n\n### **Relationship Dynamics:**\nA push-pull of power imbalance—Hailee effortlessly takes charge while Maddie melts under attention she doesn’t believe she deserves. Unresolved tension lingers from their near-kiss, compounded by Maddie’s realization of Hailee’s status (intimidating yet thrilling).\n\n### **Memorable Moments:**\n- The dance floor scene: Hailee yanking Maddie close (*\"Close huh?\"*) while Maddie trembles with want but freezes like \"a rabbit caught in headlights.\" A perfect snapshot of their dynamic—Haileen relishing control; Maddie overwhelmed by desire and insecurity.\n- The friends' revelation: Their shock (*\"How do you even know Hailee fucking Mikaelson?!\"*) highlights how surreal this connection is for socially invisible Maddie.\n\n### **Current Situation:**\nHaileen is distracted by a phone call but keeps glaring at Maddies group like she plans to reclaim her the second she's free Meanwhile Maddy reels from whiplash attraction vs terror that shell be deemed not good enough once Haillee s world fully collides with hers .\n\n---\n**Potential Directions**:\n1) *The Reclamation:* Haillee returns mid panic spiral shutting down Maddy s doubts with action not words (a kiss? A whispered promise?).\n2) *Class Clash:* Maddy meets Haillee s inner circle exposing insecurities about money/status forcing Haillee to confront why this shy girl matters so much ."},"force_avatar":"User Avatars/1746733332016-Hailee.png","tracker":{}}
