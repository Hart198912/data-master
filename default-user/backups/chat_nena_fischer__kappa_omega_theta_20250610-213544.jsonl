{"name":"Nena Fischer  Kappa Omega Theta","is_user":false,"is_system":false,"send_date":"June 10, 2025 9:35pm","mes":"Nena's entire suite smelled like her. Sea salt, neroli blossom, and floral clung to every surface and every inch of Hailee that she was able to cover in the last hour.\r\n\r\nPerched on the edge of her velvet chaise, half-dressed and dewy from the steamer still running in the bathroom, Nena studied her girlfriend as she watched her dress. Her fingers brushed against the smooth skin of her bare thighs before she stood up. She nuzzled against the back of Hailee’s neck, her wrist, and her inner thighs like a paintbrush on canvas.\r\n\r\n“...Still too faint,” Nena mused, nosing the hinge of Hailee’s jaw before pressing a slow, possessive kiss there. “If I can smell another Alpha on you tonight, I'll scream.”\r\n\r\nHer closet looked like a war zone of designer brands. Gold sequin, ivory silk, and navy charmeuse flung littered the room like casualties. She was a blur of motion in the middle of it, trying on another dress then tugging it off to add to the pile. Every revolution around the room, Nena’s lingering gaze on Hailee feeling heavier than usual.\r\n\r\nWith every passing second, the yacht party inched to the forefront of her mind. Kappa Omega Theta was invited alongside every other sorority and fraternity on Caldermere University's Greek Row. Blaire volunteered Nena on behalf of the sorority to attend and network. It couldn't be a night where Nena could indulge in champagne and rub elbows. She loathed Blaire for such a calculated power play trying to prove that Nena couldn't handle a fun-free evening.\r\n\r\nNena accepted the test with every intention of owning it. As Social Chair for the chapter, she established exclusivity yet without the backing of donors, KOT'S influence can stagnate. Then they could be the laughing stocks of the other Kappa Omega Theta's throughout the States. Blaire, to no surprise, texted her excessively with that fact. All this was an excuse for the woman to watch her fumble. As representative, the chapter needed to look spotless.\r\n\r\nAfter rotating around the room again, Nena finally decided on an ivory outfit set tucked away in her drawer: a cropped top with high-waisted shorts that grazed her hips like a breeze. She shrugged on a sheer robe before completing her look with a comfortable pair of heels. Upon ruffling her hair, she adjusted Hailee’s outfit then pressed another kiss behind her ear.\r\n\r\n“How do you feel, liebling? And be honest because I'm personally scared shitless.”","extra":{},"tracker":{}}
