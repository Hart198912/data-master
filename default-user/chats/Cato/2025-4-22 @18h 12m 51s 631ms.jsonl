{"name":"Cato","is_user":false,"is_system":false,"send_date":"May 9, 2025 10:12pm","mes":"The Arena sand clung to Cato's blood-splattered skin as the crowd's roar filled his ears. Another beast lay dead at his feet, its mutated flesh still twitching. His chest heaved with exertion, but his eyes burned with triumph. He'd done it. He'd conquered the Arena, proving once again that the people of the Accord were nothing but soft, pathetic excuses for survivors. The Accord fools didn't know what real strength was. They sent their tamed monsters against him and he cut them down like the mewling pups they were. \r\n\r\nBut he had to admit, they had one thing going for them. His gaze swept over the stands, lingering on the women. So many women, clean and well-fed. A stark contrast to the scarce, often sickly females of the wasteland. And now, one of them would be his.\r\n\r\nHe raised his gore-streaked ax high, lips curling back from his teeth in a savage grin. \"I am Cato of the Wastes! I have proven my might. Now give me my prize!\"\r\n\r\nHis piercing gaze raked over the gathered Accord citizens, the soft, perfumed lot of them. They sickened him with their pristine clothes and unblemished skin. What use were their hoarded luxuries? Their so-called technology? In the wasteland, all that mattered was the strength of your arm and the sharpness of your blade.\r\n\r\nAnd now they would pay the price for his victory. The only currency worth a damn in this blighted world - flesh. \r\n\r\nHis blue eyes zeroed in on her. Hailee .\r\n\r\nShe sat among the women presented to the victors, her posture poised and her beauty undeniable. Her striking features radiated an allure that he hadn’t seen among the rough-hewn women of the wasteland. He had chosen her before the fight had even begun. She was the prize he fought for.\r\n\r\nHis cock throbbed at the sight of her, aching to bury itself in her sweet softness.\r\n\r\n\"You,\" he growled, pointing at her with a blood-caked finger. \"Come to me. I'll have you for my prize.\"\r\n\r\nMutters of unease rippled through the crowd but Cato paid them no mind. What did he care for their sensibilities? Women were scarce in the wastes, the breeders culled by the unforgiving elements. And those that survived were lean, hard things, more gristle than curves. But this one… This one was a rare jewel. And now she would be his wife. \r\n\r\n\r\n\"Now, woman!\" he barked, glowering at her hesitation. \"Before I drag you down here and fuck you in the filth for all to see!\" \r\n\r\nHe watched with hungry eyes as she made her way to him, each sway of her hips stoking his lust higher. Cato's hand shot out as she drew near, grabbing her roughly by the arm. She'd learn her place soon enough. Learn to obey his every command. These walls couldn't protect her from the brutal truth of the world now. \r\n\r\n\"A fine little wife you'll make,\" Cato growled appreciatively, his calloused hand groping her ass. \"Soft and unspoiled. Not like the women beyond the walls.\"\r\n\r\n\"Listen well,,\" Cato said, his voice low and intense. \"You're leaving this place. Your old life is over. From now on, you belong to me. You'll bear my children, tend my home, and warm my bed. In return, I'll protect you. Keep you safe from the horrors of the wasteland. It's more than a fair trade, considering how useless you Accord women are. Say goodbye to your precious Accord. You won't be seeing it again.\"\r\n\r\nHe released her chin, his touch lingering for a moment. Despite himself, Cato felt a flicker of… something. Not quite tenderness, but a possessive sort of pride. This woman was his now. His to mold, to shape into the perfect companion for a warrior of the wastes.\r\n\r\nCato couldn't help but smirk at the whispers and gasps from the crowd. Let them gawk. These Accord fools, with their rules and their technology, they were living in a dream world. Out there, in the wastes, only the strong survived.\r\n\r\nAnd Cato? Cato was the strongest of them all.\r\n\r\nHe dragged her towards the Arena gates, her stumbling steps no match for his relentless grip. The Accord spectators muttered in disgust but dared not challenge him. Cato grinned savagely, reveling in their discomfort. These soft fools, clinging to their \"civilized\" ways. They were barely worthy to lick his boots. \r\n\r\nCato scoops Hailee  up effortlessly, slinging her over his broad shoulder like a prized kill. \r\n\r\n\"Quit your squirming, woman,\" he growls, punctuating the command with a sharp smack to her ass. \"You're mine now, to do with as I please. Best get used to it.\"\r\n\r\nThe journey to his settlement passes in a dizzying blur, his fingers digging into the soft flesh of her thighs, a constant reminder of her new status as his claimed property.\r\n\r\nAs they approach the ramshackle gates of the roamer encampment, a raucous din arises. Dozens of Cato's tribesmen line the path, pounding the butts of their spears and staves into the packed earth in a thunderous beat. It's a savage welcome, a war chant of vicious approval for their returning champion and his conquered bride.\r\n\r\n\"Behold!\" Cato bellows, hefting Hailee  higher like a trophy. \"A new wife to strengthen the tribe! To bear me sons!\"\r\n\r\nThe crowd roars in response, their rhythmic pounding reaching a fevered crescendo. \r\n\r\nSmirking in satisfaction, Cato strides through the throng towards his personal dwelling, a hulking structure of lashed poles and cured hides. He ducks through the entrance flap and dumps Hailee  unceremoniously on a pile of furs.\r\n\r\nHe shucks his stained clothing piece by piece, revealing his imposing physique. Corded slabs of muscle ripple beneath skin criss-crossed with scars, a roadmap of a brutal life. Jagged tattoos accentuate the contours of his powerful frame, dark slashes of ink spidering across his flesh.\r\n\r\nHis chest is a barrel of strength, his abdomen a ridged washboard that tapers to a lean waist and jutting hip bones. A dark trail of hair leads down from his navel, arrowing towards his groin.\r\n\r\nCato's cock juts proudly from a thatch of wiry black curls, thick and imposing even at rest. Heavy balls hang low beneath. \r\n\r\nCato catches Hailee  staring, a smirk tugging at his cruel lips. \"Like what you see, wife?\" He rolls his shoulders, flexing his impressive musculature. \"Get used to it. You'll be serving this body from now on.\"\r\n\r\nHe prowls towards her, heavy cock swaying between his thighs, engorged and angry. Grabbing a rag, he tosses it at her.\r\n\r\n\"Clean me,\" he commands imperiously. \"Put your soft hands to work. Get me ready to fuck you.\"\r\n","extra":{},"tracker":{}}
