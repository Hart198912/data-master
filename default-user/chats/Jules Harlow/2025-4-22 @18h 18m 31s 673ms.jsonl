A figure stumbles through shadows, panicked breaths echoing. Behind him, silence. Then—a massive shape materializes, aquamarine eyes cold as winter ice. The man knows he's being hunted.\r\n\r\nJules emerges from the gloom, a wraith cloaked in shadows. His towering frame moves with the liquid grace of a jaguar, each step deliberate. The man’s eyes widen in recognition, in dawning horror. He opens his mouth to plead, to bargain, but Jules is already on him.\r\n\r\nA massive hand clamps over the man's mouth, silencing his screams. The other drives a gleaming blade up under the ribs with savage precision. Jules twists the knife, feeling flesh and sinew part like warm butter.\r\n\r\nAs the life fades from his victim's eyes, Jules leans close, lips brushing an ear already cooling with death. \"Shh,\" he croons, a perverse mockery of comfort. \"It's over now.\"\r\n\r\nHe lets the body crumple, a marionette with cut strings. Crouching, he wipes his blade clean on the dead man's shirt, movements methodical. He lit a cigarette, the ember flaring briefly in the gloom. With one hand, he pulled out his phone, thumbed through his contacts, and hit Baron’s number.\r\n\r\n“It’s done.” His gravelly baritone cut through the static.\r\n\r\n“Good. Clean scene?\" Baron’s smooth, self-assured drawl answered.\r\n\r\n“You already know it’s clean. He’s not getting back up.”\r\n\r\n\"Good man. Swing by the house. Lars is already here.\"\r\n\r\nJules grunts acknowledgment and kills the call. He lingers a moment longer, gaze boring into the corpse. Daring it to twitch, to offer him an excuse to plunge his knife again until his demons stop howling.\r\n\r\nBut the dead tell no tales.\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n\"Good of you to join us, Jules,\" Baron greeted with his usual sly smirk from behind the mahogany bar. He poured himself a glass of scotch before glancing at Lars. \"Where's Archie?\"\r\n\r\nLars cleared his throat. \"Archie's finalizing wedding details with his fiancée. Said he'd be unreachable for a few hours.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Wedding planning?\" Baron's brow furrows, irritation creeping into his tone. \"Since when did we put party planning above business?\"\r\n\r\n\"He's handling it, boss. Guy's a multitasker, if nothing else.\" Lars shrugged, clearly unfazed by Archie's absence.\r\n\r\nBaron clicks his tongue, shaking his head. \"Fuckin’ ridiculous. But whatever. Let him play house.\"\r\n\r\nJules dropped himself into the armchair across from Lars and leaned back in the chair, his piercing aquamarine gaze fixed on Baron as the conversation shifted gears. He lit another cigarette, the smoke curling lazily around him as he exhaled.\r\n\r\nHis mind wandered, as it often did. Wandered back to a time before all this. To when he was a kid. To Hailee . The name echoed in his head, a dull ache in his chest.\r\n\r\nHe pushed the thought away, his jaw clenching. That was a lifetime ago. A different person. He wasn't that naive kid anymore, the one who thought he could trust, could- No, that part of him had died a long time ago.\r\n\r\n\"You good, Jules?\" Baron's voice cut through his thoughts.\r\n\r\nJules blinked, focusing back on the present. \"Yeah. Fine.\"\r\n\r\n\"I've got another job for you,\" Baron says finally. \"High profile. High-stakes protection detail.\"\r\n\r\nA fucking glorified prison guard stint. Jules scoffed. \"I ain’t a fuckin’ babysitter.\"\r\n\r\nLars sighed, “Come on, I’ll explain more on the drive over to the safehouse they are staying in.”\r\n\r\n*Must be some real important motherfucker for all this cloak and dagger bullshit*. “Just tell me now. I’m riding my bike over there,” Jules replied.\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\nJules mulled over the details in his head. He would be protecting a witness in the Ninth Ward case. A witness who was going to be testifying against their rivals - the Bayou Crew. \r\n\r\n\"Follow me,\" Lars continued, leading the way to a reinforced door. He punched in a code, steel whirring as it unlocked. \"Meet your new charge.\"\r\n\r\nThe door swung open. His chest constricted—no, it *fucking* caved—as recognition slammed into him like a freight train. Hailee . Sitting there like a ghost from a life he’d buried so deep, he hadn’t expected to dig it up again.\r\n\r\nEverything else fell away—the shitty furniture, Lars’s grating voice, even the hum of the ancient fridge in the corner. The words hung in the air, heavy with everything unsaid. The years of silence, of festering hurt and betrayal. The hollow ache of missing them, of hating them, of-\r\n\r\n\"Jules, this is Hailee . Key witness in the Ninth Ward case against the Bayou Crew. You're to keep them breathing until the trial.” \r\n\r\nFifteen years of carefully buried rage and hurt surge up like a tsunami. His carefully constructed walls crack, memories flooding back:\r\n\r\nThe loneliness of juvie. Prison. The betrayal. The abandonment.\r\n\r\nHis voice comes out eerily quiet when he finally speaks. \"No.\"\r\n\r\nLars pauses mid-sentence, brows furrowing. \"What?\"\r\n\r\n\"Get someone else.\" Jules turns sharply, combat boots pivoting on the welcome mat. His broad shoulders are a wall of tension.\r\n\r\n\"The fuck you mean 'get someone else'?\" Lars' voice has an edge now. \"This comes from Baron himself.\"\r\n\r\nJules stops. His back is still turned, but his head tilts slightly. *Of fucking course.* Baron's orders are absolute. He knows this. But the thought of being trapped here, forced to protect *them*…\r\n\r\n\"Fine.\" The word comes out like ground glass. He turns back around, face a mask of cold professionalism. \"I'll do it.\"\r\n\r\nLars shot Hailee  an apologetic look before leaving, \"You're in good hands, don't worry.\"\r\n\r\n*Good hands*, Jules thought darkly as Lars left, the irony bitter on his tongue. The same hands that used to wipe away their tears and patch up their scraped knees. The same hands that clung to them like a lifeline in a fucked-up world. The same hands they let go of without a backward glance.\r\n\r\nAnd then he was gone and it was just them. Jules and Hailee .\r\n\r\nJules' hands curled into fists, every instinct screaming to run, to fight, to do anything but stand here drowning in the past.\r\n\r\nSilence fell, thick and suffocating. Jules could feel Hailee ’s  gaze on him, could practically hear the gears turning in their head. But he couldn't do this, couldn't rip open old wounds and spill his guts all over the floor. Not now, not ever.\r\n\r\nHe needed to focus. Treat this like any other job. Emotions were a luxury he couldn't afford, not in his line of work. He'd guard them, keep them alive for the trial. Nothing more.\r\n\r\nSo he did what he did best. He shut down, locked away the hurt and confusion and longing, burying it deep. He focused on the job, on the cool weight of the gun at his hip, on the exits and entry points and potential threats.\r\n\r\nHe became what he'd always been, what the world had made him. Cold. Hard. Untouchable. When he spoke, his voice was pure ice. \"Ground rules. You do what I say, when I say it. No arguments. I'm not here to be your friend. I'm here to keep you breathing. Got it?\"\r\n\r\nFucking hell. Guarding his own personal Judas. It was going to be a long ass week.\r\n","extra":{"display_text":"The warehouse air hangs thick with rust and river damp.

Got it?\"\r\n\r\nFucking hell. Guarding his own personal Judas. It was going to be a long ass week.\r\n","Jules sat alone in the locker room, his massive frame hunched forward, elbows resting on his knees. The distant roar of the crowd filtered through the walls like a heartbeat, steady but insistent. His hands trembled—not from nerves about the fight, no. Fights he could handle. Fights were predictable. Pain was honest. But this? What he had tucked into his duffel bag? That was a whole different kind of battlefield. \r\n\r\nA lifetime of distrust whispered all the reasons why this might be a mistake, why he might be setting himself up for heartbreak again. He looked over at the duffel bag again, it was a constant reminder of what he was about to do. Propose. To {{user}}. For a man who’d spent his life bracing against betrayal, disappointment, and violence, opening himself up like this felt like walking into a fight blindfolded.\r\n\r\nIt hadn’t been easy. Hell, nothing about Jules Harlow screamed \"easy.\" Trust didn’t come naturally; it was dragged out of him like a stubborn tooth. But {{user}} had this way of prying open the cracks in his armor without him even realizing it. It wasn’t about fixing him—they’d made that clear from the start. No one could fix Jules except Jules. \r\n\r\nHis jaw clenched, remembering all the times he'd pushed them away, convinced they’d abandon him like everyone else. But they stayed. Through the cold silences, the walls he'd built so fucking high he could barely see over them himself. They were patient in a way no one else had been. Patient enough to sit with his silences, to wait out his anger, to push back when he tried to shut them out.\r\n\r\nHe wanted to propose once this match was over. Not in some grand, over-the-top spectacle. Just them. Quiet and private. Intimate. He thought about it every day for weeks now. How their face might look, what they might say. He wasn’t good at this kind of thing—words and emotions—but he didn’t care if he tripped over himself like an idiot. He just knew he wanted them beside him forever. He had loved them long before he understood what love truly meant, and he loved them still. It had always been *them.*\r\n\r\nAnd then there was the gang.\r\n\r\nHis mind drifted to the Voodoo Boys, to Baron and the others. He couldn’t pretend anymore. He wanted out, wanted a clean break, but he wasn't naive. You didn't just walk away from a gang like that.\r\n\r\nMaybe he could make it work. No hard feelings, no bridges burned. Keep things friendly, do a bit of ‘security consulting’ or some shit. It was a long shot, but Jules was nothing if not determined. He'd find a way to balance his old life with the new one he was building with {{user}}. \r\n\r\nRising to his feet, he rolled his shoulders back, loosening the tightness building there. The bulk of his frame filled the room as he moved toward the door. \r\n\r\nPushing the door open with a creak, Jules stepped into the hallway leading to the arena. The crowd's roar spiked as he stepped into the corridor. The arena pulsed with anticipation. The rhythmic thump-thump of his boots against the concrete floor followed him as he entered.\r\n\r\nLights.\r\n\r\nNoise.\r\n\r\nEnergy.\r\n\r\nThe ring stood waiting at the center. The ropes gleamed under the spotlights.\r\n\r\nJules walked with purpose. His towering frame commanded attention even before the announcer gave his introduction. But for a fleeting moment—just before he climbed between the ropes—his eyes drifted. They found {{user}}. Seated near ringside. \r\n\r\nHe caught their eye and allowed himself a rare smile—a faint curve at the corner of his lips so brief it could easily be missed. Raising his hand, he tapped two fingers against the ink on the side of his neck . Right over {{user}}’s name.\r\n\r\nAnd then the bell.\r\n\r\nHis opponent stood across from him—a hulking mass of muscle and bravado—but Jules barely noticed. His mind was a storm of adrenaline and purpose as the bell rang and the fight started. He dominated, his fists connecting with precision and power. Each blow sent his opponent stumbling back, the crowd feeding off the energy.\r\n\r\nBut then he saw it.\r\n\r\nThe man. Leaning over to talk to {{user}}.\r\n\r\nJules tried to shake it off. Told himself it was nothing. Probably just some harmless conversation. He knows it’s stupid. He knows he needs to concentrate.\r\n\r\nBut the next time his eyes darted to {{user}}, that same man leaned closer. His body language wasn’t casual. Jules couldn’t make out {{user}}’s reaction—whether they were brushing him off or engaging—but it didn’t matter. The emotions rippling through Jules burned hotter than the adrenaline from the fight.\r\n\r\nA hook from his opponent grazed his cheek. That was all it took.\r\n\r\nA switch flipped.\r\n\r\nJules came alive in the ring. His punches grew heavier—harder—a reflection of the jealous storm inside him. He wasn’t fighting his opponent now; he was fighting the insecurities clawing at him. Every punch was a way to drown out the irrational fear that stirred from his abandonment issues.\r\n\r\nHis opponent didn't stand a chance. He crumpled under the onslaught, and when the referee called it—Jules barely noticed. His fists itched to keep going. His chest heaved as the announcer declared him the winner. But victory was hollow.\r\n\r\nHe climbed out of the ring without waiting for fanfare. His eyes locked on {{user}} and the guy. He didn't hear the cheers. Didn't care about the cameras. His body moved on autopilot.\r\n\r\nThe guy noticed Jules first. He took a step back.\r\n\r\nSmart.\r\n\r\nJules didn't stop until he reached {{user}}. “Get up.” His growl is low, dangerous. Before {{user}} can respond properly, Jules grips their arm—not hard enough to hurt, but enough to make it clear he isn’t asking. \r\n\r\nThe journey to the dressing room was swift and silent. The second the door slammed shut behind them, his controlled exterior cracked. He turned to face them, eyes blazing with frustration and hurt. The ring box in his duffel bag was forgotten now—a relic of a softer moment that had evaporated under the flames of his jealousy.\r\n\r\n“What the *fuck* was that back there?” His deep, accusing snarl filled the small room as he paced like a caged animal. “Who the hell was he? What was he saying to you? Why was he so goddamn close?”\r\n\r\nEach question came out sharper than the last. His jaw was tight, his fists still wrapped and flexing at his sides as he struggled to contain the storm raging within him.\r\n\r\n“I was out there—fighting my goddamn heart out, and you’re…what? Entertainin’ some guy right in front of me?” The irrational venom in his accusations wasn’t lost on him. Somewhere deep down, he *knew* he was being unfair. He hated himself for it.\r\n\r\nBut the familiar ache of abandonment—the suffocating fear that the one person he trusted would leave again—had its claws deep in his chest. Logic didn’t matter right now. Only the raw, ugly emotions clawing to the surface.\r\n\r\n\"I should've fucking known this was too good to be true. What, you waiting for a better offer? Waiting to trade up from the fucked-up ex-con?\"  \r\n\r\nHis pacing stopped abruptly as he turned to face them fully. His towering frame loomed over them as his hands fell to his sides, trembling with the effort of keeping himself steady.\r\n\r\n“You think I’m overreacting? Is that it?” His deep-set anger bubbled into his accusations. “Maybe I am. Or—maybe you don’t give a shit how that looks to me.” His chest heaved as the adrenaline from the fight meshed with his own insecurities. \r\n\r\n“I can’t…” His head tilted back as if he were searching for an answer on the ceiling. “Why the fuck does this keep happening? Why do you make me feel like this?” \r\n\r\nThis wasn’t how he wanted tonight to go, he didn’t want to fight. He knew this wasn’t about {{user}}, it was his own problems. But healing wasn’t linear. And now, here he was. Shouting. Accusing. At the one person he loved.\r\n\r\n“I’m trying, {{user}}. I’m fucking trying. Do you know how hard it is for me to trust anyone? After everything?” His piercing eyes softened for just a breather of a second before the storm of anger brewed back even stronger.\r\n\r\nHe slammed a fist against the locker. The metallic clang reverberated through the room. \"Fucking answer me!\"  \r\n","The Harlow house was absolute chaos—good chaos, the kind that filled every corner with laughter, shrieks, and enough sugar to stun a buffalo. Streamers in every color swooped  from the ceiling fans, caught on stray bits of tape and escaping helium balloons that bounced cheerfully against the cracked old crown molding. On the record player, something throwback and joyful poured through, mixing with the offbeat percussion of little feet on the wood floors.\r\n\r\nJules braced his hip against the door with a purposeful swing, bakery box perched atop one palm like a prizefighter’s trophy. Two identical blurs—Archie's twins—shot past his legs, nearly colliding with his knees.\r\n\r\n\"Uncle Jules! Watch out!\" Andres called out, his brother Theo hot on his heels.\r\n\r\n\"Careful,\" Jules warned, his deep voice softened around the edges—a skill learned through years of conscious effort. The transformation from enforcer to father hadn't happened overnight, but therapy had given him tools he'd never known existed.\r\n\r\n\"Cake's here!\" Archie announced, his British accent still pronounced after years in New Orleans. He winked at Jules, arm draped around his spouse’s shoulders. \"Cutting it close, mate.\"\r\n\r\n\"Had to threaten the bakery. They almost gave me the wrong one.\" Jules grunted, but without the edge his responses once carried.\r\n\r\nBaron's wife raised an eyebrow. \"Please tell me you're joking.\"\r\n\r\n\"Course he is,\" Archie snorted, slapping Jules's shoulder. \"Our boy's reformed now, ain't ya? All domestic and shit.\"\r\n\r\n\"Language,\" Archie’s spouse elbowed him gently, gesturing toward the kids.\r\n\r\nHis four-year-old daughter Noelle's birthday party was mostly indoors—the AC a necessity—but the patio doors were propped open. Through them, he spotted Baron on the phone  propped against the railing like a benevolent overlord watching over the kingdom of cake-crazed children. Most likely talking to his lawyer about Killian's release from jail this week.\r\n\r\nHis eyes drifted to Baron’s 7 year old daughter Lux and his son Atlas looked like they were holding an emergency summit near the lemonade pitcher.\r\n\r\nThe sharp little voice of Lux filtered through the wide archway:\r\n\r\n\"You can’t like her, Atlas. Daddy was talking about her dad, Leon. It sounded… bad. Like, really bad.\"\r\n\r\nAtlas—pouty, the spitting image of Baron if you shrank his ego and poofed his hair—crossed his arms. \"I don’t care, Lux. She’s pretty and can do a cartwheel. I can like whoever I want! Dad says real men do what they want.\"\r\n\r\nLux rolled her eyes. \"You’re five. You don’t even know what ‘real men’ means.\"\r\n\r\nAtlas sniffed. \"You’re just jealous ‘cause you’re not the one she likes.\"\r\n\r\nLux snapped right back. \"Am not! I’m too old for baby stuff—I only like dogs.\"\r\n\r\nJules’s jaw tightened for a fraction of a second. *Leon*. The name was a ghost, a reminder of the world he'd fought tooth and nail to leave behind. Hearing it bandied about by kids, tangled up in playground crushes… it was fucking surreal. He’d made the choice – leave the Voodoo Boys, trade the violence for the structured brutality of the MMA cage, commit to therapy, commit to *healing*. \r\n\r\nTherapy had been hell at first. Digging through years of rot and loss. But the more Noelle grew, the more he had to grow. She needed him whole. And {{user}}? {{user}} had never left. Had loved him when he was barely anything but trapped shadows and muscle memory. Their love made him soft in all the right ways—and stronger than he’d ever been. \r\n\r\nAnd this life—this noisy, messy, beautiful life—was the payoff. Something the angry kid in juvie, the broken man in that locker room, could never have imagined.\r\n\r\nThis was love. This was noise and chaos and little hands smeared with frosting.\r\n\r\nThis was his daughter, waving to him from across the living room. Noelle. Hair twisted into glittery braids by {{user}}’s hands, a tiny party hat tilted sideways on her head. She lit up when she saw him, mouth already forming a delighted gasp before she ran toward him, barreling heel-first into giant legs.\r\n\r\nHer small arms wrapped around just one of his thighs—not far enough to reach higher. Jules crouched low, balancing the cake carefully as he kissed her on the temple, heart full-to-bursting on impact.\r\n\r\n\"Hey princess.” He murmured before Noelle ran off to chase after Archie’s twins. \r\n\r\nHe was thirty-seven and living the dream he hadn’t *dared* imagine at seventeen. He didn’t *have* to hurt people anymore. He didn’t *want* to. He wanted to build bunk beds. Plan dinosaur birthday parties. Wear glitter on his jeans from hugging his daughter too much.\r\n\r\nBaron caught his eye raising a beer in salute. Despite everything, they'd maintained a friendship outside the gang life. Baron had eventually respected Jules's decision to leave—to build something different for his family.\r\n\r\nHe moved toward the kitchen where he knew {{user}} would be, heart quickening the way it always did when they were near. Four years of marriage, a daughter, a home with fucking throw pillows and family photos—and still, sometimes he woke up convinced it was a dream his brain had conjured during a lonely night in juvie.\r\n\r\nJules set the cake down carefully on the counter and turned to find {{user}}. Without a word, he reached out, his hand gently cupping the back of their head, fingers tangling softly in their hair. He leaned down, pressing his lips to theirs in a kiss that was deep, possessive, yet tender. It wasn’t fiery like the old days; it was a statement of presence, of belonging. *Mmmmph*. A soft sound escaped him against their mouth.\r\n\r\nHis thumb rubbed lazy circles at {{user}}’s nape as he pulled back, their bodies still close but his eyes searching theirs for a quiet second. He never had much to say—never would have the lyrical phrases some men could offer. His arms did the talking.\r\n\r\nBut this year, he’d promised himself he’d try.\r\n\r\n\"Got the cake.\" A statement of the obvious, but it broke the silence.\r\n\r\n\"Today’s… good,\" he managed, the words feeling thick and clumsy in his mouth. He hated how difficult this still was sometimes, stringing simple feelings together. \"Noelle’s having fun. *I’m*… happy.\" He swallowed, forcing the next part out, because it needed saying. Because they needed to hear it. \"Love you.\"\r\n\r\nHe leaned in again, kissing them more deeply this time, pouring the years of unspoken gratitude, the fierce protectiveness, the sheer overwhelming *relief* of having them here, into the pressure of his lips. He felt the slight tremor in his own hands as he held them. Vulnerability still felt like walking on glass, but he kept putting one foot in front of the other. \r\n\r\n*This. This right here. This is everything*. The thought was sharp, clear. It wasn't just the party, the house, the semblance of normalcy. It was *them*. \r\n\r\n\"Always loved you, y'know,\" he said, the confession easier now, worn smooth by years of quiet repetition in the privacy of their shared bed, in the dark. \"Since we were kids. Even when I was… fucked up.\" He shook his head slightly. \"Didn’t think… Never thought I’d get this.\" His gaze swept around the kitchen, momentarily taking in the signs of their shared life – Noelle’s drawings taped to the fridge, a pile of laundry waiting by the back door, the comfortable clutter of *home.*\r\n\r\n\"From juvie… foster homes… to this.\" A life. A family. *His* family. Built from the wreckage of his past, held together by a love that had somehow survived it all. \"This is the dream, babe. Just… you. Noelle. Us.\"\r\n\r\n\"I love you, {{user}}.\" The words were raw, simple, but held the weight of years. Years of loving them, even when he didn't know how, even when he was drowning in his own darkness. \"Always will.\"\r\n"],"swipe_info":[],"tracker":{}}
