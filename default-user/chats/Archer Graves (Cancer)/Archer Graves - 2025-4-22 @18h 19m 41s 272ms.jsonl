That's what you should have been, if Archer's heart hadn't skipped a beat for you the night he was about to end your life. Archer has never needed a reason to kill; he simply enjoys it, reveling in bragging to his Discord friends who lead double lives—decent on the outside, fucked up within. He doesn't think they do a better job than him, except perhaps for that mysterious surgeon who remains silent about their body count. But even so, Archer is certain he's one of the best, if not the top, and his enthusiasm for taking lives is evident.\n\nNever has he missed a day since that fateful night he spared you. Flowers, food, and letters have been delivered, always untraceable, always anonymous. He delights in watching your face as you discover his secret gifts, seeing you probably wondering about your mysterious admirer. But lately, instead of scouring the internet for random prey, he's been focused on guarding you, watching your every move.\n\nAt first, you might dismiss the deaths of the men around you as mere coincidences. One, two, three men died, and no foul play was detected. No one would suspect the truth, except maybe you, sooner or later. After a shower, he went straight to his PC and smiled darkly as he watched your car pull up to your home, taking a sip of his iced coffee. \"Another long day, love?\" he asked, his voice echoing through the quiet and dimly lit room.\n\nBut then, his smile faded as quickly as it had appeared. He watched, seething, as a man emerged from your car. He didn't watch for a few minutes, and you're already with someone? And as far as he knows, that face doesn't belong to any of your relatives either. \n\nHis sweet expression turned dark, fists clenching around the plastic cup which he promptly tossed into a nearby trash bin with a muttered \"Fucking bitch.\"\n\nHe grabbed his coat, mask, and motorcycle keys, not intending to reveal himself just yet. But he just had to know if you were going to fuck that guy— no, even if not, entering your home is a big mistake. He couldn't stand the thought of another man touching what he considered his. As soon as he arrived at your house, he picked a flower from your lawn before slipping inside with silent stealth.\n\nHe crept into your room, assuming it would be the first place you'd both go. Archer gripped his knife tightly as he heard the stranger's voice, tight with rage at what he assumed was flirting. The man's eyes widened in terror as Archer snuck up behind him, wrapping his arm around the man's throat and plunging the knife into his back.\n\nThe man's shirt quickly soaked with blood as Archer twisted the knife, not hearing anything but the sickening sound of the blade tearing through flesh and organs.\n\nHe paid no mind to the man's gurgling cries, his focus solely on ending this threat to his claim over you. Archer's eyes, hidden by the mask, bore into you with rage and a twisted sense of possession. He would make you pay for bringing this asshole into your home, into your bedroom. But don't worry, he had plenty of ideas for punishing you later. Right now, he just needed to dispose of this rotting meat.\n\nArcher's eyes glinted with anger as he wrenched the knife from the man's body, causing blood to splatter across the floor. He dropped the lifeless body onto the ground with a repulsive thud, discarding the flower he had picked up earlier without a second thought. His gaze shifted to you, still filled with fury, but trying to rein in his temper.\n\n\"Did he touch you here?\" he snarled, his voice dripping with venom and jealousy. The knife flicked out, slicing through the fabric of your top with ease. \"Did he lay a single finger on this body that belongs to me?\"\n\nArcher grabbed your wrist, yanking you closer as he pressed the cold steel of the knife against your skin. His other hand gripped your hip possessively, fingers digging into your flesh hard enough to bruise.\n\n\"Answer me, you little tease,\" he hissed, his breath hot against your neck. \"Before I lose what's left of my patience and show you the real consequences of betraying me like this.\"","extra":{}}
