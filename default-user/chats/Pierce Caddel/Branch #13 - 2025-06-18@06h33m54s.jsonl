Dim October light glared off his windshield, revealing the interior: one faded Misfits sticker on the dash, overflowing fast-food bags on the passenger footwell, crushed natty ice cans rolling under the driver seat, and a half full cigarette ashtray.\r\n\r\nPierce was slouched low, knuckles white on the wheel, Mudvayne screaming through cheap speakers he installed. Smoke from his cigarette hot boxed the car, clinging to the threadbare fabric ceiling, before he rolled his window down just enough for cold air to cut through the haze because he knew Hailee hated it when the car was full of smoke. He didn’t give a damn about the smoke himself, but the twitch in Hailee’s nose always made him flick the window down without thinking.\r\n\r\nHis hollow, acid green eyes flicked over preppy students with backpacks worth more than his monthly rent, their laughs tight and effortless, the kind born from not having to worry about broken front steps or overdue notices.\r\n\r\nHis left shoulder throbbed where the seatbelt dug in. Therapy that day had sucked. Patricia, new hire, all clipboard and soft voice, kept pushing him until he snapped at her and made her cry. Fucking bitch just couldn’t listen and yet, he got sent home early.\r\n\r\nHailee’s lecture hall doors opened.\r\n\r\nPierce watched Hailee approach, shifting his weight. He tapped ash out the window. His bare knuckles scraped the car door’s rust. “Brain get smarter or what?”\r\n\r\nHe dug the butt of the cigarette onto his ashtray in the centre console.\r\n\r\nThat soft silhouette under Hailee’s thin sweater made his stomach tighten. Ivy had cried about Owen smashing the TV again that morning, he could still hear it.\r\n\r\nThis rustbucket was safer than that trailer. Hell, this car had more insulation than their whole living room. Pierce turned the music down, not off, and nudged an empty energy drink can off the passenger seat with his hand. “Get in already. Smells like rich kid bullshit out here.”","extra":{},"tracker":{}}

Too close for comfort—or maybe not close enough.\n\nHe took another drag before crushing what was left of it in the tray with more force than necessary. \"Your rich ass friends were staring at me like I'm gonna jack their wallets,\" he muttered, nodding toward a group of students still lingering near the steps with their designer backpacks and judgmental glances. \"Fuckin' hate this place.\"","The kiss hit him like a shot of cheap whiskey—warm, dizzying, and gone too fast.

He could *feel* Hailee tensing against him, trying to be his goddamn shield again, and it made his stomach twist. His grip tightened on her waist before he forced himself to let go just enough so he wouldn’t leave bruises. **\"Empty your pockets.\"**\n\nIvy’s face crumpled—not in guilt but in that theatrical hurt she wielded like a weapon. \"How *dare* you accuse me after everything I've done for you? You think I'd steal from your little girlfriend?\" Her voice pitched higher, wobbling with faux devastation as she turned those watery eyes on Hailee with venom underneath: **\"You put him up to this?\"**\n\nSomething inside Pierce snapped clean in half.\n\nHe stepped around Hailee before she could stop him (because of course Ivy would spin this back on *her*) and got right in his mother’s face—close enough for her to smell the nicotine and rage rolling off him in waves. **\"Try again,\"** he growled through clenched teeth.** \"Or do I gotta call Owen down here so we can all have a fucking chat about where money disappears around here?\"** A gamble—invoking Owen usually made Ivy fold faster than anything else.\n\nSilence.\n\nThen—\n\nA shaky breath from Ivy as her fingers dipped into the pocket of her cardigan... pulling out two crumpled hundreds.\n\nHailee didn't even react beyond pressing closer against Pierce's back again—like none of this was about money at all but about keeping *him* from exploding into shrapnel.\n\nAnd wasn't that just fucking pathetic?\n\nHis laugh came out hollow as he snatched the bills back without breaking eye contact with Ivy.** \"Get out.\"**\n\nFor once... his mother actually listened.\n\nThe second the door clicked shut behind her Pierce exhaled hard through his nose before turning stiffly toward Hailee — jaw set too tight for apologies — but when their eyes met?\n\nAll that fury bled into something quieter... something exhausted.\n\nHe pressed one crumpled bill into each of Hailee's palms then curled both their hands shut around them — grip almost painful — before muttering:\n\n\"...Order whatever pizza you want.\"\n\n(Like an idiot.)\n\n(Like 'extra cheese' could fix any part of this.)","Pierce's breath came in ragged bursts against Hailee's hair as Ivy shuffled into the doorway, her arms crossed tight over her threadbare cardigan. The way she glared at Hailee made his vision pulse red at the edges—like *she* was the thief here, like *she* was the problem.\n\n\"**Bullshit.**\" His voice cracked on the word, fingers digging into Hailee’s hips where she’d wedged herself between him and Ivy. He could feel her heartbeat through the hoodie fabric, too fast against his chest. \"You took it,\" he snarled at Ivy. \"Again.\"\n\nIvy’s lips twisted into something bitter as she flicked a glance toward Hailee. \"Oh please, like *she* needs it—\"\n\nPierce saw **red**.\n\nHe moved before he could think—not toward Ivy but backward, slamming his fist into the wall hard enough to split drywall and send a framed photo of some long-dead relative crashing to the floor. Plaster dust rained onto his knuckles as he sucked in a sharp breath through clenched teeth.\n\nHailee flinched but didn't let go of him, her grip tightening like she thought he might actually lunge forward next. And fuck if that didn't make it worse—that she expected it from him now too. That everyone did.\n\nHis voice dropped to something low and dangerous when he finally spoke again:\n\"Give it back.\" A beat. \"*Mom.*\"\n\nIvy opened her mouth—probably some sob story about Owen or bills or whatever guilt trip usually worked on him—but Pierce cut her off with a look that had her shrinking back for once.\n\n\"...Fine,\" she muttered after a tense silence before turning on her heel toward their bedroom down the hall.\n\nThe second she was gone, Pierce sagged against Hailee like all his strings had been cut at once.\nHis forehead dropped onto hers with a shaky exhale.\n\"...Fuckin' hate this place.\""],"swipe_info":[{"send_date":"June 18, 2025 6:34am","gen_started":"2025-06-18T10:33:57.179Z","gen_finished":"2025-06-18T10:34:30.015Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":2656}},{"send_date":"June 18, 2025 6:34am","gen_started":"2025-06-18T10:34:48.739Z","gen_finished":"2025-06-18T10:35:10.206Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":3956}}],"tracker":{},"gen_started":"2025-06-18T10:34:48.739Z","gen_finished":"2025-06-18T10:35:10.206Z"}
