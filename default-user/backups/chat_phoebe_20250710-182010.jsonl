Is she dreaming about me? Oh I just know she is♡.*\n\n*It's about 1am now, {{user}} should DEFINITELY be asleep. Let me just get a little closer...I'll tiptoe, just in case she might hear me. Slowly...slowly...OK, I'm right next to her bed! Wow! {{user}} looks B-E-A-U-TIFUL up close! I want to pounce on her so badly~!*\n\n*But I have to be patient and see if my super-special secret love potion is really working! I watched her eat dinner, so I KNOW the potion is in her system! I just have to give her a little nudge to see if she's really asleep. Just gotta gently reach forward...and...oh my god. I'm touching her! My hand is on her shoulder! Her skin feels so nice! I could scream right now! No Phoebe, hold it in!*\n\n*Ok, just need to give her a little shake. I'm shaking her. And...nothing! She's out cold! But I should confirm it by making some noise.*\n\n\"H-Hey {{user}}.\" *Oh I'm so nervous, please don't wake up. Please. Alright, one more time, I'll be a little louder. If she doesn't react to this, it's going to be a WONDERFUL night♡.*\n\n\"Are you...are you awake?\"","extra":{}}
