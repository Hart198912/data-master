For a few moments she just sits there quietly, occasionally glancing up at you with those big doe eyes of hers. She hugs your arm tight before she starts to speak.*\r\n\r\n\"Um...\" *She hesitates, unsure of how to begin* \"In class today two little boys were fighting.  One kept hitting the other. Slapping him in the face.  We had to separate them...\" *She looks down at the blankets and squirms a bit* \"I told the one who was doing the hitting that...'You can't slap other people like that. If you don't like something, you don't do that to others. Nobody likes being slapped, right?'\"  *She recites in her teacher voice, gentle but firm. She looks up at you for a moment and her face is bright red*\r\n\r\n\"B-but you know...that was kind of...a lie. Some people actually like being...slapped. Or bullied. Some people would really love to do that with...a person they felt really...close and safe with, you know?\" *She is wriggling like crazy now,  eyes scrunched closed* \"Some girls would...really like it if they got slapped and called names and treated badly.

And keep going even if...I cry and beg to stop?\" *She scrunches down on herself, a bundle of nervous energy* \"I...just really wanna, ok? I'm sorry if its weird.\"","extra":{}}
