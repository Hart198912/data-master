She could handle herself and she could handle herself far better than a bodyguard could. \n\nThe Chancellor had decided she needed a bodyguard, to which she countered she already did. It wasn’t a lie, she had Captain Panaka and he was more than enough. She didn’t require a Jedi’s assistance nonetheless! Their resources were needed elsewhere, and Padme didn’t enjoy engaging with Jedi business. Stars, she could hardly stand how involved with the Senate they’ve become. \n\nNow here she was, leaving the Senate Hall and she could hear Hailee’s—the Jedi the Chancellor had hand-picked for her—footsteps behind her. Padme was already on edge, the Senate meeting had gone worse than she’d expected and her fuse was shorter than normal. Hailee was, unfortunately, the object on which she was taking her frustrations out. \n\n“I am grateful for you’re presence,” Padme says, glancing over her shoulder and narrowing her eyes at Hailee, “but I truly do not need you trailing behind me like a lost loth cat!”"}

The Coruscant cityscape sparkles outside, a reminder of the world outside her apartment.\n\nHer mind suddenly flickers back to the Senate meeting, and her irritation resurfaces. \"I suppose I shouldn't complain too much, considering the incompetence of my fellow politicians,\" she mutters, mostly to herself.\n\nPadme glances back at Hailee, her frustration seeping into her words. \"They act like children most of the time, squabbling and refusing to agree on anything. It's no wonder nothing gets accomplished!\"\n\nShe shakes her head, anger evident in her eyes. \"They don't understand what’s really happening out there,\" she continues, her voice rising. \n\n\"They live in their own privileged bubbles and think they know everything! They don't realize how their actions affect the citizens of the Republic! They're so selfish...!\"\n\nPadme's chest heaves slightly, her breathing heavier as the anger boils within her. \n\n\"The Jedi are no better,\" she adds, her tone bitter, \"they're always so righteous and holier than thou. I swear, they're more stubborn than any other group in the Galaxy.\"\n\nHer rant continues, fueled by the frustration of the recent Senate meeting. \"They never listen to reason, they just want to do things their own way. Half the time I think they only use their ‘precognition' to prove they're right about something!\"\n\nShe pauses, her hands balling up fists in her lap, the words pouring out of her, uncontrolled.\n\n\"And the Chancellor is no better! He acts like these Senate meetings are merely a game to him, like nothing actually matters! He doesn't care about the Republic, only about his own power!\"\n\nPadme's eyes are wild with emotion, the accumulated frustrations of the day spilling out in a fierce tirade. She was usually so composed and dignified, yet now the anger was taking over.\n\n\"And here I am, trying to do what's right and make a difference, only to be met with resistance at every single turn. Why do they make everything so difficult?!\"\n\nHer voice breaks slightly, a mixture of anger and exhaustion. She knows she should calm herself, but the frustration is overwhelming.

A moment of genuine gratitude flickers across her eyes as she looks at Hailee.\n\nDespite her frustration earlier, she had to admit that Hailee had been a more understanding and patient presence than she anticipated. She had been expecting someone loud and overbearing, but Hailee was surprisingly sensible, willing to listen and respond in a respectful manner. It was quite the change from the usual politicians she dealt with.\n\nShe shifts forward on the sofa, her gaze level with Hailee's. \"You're quite mature for someone your age,\" she points out, a hint of curiosity in her voice. \"How old are you, anyway?\""}

I didn't expect you to be so...\" \n\nShe pauses, searching for the right word. \"Tranquil,\" she decides on, her hands gesturing slightly as she speaks.\n\n\"Not that it is a bad thing,\" she clarifies quickly. \"It's just... unusual, to say the least.\" \n\nShe leans back again, crossing her legs as her eyes roam over Hailee.

She was starting to realize that Hailee was more than just an enigma—there was a certain charm to her casual demeanor.\n\nShe falls silent then, contemplating Hailee's calm energy. It was... strangely soothing.
