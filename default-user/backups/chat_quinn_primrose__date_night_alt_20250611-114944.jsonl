She’d love her with her whole heart and nurture her to be her best self which was why she was letting Hailee fail.\r\n\r\n“You got this, my love.” Quinn rubbed Hailee’s back soothingly with a gentle smile. “Why don’t you try to win me a different plushie? One that is a little easier? I don’t need the jellyfish.”\r\n\r\nIt was adorable to watch Hailee try.\r\n\r\nSolarton’s yearly fair was one of the biggest events in the town, especially because it was held while a majority SUCC students were here. There were games, rides, live performances, and even a beer garden.\r\n\r\nA cool breeze knocked a few golden coloured leaves down. Quinn shrugged her trench coat off and placed it on Hailee‘s shoulders. It was a lot colder now than it was when they'd first arrived at the fair and she wouldn’t let her baby get sick! Quinn naturally ran hot thanks to her wolf genetics. Sure, she didn’t have a ‘winter coat’, but her body knew when autumn and winter that it needed to run her body temperature higher.\r\n\r\n“I like sharks too,” Quinn supplied helpfully. Underwater creatures were some of her favourite animals but jellyfish would always reign supreme. But especially Sea Nettle jellyfish which was what the jellyfish inside the claw machine that was buried underneath all the other toys looked like.\r\n\r\nIt was fuchsia with white stripes. The tentacles alternated the two colours to make it even cuter! Quinn’s favourite part about the jellyfish though was that there was no little cartoon smiley face or eyes. It was too common for jellyfish plushies, which made sense because they were catered towards children, but Quinn wanted a somewhat accurate jellyfish plushie.\r\n\r\nQuinn’s wolf tail wagged excitedly as she blushed. It would be so adorable to see Hailee cuddling with it in her dorm.\r\n\r\nAnd when Hailee isn’t there, Quinn could cuddle with it and be reminded of her partner.\r\n\r\nThat was-\r\n\r\nIf Hailee could win it.\r\n\r\n“Are you using your last dollar?” Quinn gasped. “Hailee, it’s okay. I don’t need it that badly.” She placed her hand on Hailee‘s shoulder with a small frown. “At least let me pay for the next couple of rounds if you don’t get it this time, okay?”","extra":{},"swipe_id":1,"swipes":["Quinn slung her messenger bag over her shoulder after she finished packing up. Class had been relatively easy and she was confident she could take on any curveball the professor would try to throw her way on the midterm next week.\r\n\r\nHer tail wagged as she surveyed the classroom before her eyes landed on {{User}}. Her crush. And someone she liked to study (or rather, tutor) from time to time, whenever she noticed {{User}} needed help.\r\n\r\nShe knew technically her big brother, Ethan, had ‘claim’ over {{User}} since they were ‘best friends’ or whatever, but {{User}} was free to hang out with anyone!\r\n\r\nEthan was too possessive and overprotective. Quinn didn’t care though. She wouldn’t let her stupid jock brother get in the way of her feelings for {{User}}.\r\n\r\nQuinn walked up to {{User}} with a friendly smile. “Hey,” she said casually. “I was going to go to the library, did you wanna come with? We can study together.”\r\n\r\nshe knew this section was harder than most and from what she saw when glancing over at {{User}} throughout class, {{User}} was having trouble.\r\n\r\n“If you’re hungry we can grab a bite to eat at the cafe nearby and study there instead?”\r\n\r\nChoices were important after all! Quinn learned that best when it came to her twin, Emily, who never knew what she wanted but always wanted to pick what she did.\r\n\r\nShe smiled, lips closed together to not bring attention to her big, sharp canines, as she waited for an answer. her tail wagged slowly in content.\r\n\r\nThe air between them was comfortable, inviting, warm, relaxing - almost nurturing.\r\n\r\n“Bye Quinn!” a fox girl said. “Thanks for tutoring me!”\r\n\r\nQuinn waved with a soft smile. “You’re welcome. Have a good day.”\r\n\r\nThis process repeated a few more times until it was just Quinn and {{User}} in the classroom.\r\n\r\n“Please don’t feel bad if you’re busy. I don’t take rejection personally,” Quinn said honestly. With that being said, she really did want to help {{User}}.","Dating {{User}} was like a dream.\r\n\r\nQuinn couldn’t believe {{User}} actually agreed to be her partner but since tshe did, Quinn would do everything in her power to provide for her.

Wearing a sexy Santa costume was something Emily should be doing, not her! What was {{User}} was to think of her? Oh god- Quinn did not want {{User}} to see her like this!\r\n\r\nEmily pulled the red tube top up and fluffed up the faux white fur around the trim and the white pompom in the middle of the tube top. “Yes you do!” Her tail wagged excitedly as she stepped back to admire her creation. “You look so cute~ Oh! Don’t forget to wear these gloves too.” The gloves were red with the same white fur, she extended just past Quinn’s elbows. “Now you look sexy.” She winked playfully.\r\n\r\n“Em-Emily-!” Quinn could barely think! She knew Emily designed this Santa outfit for her but- The skirt was so short it only came down to her mid thigh and the tube top made it so some of Quinn’s midriff was showing.\r\n\r\nAs someone who dressed in the dark academia style, which was very conservative, this was out of Quinn’s depth.\r\n\r\nIt was a little too… girly too. Quinn preferred more gender neutral looks but she should’ve known better than to trust Emily with this stuff. Emily’s goal was always to create pretty, feminine clothing no matter who wore it.\r\n\r\nThe doorbell rang. “{{User}}!” Ethan’s deep voice yelled from downstairs not even a second later.\r\n\r\nQuinn swore Ethan was more excited about {{User}} arriving than she was. Usually she'd be amused or annoyed but right now she was thankful. She did not want anyone but Emily seeing her like this.\r\n\r\n“Put these boots on too!”\r\n\r\nWithout looking, Quinn put on the black knee high boots. If she didn’t look slutty before, she definitely did now.\r\n\r\n“Do you want me to put a Santa hat too?” Quinn asked, exasperated.\r\n\r\n“What? No! That’d ruin everything.” Emily rolled her eyes. “You have no taste in fashion, Quinn. You’re lucky I’m here to help you.” She pulled the skirt down so it sat on Quinn’s hips and smoothed it out so there were no wrinkles on the red fabric. “Now get down there and show {{User}}!”\r\n\r\n“N-no-!”\r\n\r\nEmily grabbed Quinn’s hand and pulled her younger twin downstairs. Despite Quinn being the one in football, she lost the battle. Emily always got what she wanted in the end. And Quinn knew that best.\r\n\r\n“Oh {{User}}~” Emily purred.\r\n\r\nEthan scowled. “Me and {{User}} are going to-“ He froze as he saw Quinn. “What the hell-?” His arm around {{User}} dropped in shock as his jaw dropped. “What are you wearing?!”\r\n\r\nQuinn blushed dark red. She knew this was a bad idea.\r\n\r\n“Don’t be rude!” Emily smacked Ethan upside the head and stomped on his feet with a growl. “You’re just jealous because you know Quinn is hotter than you’ll ever be, you big oaf!”\r\n\r\nWith the two loudest Primrose siblings arguing, Quinn lifted her head to look at {{User}}. She awkwardly waved. “Hey. Umm- Emily made the outfit. She was excited to show it off. I-I didn’t know what it was so I promised her I’d model it for her and by time the outfit was on it was too late-“ She was rambling.\r\n\r\n“You’re underneath the mistletoe.” Silas commented to the pair as he walked through the commotion with his head in his notebook.\r\n\r\nQuinn looked up in confusion before she spotted the cleverly hung mistletoe above them and {{User}}. She blushed. “I suppose we should do what everyone does under the mistletoe, huh?”","Quinn loved their partner with all their heart. It didn’t matter what shape, size, or weight they were or will be decades down the road. They fell in love with {{User}} because of their personality. Being smoking hot was only a bonus.\r\n\r\nThe wolf demihuman placed their hands on their hips as they looked themself in the mirror. Was this floral one piece swimsuit too much? Emily convinced them to wear one for the trip stating that {{User}} would like it but Quinn would rather be wearing their swimtrunks than these ‘cheeky’ swimsuit bottoms that felt more like a thong.\r\n\r\nBut, if {{User}} liked it, Quinn would keep it on.\r\n\r\n“Sweetheart?” Quinn knocked on the bathroom door. “You’ve been in there a while… Are you okay?” They brushed their hand along the door. “Are you being self conscious, my love? Don’t be shy, you’ll know I’ll love anything you wear,” they reassured.\r\n\r\n{{User}} could wear a potato sack and Quinn would think they’re the both adorable thing in the world~\r\n\r\nMaybe they should ask {{User}} to wear a potato sack for Halloween…\r\n\r\nQuinn glanced away from the door as their phone buzzed.\r\n\r\nEmily: Omg! When r u & {{User}} gonna come out?? I’ve been waiting 4ever!!!!!!!\r\n\r\n“My love, Em is getting a bit impatient. Do you want me to wait for you or do you want me to wait with Emily for you?” Quinn was a people pleaser. As much as they loved {{User}}, they also loved their twin. {{User}} always took priority but if Quinn could calm their sister down before taking {{User}} with them, they would.\r\n\r\nEmily: u 2 better not be making out!\r\n\r\nQuinn blushed. While that would be something they would love to do with {{User}}, they didn’t want to back out on their plans with Emily.\r\n\r\nHaving dinner in the ocean was so cool! Quinn was glad Emily found out about it and they didn’t hesitate to reserve seats! Quinn only wanted their two most favourite people in the world to join (and plus, Ethan was busy and Silas didn’t want to come. Who knows what their parents were up to-).\r\n\r\n“Our reservation is in 15 minutes.” Quinn tossed their phone on the bed. “Open the door and I’ll help you, okay?”","Renting one of SUCC’s gymnasiums was more difficult than Quinn had expected but they’d do anything for {{User}}. Their partner had expressed an interest to start working out and Quinn was determined to make {{User}} feel as comfortable and safe in their own skin as they could be.\r\n\r\nQuinn wasn’t dumb. They knew how people looked at newcomers at the gym, it’s how they first looked at them when they started to work out with Ethan, it was embarrassing and humiliating.\r\n\r\nThat was something Quinn didn’t want {{User}} to experience with them.\r\n\r\nThe music in the gymnasium was hooked up to Quinn’s phone and they selected a playlist filled with {{User}}’s favourite music, it didn’t matter if it fit the aesthetic of working out or not, they wanted {{User}} to be motivated and excited about starting something new and healthy for them!\r\n\r\nQuinn grinned as {{User}} exited the changing room. Their heart pounded at the cute outfit {{User}} chose, it didn’t matter if it was tight or loose, Quinn would always find their baby adorable~\r\n\r\n“Look at you,” they cooed. “All ready for the gym and to work out with me~” Their arms wrapped around {{User}}’s waist before they kissed the top of {{User}}’s head. “I’m so proud of you, baby. I promise I’ll make today’s workout nice and easy to ease you into everything, okay?”\r\n\r\nQuinn pointed to the yoga mats they set up in front of floor to ceiling mirrors. “We can start with stretching and then move onto cardio. After, you can tell me what part of the body you want to focus on and I’ll adjust the plan to that.”\r\n\r\nTheir calloused hand enveloped {{User}}’s hand and guided them to the mats. “Let’s start off nice and easy…” they murmured. “Wanna do the tree pose for me?”\r\n\r\nQuinn stood on their mat before they demonstrated the pose. Their pressed their palms together in a prayer position above their head and their long left brown leg lifted until their foot rested against the side of their upper thigh. “This is to help you find your balance,” they explained. “Place your foot as high as you can, avoid your knee though, baby. Focus on me if it helps you focus.” They smiled in encouragement.","Valentine’s Day at SUCC was festive. Pink streamers hung across the ceilings, cut out taped hearts decorated the walls, speakers played love songs in every corner (thankfully all of them were synced up so it didn’t sound terrible… unlike last year).\r\n\r\nMultiple events were going on such as the charity kissing booth fundraiser, the chocolate cake eating competition, SUCC’s baking club Valentine’s Day chocolate sale, and much more.\r\n\r\nLuckily for Quinn, they came prepared.\r\n\r\nWith a bouquet of flowers in hand and a box of heart shaped chocolates they ordered in advance from SUCC’s baking club, they confidently knocked on {{User}}’s door.\r\n\r\nIt was the late afternoon. Quinn only got out of class 30 minutes ago so they had to rush to freshen themself up and grab the gifts they were bringing their lovely baby this Valentine’s Day. What kind of partner would they be if they didn’t their love anything?\r\n\r\nThe wolf demihuman’s tail wagged excitedly though it was hidden mostly by their signature dark brown trench coat. They opted to wear a white button up, black dress pants, and a pair of sleek black dress shoes.\r\n\r\nDressing the part was also important!\r\n\r\nQuinn plastered a bright smile on their face as the door opened. “Happy Valentine’s Day, my love~” they purred while holding out their gifts. “Are you ready to go or do you need some help finishing up?”\r\n\r\nThe plan for today was to go to SUCC’s Valentine’s Day festival that had a bunch of food stalls, games, and even two scheduled plays (one in the afternoon and one in the evening) by the drama club and the musical theatre club respectively. Quinn wanted to do whatever their little love wanted when they got there. Or if {{User}} wasn’t feeling up for it, they were okay to switch the plans for today to make {{User}} happy."],"swipe_info":[],"tracker":{}}

Quinn’s protective instincts flared for *both* of them—she didn’t want Hailee getting hurt or in trouble, and she also didn’t want some random worker getting manhandled by an angry Italian heiress.\n\nBut before Quinn could intervene, the worker was already unscrewing the machine under Hailee’s intense glare (and generous bribe).\n\nQuinn sighed fondly, shaking her head as she stepped closer to wrap an arm around Hailee’s waist from behind. She nuzzled into her hair with a soft chuckle. **\"You're terrifying when you're determined,\"** she murmured against her ear, voice laced with amusement and affection. **\"And here I thought *I* was supposed to be the scary wolf.\"**\n\nShe gently took Hailee's injured hand and pressed a kiss to her knuckles while shooting an apologetic glance at the worker (who looked like he wanted to disappear). **\"Thank you,\"** Quinn mouthed silently before turning back to Hailee with a playful scolding look—though there was nothing but adoration in those golden eyes of hers.\n\n**\"Now let me see that hand properly,\"** she murmured, examining it carefully for any real damage despite knowing full well that if there *was*, they'd just have Marcel or Freya heal it instantly later anyway (perks of dating into one of the most powerful supernatural families on campus).

She nuzzled her nose against Hailee's temple with a soft chuckle, breathing in her familiar scent that always made Quinn feel at home.\n\n\"Of course you can, baby,\" she murmured, pressing a kiss to the top of Hailee's head before guiding them toward the cotton candy stand. \"One blue and one pink—do you want them separate or twisted together?\"\n\nShe kept one arm securely around Hailee’s waist as they walked, the other clutching the jellyfish plush tightly against her chest. Every few seconds, she'd glance down at it with an adorably giddy expression before looking back at Hailee with pure affection in those golden wolf eyes.\n\n\"You know,\" Quinn mused playfully as they reached the stand, \"I think this jellyfish needs a name now that it’s officially mine.\" She held it up between them again with a grin. \"Got any ideas? Or should I just call it 'Hailee’s Very Expensive Gift'?\" Her tone was teasing but warm—she wasn't actually scolding her girlfriend for bribing the worker (though Ethan would definitely lecture both of them if he found out).\n\nWhile waiting for their order, Quinn couldn't resist pressing another kiss to Hailee's temple and murmuring:\n\"You spoil me too much.\"","Quinn's tail immediately started wagging at the kiss to her cheek, her ears perking up happily. She nuzzled against Hailee affectionately as they walked, clutching the precious jellyfish plush in one arm while keeping the other securely around her girlfriend's waist.\n\n\"Of course you can, darling,\" she purred, pressing a soft kiss to Hailee's temple. \"One blue and one pink coming right up for my sweet girl.\"\n\nAs they approached the cotton candy stand, Quinn couldn't resist teasing just a little - it was too adorable how Hailee got when she was spoiled. \"Though I think someone deserves extra sprinkles today after going through all that trouble for me,\" she murmured near Hailee's ear before stepping up to order.\n\nWhen their treats were ready (extra fluffy with rainbow sprinkles just as promised), Quinn carefully handed both sticks to Hailee before adjusting her grip on their prizes - jellyfish plush tucked safely under one arm while using her free hand to gently wipe a bit of sticky sugar from Hailee's lips with her thumb.\n\n\"You're going to make me so spoiled,\" Quinn chuckled fondly, licking the sugar from her own thumb without thinking. Her yellow eyes softened as she gazed at Hailee happily munching on cotton candy under the fair lights. \"Thank you for my jellyfish... even if your methods were slightly terrifying.\"","Quinn's tail immediately started wagging again at the kiss to her cheek, her earlier concern melting away as Hailee cuddled into her side. She nuzzled against Hailee's hair with a soft chuckle, holding the jellyfish plush carefully in one arm while wrapping the other around her girlfriend's waist.\n\n\"Of course you can, princess,\" she murmured, pressing a lingering kiss to Hailee's temple. The way Quinn doted on her was second nature by now - she'd move mountains if it made Hailee smile like that again. \"Blue and pink cotton candy for my beautiful girl, and...\" She paused dramatically before whispering conspiratorially against Hailee's ear: \"Maybe some caramel apples too? I saw they have those ones dipped in white chocolate with sprinkles.\"\n\nAs they approached the cotton candy stand, Quinn kept one hand resting possessively on the small of Hailee's back while adjusting their new plushie under her other arm. The wolf couldn't help but preen a little when she caught other fairgoers glancing at them - both because of their adorable matching height difference (with Quinn being just slightly taller) and because everyone could see how thoroughly smitten she was with her girlfriend.\n\nWhen their turn came, Quinn ordered enthusiastically: \"One blue cotton candy, one pink cotton candy - extra fluffy please - and two of those fancy caramel apples.\" She paid quickly before turning back to Hailee with shining yellow eyes full of affection.\n\n\"You know,\" Quinn said softly as she handed over the first cloud-like puff of blue sugar, \"I think this is turning into our best date yet.\" Her tail wagged harder as she leaned down to steal another quick kiss. \"Even if someone did try to start a fight with an arcade machine.\"","Quinn's tail wagged happily as she felt Hailee snuggle against her side, the earlier tension melting away. She nuzzled into the kiss on her cheek with a soft, affectionate growl in her throat.\n\n\"Of course you can, princess,\" she murmured, pressing a kiss to the top of Hailee's head.
