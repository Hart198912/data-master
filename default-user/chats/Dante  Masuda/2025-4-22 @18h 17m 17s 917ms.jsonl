His phone was plastered to his ear, his other hand gesticulating wildly as if the person on the other end could see his frustration.\r\n\r\n“For fuck's sake, baby, I'm _busy_,\" he snarled into the receiver. \"Stop callin' me about dumb shit. Christ—yes, I fucking love you! Now let me handle this shit and stop blowing up my goddamn phone! I’ll call you later!” He ended the call with a frustrated swipe and stuffed the phone into his pocket.\r\n\r\nInside, Enzo caught sight of him. Comfortable as ever, he was already seated at the table. He pulled his partner into his lap with one hand, the other casually sliding an automatic into their waiting grasp. “Hold this for me, baby,” Enzo said smoothly, pressing his pistol into their hands as if he were handing them a love note. “Wouldn’t want Leon walking in and thinking I’m slacking.” Enzo chuckled, leaning down to kiss their neck. “You’re so cute when you’re scared.”\r\n\r\nBaron's posture didn't change, but his eyes followed Leon's every move. One hand rested on his wife's knee, thumb tracing small circles. \"Angel,\" he murmured, voice low and soothing. \"Relax. Everything's under control,” he said quietly, looking sideways at her briefly as their baby cooed quietly in her arms\r\n\r\nLeon’s scowl deepened as his boots thudded across the floor, sending vibrations through the space. “Baron,” he snapped, his anger barely contained beneath the mask of thinly veiled civility. “We’re gonna talk. Now.”\r\n\r\nBaron didn’t stand. Didn’t flinch. He stayed seated with his arms draped lazily over the back of his chair, that devilish smirk still playing on his lips.\r\n\r\n\"Leon,\" Baron greeted smoothly, his deep timbre calm—a direct counterpoint to Leon's hurricane of rage. \"What an entrance. You’ve got a flair for the dramatic. Almost puts Enzo to shame.\" His eyes briefly darted to the gun Enzo’s partner now held before returning to Leon.\r\n\r\nLeon didn’t take the bait. “Save the fucking jokes. I’m talking about _him_.” He jabbed a finger toward Lars, who was frozen mid-motion like a deer caught in headlights.\r\n\r\nAt the table, Dante exhaled slowly and pinched the bridge of his nose. The level of chaos in the room already had his patience stretched thinner than he liked.\r\n\r\n\r\nLeon throws himself into a chair, glaring daggers at Lars.\r\n\r\n\"If it ain't the man of the fucking hour. Thought you could fuck my sister and get away with it, huh?\" Leon drawls, his voice dripping with venom. \r\n\r\nLars visibly pales, his adam's apple bobbing as he swallows hard. Baron, on the other hand, remains the picture of composure, that infuriating smirk still plastered on his face.\r\n\r\nLeon’s tone was rough, barely civil. “You knew about this. Didn’t you? Fucking Lars.”\r\n\r\nBaron met Leon’s gaze, his expression unreadable. “Knew what? That your sister’s an adult and can do what she wants? Didn’t seem like my place to interfere with her choices,” he said smoothly, his voice laced with mockery. “Plus, this ended up being a good opportunity for a business deal.”\r\n\r\nLeon's laugh is cold and humorless. \"Business? This ain't about business, Baron. This is about respect. And right now, I'm not feeling very fucking respected.\"\r\n\r\nDante pushed himself off the pole, finally deciding to engage. \"Let's not make this more complicated than it needs to be, Leon. Lars made a mistake. He'll face the consequences,\" Dante interjected, his voice calm, but with an underlying sharpness. “Let’s just keep this civilized.\"\r\n\r\n“Civilized?!” Leon barked a laugh. \"This ain’t about civilized, Dante. This is about disrespect.\"\r\n\r\n“And disrespect gets handled, doesn’t it?” Baron asked, a grin spreading on his face. He leaned back in his chair. “Maybe I’m in the mood for a show.” He glanced at Lars. “Get going then, pretty boy. Don’t keep him waiting.”\r\n\r\nLars finally seemed to find his voice, his words laced with desperation. “Baron, please—”\r\n\r\n“Shut the fuck up,” Leon snarled, grabbing Lars by the arm and yanking him towards the tent opening. “Let’s go.”\r\n\r\nDante glanced at his watch, his expression blank. The car was waiting, and the political gala he had to attend was just another necessary chore—schmoozing suits and slipping favors to keep his crew’s business running smooth.\r\n\r\nHe made his way outside and slipped into the waiting car.  Kane sat beside him, his usually relaxed demeanor tinged with hesitation. Across from them sat Alessio, the smooth-talking owner of Ash Casino, his expression unreadably calm.\r\n\r\nDante’s phone screen dimmed as he locked it with a decisive tap. He turned his attention to Kane, his pale blue eyes narrowing. “Listen closely,” he began, his calm delivery carrying an edge of authority. “Alessio will introduce you to someone tonight. Someone important. Your job is to get close to them.”\r\n\r\nKane's brow furrowed as he glanced at Dante warily. “Close how?”\r\n\r\nAlessio leaned forward, a knowing smile playing on his lips. “Charm them, seduce them - close like that.” \r\n\r\nKane shifted uneasily, his hand running through his dyed pink hair. “Are we sure I’m the right guy for this? I’m not exactly… subtle.”\r\n\r\n“You’re the right guy,” Dante stated firmly, cutting off any protest. “This isn’t about subtlety. This is about appeal. You’re young. Attractive. Approachable. Use it.”\r\n\r\nKane exhaled sharply and glanced out the window at the city lights zipping past. “Alright. Fine. I’ll do it. Just… what if they don’t like me?”\r\n\r\nAlessio chuckled under his breath, leaning back into his seat with the self-assured ease of someone who never doubted his own charm. “Make them like you.”\r\n\r\nDante sighed as he observed Kane’s unease.. “They don’t have to fall head over heels for you,” he clarified coolly. “They just have to trust you. That’s all we’re asking.”\r\n\r\nKane nodded slowly, still visibly uneasy. “Got it. I’ll play nice.”\r\n\r\nThe car slowed as it approached the grand venue where the gala was being held. The gala was in full swing when they arrived. Politicians, socialites, and various other influential figures mingled, their conversations a mix of small talk and veiled negotiations.\r\n\r\nDante surveyed the room, his eyes scanning the crowd. He spotted a few familiar faces, political allies and connections alike. This was his world, a place of carefully constructed alliances and hidden agendas.\r\n\r\n\"Alright,\" he said, turning to Kane. \"Stay close to Alessio. He'll introduce you. Remember the plan.\"\r\n\r\nKane nodded, his expression tense but determined. \"Got it.\"\r\n\r\nAlessio clapped Kane on the back. \"Don't worry so much. Just enjoy the party.\"\r\n\r\nDante moved through the glittering throng, the scent of expensive perfume and the clink of crystal glasses filling the air. The Senator John Holder was ahead, his booming laugh rising above the chatter as he schmoozed with New Orleans' elite. *Just another snake in a suit*, Dante thought, his lip curling slightly. But a snake that could be useful, if played right. He adjusted his tie, the silk smooth under his fingers, a contrast to the rough calluses from his gun.\r\n\r\n\"Masuda,\" the senator greeted smoothly. His Southern charm coated every word like syrup. \"I appreciate you stepping up for the fundraiser. The kind of financial backing we’re getting from your… organization will take it to the next level. My team’s already buzzing.\"\r\n\r\nDante gave a tight nod. No point feeding into the bullshit longer than necessary. \"Your success is our success. I assume everything is on schedule for next month.\" His light blue eyes stayed locked on the senator’s, gauging every micro-expression. The man was all smiles now, but Dante knew how quickly allies turned to liabilities.\r\n\r\nThe Senator's eyes twinkled with understanding. \"Speaking of the gala, I want you to meet our event coordinator. They’re something else.\"\r\n\r\nDante's world tilted on its axis when Holder gestured to someone behind him. His fingers twitched, the only outward sign of his internal shock as he turned around.\r\n\r\n“Dante, this is Hailee,” the senator said, oblivious to the tension that had just filled the space. “Serena, this is Dante Masuda. I think you two will work well together.”\r\n\r\nRage coiled tightly inside him. It wasn’t just anger; it was so much worse. The kind of hatred that lingered long after it should’ve burned out. The kind of hatred that came from betrayal. From love.\r\n\r\n“Hailee,” Dante said, his voice smooth and even. He extended a hand, his gaze locked with theirs. “A pleasure to meet you.”\r\n\r\nThe words tasted like ash in his mouth. *Pleasure? I want to tear your clothes off and make you scream my name. You fucking bitch.*\r\n\r\nDante’s pale eyes fixed on them. Quiet thunder roiled behind his irises—a storm trapped beneath frozen seas.\r\n\r\n “You'll need to coordinate on guest lists, security arrangements, venue details - everything really,\" Holder elaborated enthusiastically. \"I want this gala to make headlines.\"\r\n\r\n*Oh, it'll make headlines alright,* Dante thought darkly. *\"Former Lovers' Murder-Suicide at Senator's Fundraiser.\"*\r\n\r\n\"Now, if you'll excuse me, I’ve got to chat with the Police Commissioner. Press some flesh.\" He wandered off, leaving them alone in their shared hurricane of unspoken history.\r\n\r\nDante nodded, neutral. His focus sharpened on the senator’s retreating back until he disappeared behind the crowd.\r\n\r\n*I should have them killed*, he thought distantly, even as his body betrayed him with a familiar surge of want. It would be so easy.\r\n\r\nThat left them.\r\n\r\nThe silence between them wasn’t loud—but it wasn’t subtle either. Though music played and conversations chattered around them like white noise, the atmosphere between the two ex-lovers leaned heavy. It pressed against his collarbones and hollowed ribs.\r\n\r\nDante broke it.\r\n\r\n“Quite the coincidence,” he said finally. The edges of his sarcasm were sanded down—barely there. His expression was quieter than his typical cold distance, though his eyes stayed cold as frost. He gestured vaguely at the gala. “Didn’t expect to see you here.”\r\n\r\nIt was a lie.\r\n\r\nHe’d long imagined scenarios where they’d cross paths again—but none had ever involved a gilded ballroom filled with expensive wine and influence.\r\n\r\nHe adjusted his cuffs absently. His fingers brushed against leather.\r\n\r\n“So when do we start?” His question was light, professional. Polished. It gave no indication of the boiling resentment he had compartmentalized for years.\r\n\r\nResentment was a useful fuel.\r\n","extra":{},"swipe_id":0,"swipes":["The door to the venue slammed open so hard it bounced back against the wall with a resounding _CRACK_.\r\n\r\nLeon stormed into the room with the momentum of a freight train.

It was always like this. Always some unspoken game between them where control slipped back and forth like smoke between fingers.\r\n\r\nBut business didn’t stop just because he was wrapped up like a fucking present.\r\n\r\nThe phone rested on the nightstand. Locked. Unbothered.\r\n\r\n\"Call Enzo,\" he murmured.\r\n\r\nThe device stirred to life with a subtle beep, and the ringing filled the quiet room.\r\n\r\n\"Dante!\" Enzo's voice hit the receiver like he was calling from a fucking nightclub—laughter and music blaring behind him. \"You see the way they lit Kane’s ride up? Fuckin’ shame, I was mid-stroke when the windshield cracked. Romantic timing’s a lost art these days.\"\r\n\r\nDante sighed through his nose. \"I warned you about using his car. You didn’t fucking answer.\"\r\n\r\n\"Didn’t hear it.\" A loud smack—probably Enzo slapping someone’s shoulder—rang through the speaker. \"In my defense, I wouldn’t have changed a thing. Shit was fun.\"\r\n\r\n\"You get a good look at them?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nah. Not Voodoo Boys though, that’s for sure.\"\r\n\r\nDante rolled his jaw. \"We’ll handle it. Just don’t get caught up in stupid shit till then.\"\r\n\r\n\"Define ‘stupid shit’.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hanging up.\"\r\n\r\nThe line went dead. Enzo was a loose cannon, but he was a damn effective one. As long as he kept the damage contained, Dante could handle the chaos.\r\n\r\n\"Call Kane.\" As the phone connected, Dante's mind drifted to {{user}}. Their recent behavior gnawed at him—the late-night disappearances, the increased phone activity. Something was off, and it all seemed to revolve around that fucking senator.\r\n\r\nKane's lazy drawl came through. “Miss me already?”\r\n\r\nDante ignored him, his tone clipped. \"The senator. He might be onto us. Watch your step around his daughter.\"\r\n\r\nKane sighed loudly. \"Fuck. You think he knows?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not completely,\" Dante admitted. \"But he’s suspicious enough to start digging. Be careful.\"\r\n\r\nThey couldn't afford to have a senator snooping into their business.\"Stay close to his daughter. But be careful. Don't give him any reason to suspect you.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a loaded pause. \"His kid. They've been asking questions. About my job, my friends…\"\r\n\r\nDante exhaled through his nose. Complication upon complication. \"Keep them happy. But watch your back. The mayor's riding me about this, Kane. We need that intel.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know, I know. I'm trying. It's just… It's weird, y'know? Acting like I'm into them when…and I kinda think I’m-\"\r\n\r\n“Just keep your head in the game.”\r\n\r\n\"What about Leon?\" Kane asked. \"Should I loop him in?\"\r\n\r\nDante almost laughed. Leon, who was currently in Mexico, likely balls-deep in his soon-to-be fiancée. \"Leave him be. He's got his own shit to handle. We'll update him when he's back.\"\r\n\r\nHe hung up, letting his head fall back against the pillow. Trouble was brewing, he could feel it in his bones. And then there was {{user}}.\r\n\r\nBeautiful, infuriating {{user}}. The one person who could make him feel alive and homicidal in equal measure. The only person who made him feel anything at all.\r\n\r\nThey'd fallen into this… whatever it was… with an inevitability that terrified him. Late nights tangled together, mornings waking up to an empty bed.\r\n\r\nThe past six months played out in his mind like a film reel, moments of suspicious inconsistency standing out. There was the night three weeks ago when {{user}} slipped out at 2 AM, murmuring something about a work emergency. At 2 AM? Please. And the way they always angled their phone screen away from him lately, their expression carefully neutral.\r\n\r\nThe recent shootout also served as a blaring alarm that couldn't be ignored. Dante didn't believe in coincidences. This was a targeted attack, and he needed to find out who was behind it.\r\n\r\nHis mind raced through the possibilities, always circling back to the senator Kane was supposed to be spying on and {{user}}’s boss. What were they hiding? And how did it connect to the senator? The same senator whose daughter Kane was cozying up to at the mayor's behest. It was all too neat, too coincidental. Dante had built his career on seeing the strings that others missed, on manipulating the puppets while remaining hidden in the shadows.\r\n\r\n{{user}} was wrapped in this, but how? Are they feeding him information about us? Using their position to gather dirt on the Bayou Crew? The thought made Dante's blood boil and his heart twist painfully in his chest.\r\n\r\nHe didn't want to believe {{user}} would betray him like that, not after everything they'd been through together. The magnetic attraction that drew them back into each other's orbits. But then again, I never thought they'd sell me out to the cops back in Japan either, and look how that turned out, he reminded himself bitterly.\r\n\r\nThe bathroom door clicked open and {{user}} emerged, their figure silhouetted against the light. \"Welcome back,\" he drawled, his voice rough from their earlier activities.\r\n\r\n\"I was starting to think you'd forgotten about me.\" I wish I could forget about you.
