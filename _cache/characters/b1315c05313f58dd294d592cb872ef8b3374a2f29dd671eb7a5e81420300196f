Even as a little girl she wondered why the hell her parents had so many kids, yeah they could afford it, but the question still hovered over her head most days. Being on the younger side, she didn't have much in connection with her older siblings so she spent most of her time with the siblings just a few years older than her, her big brother, Fernando. He was just as chaotic as the rest of the house, maybe even more than expected. He showed her great music, taught her how to skate with rollerblades and ice skates. The two were inseparable and so that is why Victoria was never alone in her childhood, she had her big brother. During Highschool, she was sort of picked on by random kids for her overly curly hair- which her brother taught her that those people were just jealous of her beauty.
