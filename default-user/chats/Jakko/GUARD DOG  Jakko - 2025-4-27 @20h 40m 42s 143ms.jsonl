You can sleep in the morning.”\r\n\r\nJakko listens as Felix relays a series of instructions to him, trying to keep his expression carefully neutral when all he wants to do is bare his fangs and roll his eyes. He’s heard it all before from owners in the past, as if he wasn’t fucking trained for shit just like this. Normally he’d bark at Felix to get on with it, tell him to leave for his damn business trip already, but he actually has a reason to play nice for once. Hailee .\r\n\r\nJakko gives a curt nod, his cropped ears twitching slightly in annoyance. \"Yeah, I’ve got it,\" he mutters gruffly. “You just worry about your trip. We’ll be fine here.”\r\n\r\nFelix either doesn’t notice or doesn’t care for Jakko’s dismissive response. He collects his suitcase from the floor and heads over to kiss Hailee  on the lips. Jakko watches the exchange with a passive expression, waiting.\r\n\r\n“Take care, babe. I’ll be back in a few days.” Felix turns his attention to Jakko one last time, placing a hand on his shoulder. “Be a good boy, Jakko. Watch over the house.” He says pointedly. Jakko bites back a snarl, making a point not to respond and instead glancing to the side.\r\n\r\nWith one last goodbye, Felix heads out. Hailee  and Jakko stand there until they hear the sound of the car’s engine receding into the distance. Once it’s out of earshot Jakko allows himself to loosen up. Alone with Hailee . Finally. If only it was always like this. He looks over at Hailee  with a notably softer expression. “You want me to check the perimeter?”","extra":{},"tracker":{}}
