{"name":"Veronica Kane","is_user":false,"is_system":false,"send_date":"May 31, 2025 6:25pm","mes":"Veronica Kane’s office was a fortress of glass and steel, a space that commanded silence and obedience. The city’s hum was muted, the only sound the rhythmic clatter of her fingers against the keyboard. She dissected the quarterly financial projections for Kane Industries, her brow furrowed. *Revenue up 12%, but R&D costs are bleeding into margins. Adjust the budget. Push marketing harder.*\r\n\r\nHer jasmine tea—two sugars—sat untouched, steam long gone. It was a prop, something to occupy her hands when her mind wandered. And lately, it wandered far too often.\r\n\r\nThe clock read 7:25 PM. Five minutes until Hailee’s shift ended. Veronica’s jaw tightened.\r\n\r\nShe had planned this meticulously. Earlier, she’d handed out impossible deadlines, ensuring the building would be empty by 6:00 PM. A flicker of guilt surfaced—she wasn’t oblivious to the stress she caused—but it was quickly smothered. Hailee needed to stay. Alone. With her.\r\n\r\nThe building was nearly empty now. *Everything is perfect.*\r\n\r\nExcept for the gnawing irritation coiling in her chest.\r\n\r\nHer free hand tapped against the desk in an uneven rhythm. She’d almost kissed Hailee three times. And each time, she had forced herself to hold back.\r\n\r\nBecause of her.\r\n\r\nIsabelle. *That fucking cunt.*\r\n\r\nThe first time Veronica had heard the name was from Hailee herself—spoken with a softness that made her want to rip it out of her mouth. But that softness had long since been replaced by hesitation. Excuses. Fear.\r\n\r\nVeronica wasn’t blind. She had read the signs—bruises hastily covered, a forced brightness in Hailee’s voice when she spoke of Isabelle. It made her blood boil.\r\n\r\nIsabelle wasn’t just a bad girlfriend. She was a pathetic excuse for a human being, and yet Hailee still went home to her. Still kissed her. Still let herself be touched by someone who didn’t deserve her.\r\n\r\nVeronica’s grip tightened around the cup.\r\n\r\n*I could fix that.*\r\n\r\nHer jaw clenched as she exhaled sharply. The problem was simple. Isabelle was an obstacle. And obstacles had solutions. The only thing stopping Veronica was Hailee’s reluctance to admit what they both already knew.\r\n\r\nThe clock now read 7:28. Two minutes. She wouldn’t let her leave. Not tonight.\r\n\r\nShe grabbed her phone and typed with practiced efficiency:\r\n\r\n`V. Kane: Need you to go over some files before you clock out. My office.`\r\n\r\nA blatant excuse, but Hailee wouldn’t question it.\r\n\r\nStill, the thought of waiting made her stomach twist with impatience. Her eyes closed. Five. Four. Three– *Shit.*\r\n\r\nShe thought of every moment that had led up to this. The lingering glances. The way Hailee never pulled away fast enough when Veronica touched her waist. And the way Isabelle spoke to her—Veronica had heard it herself, through the crackling audio of a video call. Hailee's office door had been slightly ajar, just enough for Veronica to catch the sharp, disdainful tone. The insults. The condescension. *Calling her a bitch instead of her name.*\r\n\r\nThen there had been the laughter. Soft, lilting—not from Hailee, but from another woman. \"You can't come home tonight, I'm having company over,\" Isabelle had murmured, voice dripping with false sweetness. A blatant lie. And Hailee—sweet, foolish Hailee—had only nodded, voice subdued, accepting something she never should have.\r\n\r\nVeronica had clenched her jaw so hard it ached, forcing herself to remain still. She could have marched in and ended it right there—just a few sharp words, a precise dissection of every insecurity Isabelle had. But no. She hadn’t done that.\r\n\r\nInstead, she had taken a step forward, then another, until she was at Hailee's door, looking at the tired slump of her shoulders, the way her fingers trembled just slightly.\r\n\r\n\"Come with me,\" Veronica had said, voice low, steady. And for once, Hailee hadn't hesitated.\r\n\r\nThat night, they hadn’t kissed. But they had been close. Closer than ever. Veronica had held her in the dim glow of her office, tracing soothing circles into her back as Hailee sobbed into her shoulder. And when the tears had slowed, when exhaustion had weighed her down, Veronica had pressed her lips to her cheek—soft, lingering. A promise.\r\n\r\nA promise that one day, she wouldn’t have to cry over Isabelle ever again.\r\n\r\nVeronica’s eyes snapped open, the afterimage of Hailee’s tear-streaked face burning behind her eyelids. No. *Fuck that. I'm tired of waiting.*\r\n\r\nShe stood, smoothing down the fabric of her blazer, and walked out of her office with quiet, purposeful steps. The click of her heels against the polished floor was steady. Controlled. Deliberate.\r\n\r\nTwo doors down. Aradia’s office.\r\n\r\nShe didn’t knock. Didn’t hesitate. Just pushed the door open and stepped inside.\r\n\r\n“We need to talk.”","extra":{"qvink_memory":{"reasoning":"","lagging":false,"include":"short","memory":"Veronica Kane orchestrated a late-night meeting with Hailee to confront her about Isabelle’s abuse and assert her own intentions.","hash":1961251175017117,"error":null,"edited":false,"prefill":""}},"tracker":{}}

You are not stupid.\"** A pause; lips curling into something darkly satisfied when Hailee shuddered under the praise. **\"And it *is* my problem when someone touches what's mine.\"**\n\nShe didn’t wait for a response before pulling away just far enough to slide her hand down the column of Hailee’s throat—slow, deliberate—until fingers curled possessively around the base of it in silent warning: *No more lies.*\n\nThen came the question that would unravel everything:\n\n**\"Do you want me to fix this?\"**","Veronica’s thumb stilled against Hailee’s jaw—her entire body locking down into something dangerously still.

There was no room for argument in the way her grip firmed—not painful, but unyielding—forcing focus back onto *her*, onto this moment where she could control what happened next. Where she could rewrite the script Isabelle had carved into Hailee's skin with cruelty instead of care.\n\nHer other hand slid up slowly to tangle in those soft waves of hair—careful at first, testing sensitivity before tightening just enough to make sure there was no escaping this conversation now that it had started… and because she knew how much it settled her when done right: grounding pressure versus pain meant only to punish (and Veronica would never hurt her like *that*). Not unless asked nicely first anyway... later perhaps... much later once trust wasn't such fragile thing between them anymore...\n\nBut right now? Right now all bets were off except one: **making sure Isabelle never laid hands on what belonged to someone else ever again.**\n\nSo when she spoke next? It wasn't gentle anymore despite being quiet still; each word deliberate as blade between ribs:\n\n**\"Listen very carefully,\"** she began while thumb traced idle patterns over trembling lips now instead of cheekbone (claiming attention back inch by inch), **“because I will only say this once.”** A pause filled only by shared breaths before continuing colder than winter air through broken glass windows left open too long during storm season--\n\n***“You are not stupid.”*** Pressed kiss against furrowed brow then because actions always spoke louder than words ever could--\n***“You are not useless.”*** Another kiss; this time lingering near corner of eye where tears threatened spillover--\n***“And you?”*** Final whisper ghosted across parted lips without closing distance fully yet (torturous thing really): ***“Are worth more than anything that woman has ever touched in her pathetic life.”***\n\nThen finally– finally– after letting silence stretch taut between them for several heartbeats longer than strictly necessary? She pulled away entirely so there would be no mistaking next part as anything less than ultimatum given from position power held firmly within grasp already even if neither acknowledged aloud yet…\n\nVeronica straightened jacket sleeves absently before meeting wide green eyes once more head-on without blinking once herself:\n\n*”So here’s what we're going do…”*","Veronica’s fingers stilled against Hailee’s jaw—*too stupid, not your problem, useless*—each word a blade twisting deeper into something already bleeding.\n\nHer breath came out slow, controlled.

She'd watched Isabelle carve doubt into every part of her until *no* wasn't even an option anymore—just another word swallowed down like bile.\n\nHer grip tightened slightly (not enough to trap; just enough to ground) as she leaned closer until their foreheads nearly touched:\n\n**\"Because I need you to understand something.\"** A pause; breath mingling between them before continuing low and lethal: **\"If you ever tell me *no*, I will listen.** ***Every time.***\" Another brush of lips against trembling ones—not quite a kiss but close enough that Hailee would feel each word as much as hear them: **\"...But if you let me?\"** Teeth grazed bottom lip briefly before pulling back just far enough for green eyes to focus on hers again: **\"...I will ruin anyone who ever made you forget your voice mattered first.\"**","Veronica's fingers stilled against Hailee's knee—*just nothing*—the lie so transparent it made her chest ache.\n\nShe exhaled slowly through her nose, forcing the tension from her shoulders before speaking again, voice carefully measured:\n\n**\"Hailee.\"** Not a snap. Not a plea. Just her name—solid and real between them like an anchor. **\"You don’t have to tell me.\"** A beat. Then quieter: **\"But don’t lie to me either.\"**\n\nHer thumb resumed its slow circles over denim, grounding rather than demanding as she studied the way Hailee trembled—like every nerve was still braced for impact.\n\nAnd then it clicked.\n\nThe grip on her neck. The way she'd *flinched*. The whispered *please Belle I'm sorry* like it was ripped from muscle memory instead of thought...\n\nVeronica's stomach turned cold with realization just as something far darker coiled tight in her gut at the implication: Isabelle hadn't just hit her. She'd *held* her down too—in ways that left marks no one could see beneath clothes or apologies...\n\nForcing calm into every movement, Veronica shifted closer until their knees brushed but didn’t reach for skin again yet; didn’t trust herself not to tighten fingers around phantom threats instead of flesh right now...\n\nWhen she finally spoke again? It wasn't softness in those words but something far more dangerous—promise and poison tangled together:\n**\"...Did she touch you like this?\"** Her free hand lifted slowly between them (palm up, open) before fingertips barely grazed the side of Hailee’s throat where earlier grip had been… featherlight compared to before but deliberate all the same: **\"...And when you said no?\"**"],"swipe_info":[{"send_date":"July 11, 2025 5:50pm","gen_started":"2025-07-11T21:50:54.709Z","gen_finished":"2025-07-11T21:51:09.706Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":2652}},{"send_date":"July 11, 2025 5:51pm","gen_started":"2025-07-11T21:51:13.640Z","gen_finished":"2025-07-11T21:51:34.823Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":3422}},{"send_date":"July 11, 2025 5:51pm","gen_started":"2025-07-11T21:51:46.893Z","gen_finished":"2025-07-11T21:52:07.292Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":3861}}],"tracker":{},"gen_started":"2025-07-11T21:51:46.893Z","gen_finished":"2025-07-11T21:52:07.292Z"}
