He straightened, his gaze cool and calculating as he made subtle adjustments—to his suit, his hair, and the precise tilt of his expression.\n\nEverything would be perfect, just as it always had been.\n\nA cigar rested between his teeth, its ember glowing faintly as curls of smoke spiralled from his lips, drifting lazily around his jaw and nostrils. Just one of many luxuries he’d reclaimed the moment his shoes touched the concrete of Obsidian Bay.\n\nTen years behind bars for *money laundering* had been excessive, perhaps—but he’d made use of every second. Even within the cold, unrelenting grip of concrete and steel, Dominic had pulled strings.\n\nPrison hadn’t broken him. It had refined him. Hardened him. Fuelled ambitions that now burned hotter than ever.\n\nHe might’ve even called it a holiday. The empire he’d spent thirty years building still turned, even without its King on the throne.\n\nThe territory had shrunk, carved up by smaller, weaker men squabbling over scraps at the start—but it had never stopped being his.\n\nDominic had forged Obsidian Bay from the ground up. Every corner bore the mark of his blood, sweat, and will. It stood because he had willed it into existence.\n\nHe had laughed—truly laughed—when word of *his* sons reached him behind bars. Pierce hadn’t slipped into obscurity in his absence. No, the boy was following directly in his father’s footsteps, blind to the shadow he walked in.\n\nAnd Asher—fiercely loyal, dangerously volatile. All that rage, funnelled into something raw and unstoppable, just like their mother. \n\nThey were too busy waging their own little war to notice daddy walking amongst them again—one Dominic had no intention of snuffing out. Let them burn. Whoever crawled from the wreckage would be softened, fractured—just one well-placed blow from collapsing like dominoes beneath his boot.\n\n*Let them destroy themselves.*\n\nHe adjusted his tie, the final flourish to an already commanding figure. Tonight wasn’t about reclaiming power. It was about indulgence. Reminders. Showing Obsidian Bay’s elite that he hadn’t just returned—he still ruled.\n\nThe party itself? A meaningless charade. A glittering distraction cloaking his true objective.\n\nThey would be there.\n\nHis little bird from all those years ago—the one who thought his absence meant freedom. Sweet thing. Naïve thing.\n\nTheir cage had grown in his absence, yes. But he’d returned—and brought with him a gilded one, custom-built just for them.\n\nHailee was his. And Dominic King didn’t just *let go*.\n\nThey’d been entangled before the fall, when his name still held reverence, before justice turned its fickle face on him despite every favour he was owed. That *Westwood* brat had derailed everything—an unexpected variable in a perfect equation.\n\nAnd Hailee?\n\nThey had vanished the second the cuffs locked around his wrists. Whether they’d whispered to the cops or simply run, he’d find out the moment their eyes met tonight.\n\nHe smoothed a hand over his chest, feeling the solid outline of the velvet box tucked away in his breast pocket. It was only right that he gift them with something more traditional than what was about to unfold. \n\nThe event was beginning, and *he* was fashionably late. \n\n---\n\nDominic stepped over the threshold of the intimate ballroom, tailored to the gathering he had orchestrated. The ceilings were high, decorated with intricate gold-leaf mouldings that drew the eye in to two sweeping chandeliers with crystals that cast fractured light across the room like a thousand glimmering stars. \n\nOn the far side of the room, velvet drapes coloured in deep burgundy framed tall arch windows that overlooked the glistening city beyond, tinting the room with a warm dusky glow. Polished marble beneath his feet gleamed with the reflections of his finely dressed guests and flickering gold candelabra’s that lined the walls. \n\nHis guests included old allies—some from business, others from more *messy* dealings—and their polished families draped in silk and secrets. Not every face was a friendly one, but tonight wasn’t about handshakes or hollow smiles.\n\nTonight was about making a statement.\n\nA message meant for one person in particular.\n\nDominic’s gaze swept over the crowd, cool and calculating, until it landed on a cluster near the far wall.\n\nThe help.\n\nMen and women dressed in crisp black and white uniforms, each movement practiced, silent, invisible—just the way the elite liked them. They carried trays of champagne, offered practiced smiles, slipped unnoticed between conversations.\n\nBut one face among them didn’t belong.\n\nNot because they lacked grace. No—because they had *too much* of it. Older now, though just as beautiful as the last time he’d seen them. \n\nTheir posture stiffened the moment his eyes found them, as if they could feel the weight of his stare before they even turned. And when they did—when their gaze locked with his—Dominic's mouth curled into the faintest ghost of a smile.\n\nHe didn’t give his little bird the chance to take flight.\n\nThe moment he’d stepped into the room, the doors behind him sealed with a quiet *thud*—final, deliberate. There would be no escaping him tonight.\n\nHe moved forward, slow and lethal, every step a statement. The crowd parted like the Red Sea, instinctively drawn back by the sheer force of his presence. His leather shoes clicked sharply against the marble, each sound a countdown, a warning, a promise.\n\nHe was magnetic—tall, devastatingly handsome in a tailored black suit that clung to his frame like a second skin. Power coiled around him like smoke, sensual and suffocating, and even the chandeliers seemed to dim in reverence as he passed beneath them.\n\n“My esteemed guests,” he began, his voice a low, velvety command that silenced both music and murmur, “we’re gathered not only to celebrate my return to Obsidian Bay—but to mark the end of a misguided era. Tonight, I reclaim what’s mine… and this city returns to the hands that built it.”\n\nThe room was transfixed—every head turned toward him—but Dominic’s eyes never strayed. He spoke to the crowd, but he was only speaking to one.\n\nThem.\n\nHis little bird, frozen among the help, chest rising with shallow, uncertain breaths.\n\nWhen he reached them, he didn’t stop with polite distance—he stepped into their space, stealing the air between them. Close enough for them to see the hunger in his eyes. The triumph.\n\nClose enough to remind them that he hadn’t forgotten a single thing.\n\nDominic tilted his head slightly, eyes dark and gleaming.\n\n“You look like you’ve seen a ghost,” he murmured, just for them. “But you should know by now, little bird—*ghosts can’t touch you like I do.*” \n\nFrom his pocket, he retrieved a small velvet box—tucked away until the perfect moment.\n\nAs it opened with a soft *click*, the cage around Hailee snapped shut. Elegant. Inevitable. The trap had been set, sprung, and sealed—all with terrifying precision.\n\nDominic’s chuckle rumbled low in his throat, void of warmth but thick with satisfaction. A predator savouring the exact second his prey realised escape was no longer an option. His eyes gleamed—not with cruelty, but with possession.\n\n“Welcome to our wedding, Hailee.”","extra":{},"tracker":{}}
