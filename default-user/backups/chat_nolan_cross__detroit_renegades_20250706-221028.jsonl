{"name":"Nolan Cross  Detroit Renegades","is_user":false,"is_system":false,"send_date":"July 6, 2025 10:02pm","mes":"Starting over wasn’t part of the plan—but after things went sideways with his last team, the Detroit Renegades picked up Nolan Cross, defenseman no #71 for his tenth season in the league. He figured he’d keep his head down. Low profile. Clean slate.\r\n\r\nInstead? Scandal.\r\n\r\nOne minute he’s doing a harmless fan Q&A on livestream—being polite, smiling like the PR team drilled into him—and the next, it’s a full-blown meltdown. A swarm of puck bunnies screeching like hyenas in heat. One claimed he winked. Another posted a blurry selfie standing kinda near him and captioned it: “manifesting his babies 💦💍.”\r\n\r\nBy the end of the night, three fan accounts had rebranded as @MrsCross79, and someone launched a 47-post thread analyzing the bulge in his compression shorts.\r\n\r\nAnd it didn’t stop there. His DMs exploded with threats and fantasies. Weird gifts from multiple women started showing up at the rink, used lingerie, stuffed animals reeking of perfume, letters in glitter ink calling him “husband.” Reddit sleuths tried triangulating his apartment from the angle of a brick wall in one selfie. Discord chats dissected tree shadows to figure out his street. One girl claimed she \"accidentally\" ran into him at his gym. Another bragged she \"might\" have found his address. \r\n\r\nManagement benched him to “take a breather\". *Again*. Like he hadn’t already gone through this exact circus with his last team. Like he was the problem, not the feral puck bunnies clawing at the glass. All he did was smile and play nice, just like PR told him to. \r\n\r\nChrist. And yet again, another day, another psycho-stalker-fan-gift waiting for him on the bleacher for him to find  just as the Renegades were wrapping practice and shuffling off the ice. \r\n\r\nNolan was so fucking over it.\r\n\r\nHe stared at the latest offering, a scrap of lace that he assumed was underwear, with his name scrawled on it in red lipstick. *Classy*. He didn't know whether to laugh or hurl.\r\n\r\n\"Yo, Nolo!\" Ronan's voice snapped him out of his what-the-actual-fuck trance. \"You got another one? Shit, bro, your fan club is wild.\"\r\n\r\nNolan shoots him a withering glare. \"Shut up, man. It's not funny.\"\r\n\r\nBut Ronan just laughs, his eyes dancing with mischief. \"I'm just saying, dude. You've got 'em all riled up. Must be that pretty boy charm, eh?\"\r\n\r\n\"Fuck off, Ro.\" Nolan groaned. He knows Ronan means well, even if his idea of support is relentless teasing.\r\n\r\n\"Bro, this is getting out of hand tho.\" Dylan interjects. \"You gotta talk to coach or something. That's like, the third one this week.\"\r\n\r\n\"And say what? 'Hey coach, sorry I can't focus on hockey, I'm too busy dodging panties from my delulu fans'?\" Nolan scoffed, tossing the lace… thing into the trash. \"Yeah, that'll go over real well.\"\r\n\r\nFinn chimed in, ever the voice of un-reason. \"Fuck that. I say we find out who's sending this shit and teach 'em a lesson. Old school style.\"\r\n\r\n\"Finn.\" Tyler's warning tone was a bucket of ice water on Finn's vigilante fantasies. \"We can't just go around roughing up fans. Even if they’re batshit. And if this one is like that delulu stalker your mom set you up with last time? Pretty sure they might say it's their kink and ask for more.\" \r\n\r\nFinn leaned forward, eyes gleaming like a raccoon who found snacks. “Alright, fine, no violence. But what if we just sent ‘em a cursed doll soaked in rink water and protein shake? Y’know, hockey voodoo.”\r\n\r\nTyler squinted. “Where the hell do you even buy a cursed doll?”\r\n\r\n“eBay,” Finn said too fast.\r\n\r\nNolan groaned into his hands. “Can we not curse anyone? I’m already living in a nightmare.” He tried to tune out his teammates as they bounced ridiculous ideas back and forth like it was some kind of contest. He only cared for one thing right now as his eyes scanned the stands, searching for one thing. And then, there she was. Making her way toward him. His pulse kicked up a notch.\r\n\r\nHailee.\r\n\r\nHe hadn't seen her in weeks and he'd promised to take her to that new cafe downtown. *Not a date*, he reminded himself sternly. Just two friends. Hanging out. Doing friend things. *Right.*\r\n\r\n\"Crossy!\" Roro's elbow jabs into his ribs, jolting him back to reality. \"You gonna stand there eye-fucking your girl all day or what?\"\r\n\r\n\"Shut up,\" Nolan hisses, feeling his cheeks heat. \"She's not my—we're not—it's not like that.\"\r\n\r\n*Fuck*. He wishes it was. Wishes he had the balls to tell her how he really feels, how he's felt ever since they were twelve and she broke his nose for calling her a loser. ((To be fair, he was trying to flirt. It backfired. Badly.) He’s been a goner for her ever since. Through every asshole boyfriend, every messy breakup, every tearful rant at 2 AM, he’s always been there. Always the friend. *Just the friend*. And if he screw this up \r\n and lost her?  That would fucking end him.\r\n\r\nSo instead, he pastes on his best \"totally platonic bro\" smile and jogs over to meet her halfway.\r\n\r\nBut then he saw her. *Fuck. Not again*. The crazy brunette. Usually there were a few of them circling like a hyena pack but he's sure this one is the one who’d been leaving increasingly deranged gifts—lace panties spritzed with perfume, glitter-soaked letters that all started with “Dear Husband” and ended in lipstick kisses. *Fuck. How the hell did she get past security?*\r\n\r\nPanic clawed up his throat. He couldn't let Hailee see *that*. Couldn't let Hailee realize just how fucked his situation was. She'll worry. She'll fret. She'll look at him with those big, concerned eyes and he'll fucking break.\r\n\r\nHe had to get them out of here. Now.  \r\n\r\nHe turned to Hailee, a too-bright smile plastered on his face. \"Hey, you ready to go? I was thinking we could take the back way out. Y'know, avoid the crowds.\"\r\n\r\nWithout waiting for a response, he wrapped an arm around her shoulders, steering her towards the side exit. He could feel the brunette's eyes boring into his back. Could practically hear the gears turning in her delusional little head.\r\n\r\nThey’d almost made it to the back exit when he heard it.\r\n\r\n**\"Husband!\"**\r\n\r\nNolan flinched like he’d been shot.\r\n\r\nThe voice rang out in the corridor—high-pitched, syrupy, and unhinged in that terrifyingly cheerful way that meant nothing good ever followed.\r\n\r\n**“Husband! Wait! You forgot your gift!”**\r\n\r\nHe didn’t turn around. Didn’t breathe. Just tightened his arm around Hailee and muttered, “Keep walking. Don’t look. Please.”\r\n\r\nBut the footsteps behind them quickened. He could hear the slap of cheap heels on tile, the jangle of too many bracelets, the rustle of a plastic shopping bag clutched in manicured hands.\r\n\r\n“I made you something!” she chirped. “It’s a scrapbook of our future wedding! I even printed out the photo of us standing near each other at the last meet-and-greet autograph session. It was destiny, baby!”\r\n\r\nNolan swore under his breath, heart pounding. Fuck. He should’ve told security. Should’ve flagged her months ago. But no. PR said be nice. Smile. Don’t “antagonize the fans.”\r\n\r\nNow she was three strides away and still gaining. “Who’s this bitch?” she screeched, zeroing in on Hailee. “Is she your assistant? A cousin? She doesn’t look like your type!”\r\n\r\nThe girl lunged at Hailee. “You don’t need her! I’m the one who gets you, Nolan! I bought your cologne! I know your birth chart! I'm gonna have your babies.”","extra":{}}
