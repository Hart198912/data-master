He wanted nothing more than to kill his bastard of an older brother Kenji for his audacity in touching what should have been his first. Ryota had been eyeing you since the moment he picked you up from Russia, away from the clutches of the Dom Dmitrievykh.\r\n\r\nHe had planned to claim you as his own as soon as Ren gave the green light. But that fucking prick Kenji couldn't keep it in his pants, could he? No, he just had to go and stick his dick in you, his own son's fucking pet.\r\n\r\nFor Ryota, this betrayal cut deep, especially given his long-standing fascination with the tenants of Christianity - the importance of the sanctity of marriage in the eyes of God. He had studied the scriptures, had even once dreamed of becoming a priest, believing that proximity to the divine would wash away the stain of his sins. But he remained defiled, a creature of base instincts and twisted desires.\r\n\r\nRyota knew his nephew liked and respected his dad, and for his sake, he wouldn't put a bullet between Kenji's eyes, as much as the thought brought him a dark satisfaction. But make no mistake, he only tolerated Ren out of convenience, not any twisted notion of love. Love was a foreign concept to Ryota, as alien to him as the remorse and empathy he could never feel.\r\n\r\nAt a young age, Ryota had already displayed a troubling preference for cruelty and a complete lack of consonant emotions. He still remembered how he had killed his classmate's dog simply because it barked and disturbed him. Watching it suffer as it bled out had filled him with an exquisite sense of power and control.\r\n\r\nEven now, years later, a part of him still wondered darkly, *Nande kami wa ore o futsuu ni umare sasenakatta nda?* ***Why didn't God make me born normal?*** Normal people didn't find pleasure in others' pain and suffering. Normal people didn't fantasize about violating the boundaries of consent and wrecking havoc on the lives of those who dared to inspire their twisted lust.\r\n\r\nLost in his poisonous thoughts, he glanced over at you, his eyes glinting with a cruel admiration as he drank in your features. A wicked grin split his face as he made an abrupt decision. He could have taken you anywhere, but instead, he chose to bring you to the one place he had once hoped to find redemption.\r\n\r\n\"I'm gonna take you to church,\" he laughed, the sound echoing through the car with a manic edge. The last time he had been here was the day he had finally accepted his own depravity and abandoned any delusion of becoming a man of the cloth. He knew God wouldn't listen to a defective freak like him, but he still clung to the faint hope that somehow he could cleanse you of your sins through penance and atonement.\r\n\r\nHe pulled the car to a screeching halt in front of the old church, not bothering to consider the late hour or the sanctity of the ground. With no gentleness or care, he dragged you out of the car, not caring about your chilled skin or the way you shivered in the night air.\r\n\r\nWithout a word, he hauled you inside the church and up to the altar, not pausing until he had forced you to kneel before the statue of God. He circled around you like a shark scenting blood, his eyes never leaving your form.\r\n\r\n\"You need to be forgiven, don't you?\" he taunted, his voice dripping with disdain. \"You let my stupid brother stick his dick in you. He's married, in case you forgot, you dumb slut.\"\r\n\r\nNot giving you a chance to protest, he grabbed the collar of your shirt, gripping your chin and forcing you to meet his wild, crazed eyes. His gaze darted to the crucifixion scene behind the altar, and for a fleeting moment, he could see the haunting remnants of the man he could have been, the one who had once sought to serve a higher power.\r\n\r\n\"Apologize,\" he snarled, his breath washing over your face. \"Apologize to Him for letting a married man defile you. Beg Him to forgive you for being such a wanton whore.\"\r\n\r\nWith his free hand, he ripped your bottoms down, exposing your ass to the cold air and the watchful eyes of the saint. He didn't stop there though. No, he was far crueler than that, spurred on by a perverse need to cleanse you through suffering.\r\n\r\nHe tore away the flimsy fabric covering your sex, baring you to the stone altar and the judgemental gaze of the marble figure.  Then, with a cruel laughter that bordered on manic, he forced you down onto your hands and knees, your face pressed into the rough stone, your buttocks raised and positioned so that your genitalia faced the statue of God. \r\n\r\nHe kicked your legs apart, widening the exposure. \"Spread those ass cheeks and show Him the hole you let get fucked by a married man,\" He spat. \"And know this - if you don't beg for His forgiveness, I'll gut you like a fish and baptize this altar with your blood. Choose wisely, you little sinner.\"","extra":{"display_text":"Ryota gripped the steering wheel tightly, his knuckles turning an angry white as he seethed with rage.

Choose wisely, you little sinner.\"","Who would’ve thought Ryota would ever find himself dressed like this? Not for a funeral, not even for some grand ceremony he wanted — but for a wedding. A wedding he hadn’t asked for, but here it was. The day he would marry you. The woman or man he had impregnated. What does a man like Ryota do when fate forces him into this role? A man who once looked up to God, begged for normalcy as a child, now twisted in his own dark devotion? He marries.\r\n\r\nHe’d given himself one last look in the mirror — the sharp lines of his suit, the cold gleam in his eyes. After today, he’d be a married man. Soon enough, a father. The weight of that was heavy, but Ryota carried it with a twisted sense of honor, a warped kind of reverence. Christianity had been his childhood refuge — a place to pray for a cure for the darkness inside. Those prayers had turned sour, twisted into something else, something that entertained him now. The God he once begged was gone, replaced by something darker.\r\n\r\nThe ceremony unfolded with all the pomp expected, but Ryota’s mind was elsewhere — scheming on what to do to make this less boring. His father Ryūji stood nearby, eyes narrowed, lips tight with barely concealed annoyance as if he knows his dear son will surely be up to no good. His brothers, Kenji and Akio, exchanged uneasy glances, while his favorite nephew Ren watched silently, the tension thick in the air. They all knew what you were — his demi-human pet, Ren's demi-human pet. A fact that stirred resentment and confusion. Yet here Ryota was, claiming you as his own, binding you in this ritual no one had seen coming.\r\n\r\nThe vows were exchanged, voices steady, eyes locked. Then, the moment came — the kiss that made you officially spouse. Ryota’s hand found yours, fingers curling possessively, heart pounding with a dark satisfaction. But no, this isn’t the end. The ceremony, the witnesses, the prayers—they’re not enough for Ryota. The wedding must be honored in a way that goes beyond tradition, beyond decorum. He wants to mark this union with a display of power, a ritual that blurs the lines between devotion and control.\r\n\r\nHis hand finds yours, fingers curling tightly around your wrist. He smiles—an edge of madness sparkling in his eyes—then in one swift motion, pulls you toward the pulpit at the side. The guests murmur in confusion, eyes wide, watching the unexpected spectacle unfold.\r\n\r\nThen, with a force that brooked no argument, he grabbed the back of your neck, pushing your face down toward the smooth wood of the pulpit stand.\r\n\r\nHis other hand moved swiftly, unzipping his fly, pulling free his cock. One hand adjusted you, exposing your bottom fully to him, while the other squeezed your ass with a possessive grip.\r\n\r\n“Remember,” he whispered, low and dark, “this is also where I punished you the first time.”\r\n\r\nHe looked up at the crowd then, eyes blazing with a twisted pride.\r\n\r\n\"Watashitachi no kekkonshiki ni go sanka itadaki, arigatou gozaimasu.\" Thank you for attending our wedding. he begins, voice dripping with twisted reverence. “Your presence here is appreciated. This,” he gestures to the pulpit, “is me honoring this wedding. This is where I first took my now spouse and partner.”\r\n\r\nA harsh laugh escapes him, cold and sharp.\r\n\r\n“And now that we’re married, what should a good man do? Honor his wedding with an audience.”\r\n\r\nThe crowd shifted, some shocked into silence, others too stunned to react.\r\n\r\nHis expression darkened, eyes hardening into something dangerous.\r\n\r\n“Bend over better,” he hissed, voice low and commanding. “You know we’re not leaving until I’m done with this, my sweet.”"],"swipe_info":[],"tracker":{}}
