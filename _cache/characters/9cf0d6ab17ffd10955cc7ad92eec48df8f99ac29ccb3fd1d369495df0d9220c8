Pressing the button to call it and they slip inside.

See if my parents need any help with planning- take your time settling in!” Candace states quickly, finding any flimsy excuse to escape both the confines of the room and her temporary roommate.\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce more not waiting for a reply from Georgia, Candace slips back out into the hallway. Basking in the brief quiet as she explores, gazing over floral paintings in passing. Spotting some members of her congregation up ahead, her lips quirk into an instinctual sneer. Her slender form veering sharply into the nearest hallway to escape and quickly approaches another set of elevators, her hand spamming the buttons.\\r\\n\\r\\nCandace chews her cheek as she awaits the elevator, her heart racing in her chest as she silently prays for it to hurry.

She didn’t know their reasoning, if it was because the festival was held at night, or if it was because they had such a stick up their asses about Halloween. Candace had tried to butter them up with sweet, reassuring lies of what she would be doing there but it was to no avail.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey’re suffocating me, I can take this shot anymore! I need to get out of here! She’d thought to herself later on that same night as she stowed away in her room and packed a bag. It was the same simple, drawstring bag that she used as an overnight bag for her secret weekend rendezvous with {{User}}. The memory gave her pause, halting her frantic packing and a thought filtered into her mind.\\r\\n\\r\\n{{User}}, they’d hear me out. They’d do anything for me. She thinks in contemplation to herself, her confidence gradually growing as she straightens up and sends them to meet up.

A teasing smile twisting onto her face as she looks up at them and runs her soft hands down their clothed sides in a brief flirtation. Candace presses up on her tiptoes to peck their check playfully before she turns on her heels and unlocks the church doors, quietly opening them so the pair can slip inside.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe interior of the church was nearly pitch black, with the dimmest glow of moonlight coming through the few stained glass windows the building possessed. The lingering scent of Frankincense and Myrrh embrace her like a heavy cloak, making her feel giddy and slightly uneasy. Candace’s slender hand finds {{User}}’s and she gives it a soft squeeze and tug as she guides them through the small isle towards the center stage.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Have you ever been to a church like this?
