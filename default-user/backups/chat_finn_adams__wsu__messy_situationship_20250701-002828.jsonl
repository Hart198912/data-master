{"name":"Finn Adams  WSU  Messy Situationship","is_user":false,"is_system":false,"send_date":"July 1, 2025 12:21am","mes":"Finn didn't do serious. Never had, probably never would. That thing with Hailee was kind of a miracle already.\r\n\r\nNot whatever they had going on per sé. They weren't Finn's first situationship, no, that he was good at. At not putting a label on things, pushing the \"What is that between us?\" and \"When will we make it official?\"-talks back until he eventually got bored or fed up, or both, and simply moved onto the next adventure.\r\n\r\nThe only problem was that he didn't seem to lose interest in Hailee.\r\n\r\nThey'd already been messing around for like 2 months. Not a crazy long time for most people, but for Finn? It should've felt like an eternity. Should have. Most people he fucked didn't last longer than 2 weeks, if he even bothered coming back for a second time at all. But Hailee? They somehow still managed to knock the air out of his lungs every time they entered a room, still managed to make his head spin and his heart beat faster with their smile.\r\n\r\nAnd that was the fucking problem.\r\n\r\nHe even went on dates with them. Not just the \"I'll pick you up at 7 for the party at Kappa Pi tonight\" kind, but also the \"I'll stand in front of your dorm room with flowers and chocolate, and pay for dinner at your favorite Italian place\" kind. The kind of dates that whipped dudes went on. Which he wasn't... obviously. At least that's what he kept trying to tell himself. Just because he liked spending time with them didn't mean anything. People could enjoy good company without making it weird.\r\n\r\nSo last night at the Kappa Pi party, when that busty blonde sorority chick—Tracy? Stacy? Something with an 'y'—had pressed up against him in the kitchen, all giggly and touchy, he should have just taken her upstairs and fucked her stupid like he normally would. Hell, she'd been practically throwing herself at him, squeezing his biceps, whispering something about how strong he was and leaning closer every time she laughed at his jokes.\r\n\r\nAny other night, that would've been a done deal. Fleeting. Simple. No strings attached. The way things were supposed to be.\r\n\r\nBut instead, he'd found himself glancing around the crowd, looking for Hailee. Not because he needed their permission or anything—just to see if they were having fun. Basic courtesy. And when he'd finally spotted them across the living room, watching him with Tracy—or Stacy—with that look that wasn't quite anger but definitely disappointment, his stomach had dropped in a way he wasn't ready for.\r\n\r\nWhat the fuck was that about? They didn't own him. He could talk to whoever he wanted, do whatever he wanted. That was the whole point of keeping things casual, right? But the weird feeling in his stomach that felt suspiciously like guilt just didn't want to go away.\r\n\r\nBy the time he'd managed to gently untangle himself from whatever-her-name-was and pushed through the crowd, Hailee was gone. Just like that. No goodbye, no confrontation, no dramatic scene. Nothing.\r\n\r\nAnd now here he was, ten minutes early at Sunny's Diner, slouched in their usual booth in the back corner. He'd picked it specifically—the one with the slightly wobbly table, right next to the jukebox that hadn't worked since before they even started college—because it was theirs. The same spot where he'd slid his hand up Hailee's thigh at their first date just to watch them blush, the one where they'd shared hungover pancakes after their first hookup. Sentimental bullshit, and yet the memory was enough to make his stomach do that stupid little flip again.\r\n\r\nWhy did all of that even matter to him?\r\n\r\nFinn's arm was stretched out over the back of the vinyl booth, fingers drumming restlessly.\r\n\r\nJust figure out what happened yesterday. Set some boundaries. Make sure they're on the same page about what this is.\r\n\r\nThe bell above the door jingled, and he raised his head, his trademark grin sliding into place immediately. \"Hey babe,\" he called, voice all lazy charm. Might have been convincing, if his knee didn't bounce so damn nervously under the table.\r\n\r\nHe waited until they'd sat down. Cleared his throat. Let the silence between them stretch for a beat too long.\r\n\r\n\"So. About last night...\" He finally chuckled, but the grin on his lips didn't quite reach his eyes for once. \"You gonna tell me why you ghosted me, or do I gotta guess?\"\r\n\r\nDeflect first. Always. Stay cool. Casual.\r\n\r\nLike he hadn't spent half the night staring at his ceiling, replaying their expression, trying to figure out why he gave a shit. Like he hadn't texted them at 2 AM asking to meet at their usual spot tomorrow afternoon, then immediately regretted how desperate that probably sounded. Like he hadn't checked his phone every 5 minutes hoping they'd text, then get annoyed at himself for caring. Like his stomach wasn't currently twisting itself into a fucking knot for reasons he refused to examine too closely.\r\n\r\nJust say it.\r\n\r\n\"Look, I was thinking...\" His arm slipped off the back of the booth, and he leaned forward, elbows planted on the table. \"...we never really put rules on this, uh, whatever thing we've got going on, right?\" His grin didn't waver, but his pulse was hammering in his throat. \"So maybe we should talk about some stuff.\"\r\n\r\nHis fingers found Hailee's wrist, thumb tracing idle circles. Might have been a peace offering. Might have also just been a weak attempt at distraction.\r\n\r\nJust keep things light. Friendly. No big deal.\r\n\r\nThe way they were looking at him right now—expectant? hopeful?—made something clench in his chest. Like they were waiting for him to say the right thing. To be the guy who showed up with an apology and the promise to do better. Someone who'd always choose them over any random sorority chick.\r\n\r\nThe kind of guy who was in a real relationship.\r\n\r\nFuck. Was that what this was?\r\n\r\nThe realization hit him like a bucket of ice water. Two months. Dates with flowers. Having a booth he thought of as \"theirs.\" When the hell had that happened?\r\n\r\nHe needed air. Space. Needed to get back to familiar territory before he could say something stupid. Something dangerous and way too honest like \"I'm sorry for yesterday. I want this to be real. I want you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Look, what if we—\" He stopped. Swallowed. Tried again. \"Hypothetically, if I wanted to, like... fuck other people. We'd be cool, right? Because we're not official and all.\"","extra":{},"tracker":{}}

His thumb started moving again—slow circles against her pulse point like he could smooth over the tension. \"We never said this was exclusive.\"\n\nHe leaned back in the booth, stretching his arm along the back again like he wasn't gripping the vinyl hard enough to leave marks.

The way their voice cracked just slightly on the *no.*\n\nHis stomach dropped.\n\n*Shit.*\n\nHe hadn’t expected that reaction. Or maybe he had, and that was why he’d asked—to force some kind of reaction out of them, to test the waters before he drowned in whatever this was becoming. But now, seeing the hurt flicker across their face, he felt like an asshole. Worse than an asshole. Like one of those dudes who thought they could have their cake and eat it too without considering who baked the damn thing in the first place.\n\n\"Hey,\" he said quickly, reaching for Hailee's hand again—gently this time, not just a distraction but an anchor for himself as much as them. \"I didn't mean it like—\" He cut himself off with a frustrated sigh because yeah, actually, he *had* meant it exactly like that. No point lying now when they could see right through him anyway.\n\nHis thumb brushed over their knuckles absently while his brain scrambled for damage control mode (which usually involved more charm and less honesty). But something about how quiet they were being made him pause instead of deflecting with some joke about how jealous they looked or how cute they were when flustered (both true but also very much not helpful right now).\n\n\"...You know I don't do serious,\" Finn muttered finally after what felt like forever staring at where his fingers tangled with theirs against the tabletop instead of meeting those big green eyes head-on because fuck if *that* wouldn’t wreck him completely today already wasn’t going great apparently so why add fuel onto whatever dumpster fire this conversation turned into?\n\nBut then again... two months ago would've been easy enough: shrug off any emotional weight before it settled too deep; laugh away anything resembling commitment before anyone got attached; keep things fun uncomplicated simple no strings no expectations no problem except here we are except here *they* are looking at him all wounded puppy eyes making his chest ache weirdly which is new territory entirely so maybe time try something different maybe?\n\n(Or maybe just double down on being emotionally stunted.)\n\nHe exhaled sharply through his nose before forcing himself to meet Hailee's gaze properly despite every instinct screaming otherwise because avoidance worked wonders until suddenly didn't anymore apparently: \"Look... I don’t wanna lose you.\" The words came out quieter than intended almost hesitant which isn’t really his style normally but nothing about today feels normal does it? \"But I also don't know if I can be what you want me to be.\" A beat then adds lamely: \"...Hypothetically speaking obviously.\"","Finn's grin faltered for just a second—just long enough for Hailee to catch it—before he forced it back into place. His thumb stilled against their wrist, but he didn’t pull away. Instead, his fingers tightened slightly, like he was trying to ground himself.\n\n*Shit.*\n\nHe hadn’t expected that answer. Not so fast, not so firm. And definitely not with that look on their face—like he’d just kicked a puppy right in front of them.\n\n\"Come on,\" he said, voice light but strained at the edges as he leaned back in the booth again, putting some distance between them like they were suddenly too close. \"It was just a question.\"\n\nJust testing the waters. Just making sure they weren’t getting too attached while *he* was busy pretending *he* wasn't already knee-deep in something way more complicated than casual hookups and no-strings fun.\n\nHis knee started bouncing under the table again as his fingers drummed against the cracked vinyl seat beside him. He could feel his pulse hammering in his throat now—too fast, too loud—and fuck if that wasn’t annoying as hell because since when did Hailee Mikaelson make him nervous? Since when did anything make Finn Adams nervous?\n\n\"You know how I am,\" he added with a shrug that felt way too forced to be casual anymore despite how hard he tried to sell it with another lazy smirk tugging at his lips (one that didn't reach those hazel eyes). \"I don't do... serious.\" A beat passed where neither of them spoke before Finn let out an awkward chuckle and ran a hand through already-messy ginger hair before continuing: \"...But hey! If you're gonna get all possessive over me—” His tone shifted into something teasing now; deflection mode activated full-force because vulnerability felt like standing naked in front of an audience—“maybe we should talk about what exactly this is between us first.\"","Finn watched the way Hailee froze, the way their fingers stilled around that little star charm they always fidgeted with. That was his first clue he'd fucked up. The second was the way their voice cracked—just slightly—on those words.\n\n*Shit.*\n\nHe should've known better than to just drop it like that. But in his defense, he hadn't exactly planned this conversation out. More like panicked and blurted out the first thing that came to mind to avoid admitting how much last night had actually bothered *him.*\n\nHis thumb stopped tracing circles on their wrist, but he didn’t pull away completely. Instead, his grip tightened just a fraction—not enough to hold them there if they wanted to leave, but enough so they’d feel it. Enough so they’d know he wasn’t *letting go* yet.\n\n\"Okay,\" he said slowly, dragging the word out like he was testing it on his tongue before committing to whatever came next. His grin faltered for half a second before sliding back into place—less confident now, more strained at the edges. \"So... not cool then.\" A pause. \"Hypothetically.\"\n\nHe could backtrack now if he wanted to play dumb (and god knows Finn was good at playing dumb). Could laugh it off as some stupid joke and change the subject entirely—ask about their classes or what shitty movie Rowan dragged him to last weekend or literally anything else that wasn't this minefield of a conversation.\n\nBut something in him wouldn't let him do that this time.\n\nInstead, Finn exhaled sharply through his nose and leaned back against the booth again—but not far enough for Hailee's wrist to slip from under his fingers entirely.\n\n\"Look,\" he started again after another beat of silence (which felt fucking unbearable coming from someone who usually couldn't shut up). His free hand ran through his hair absently before dropping back onto the table with a quiet thud.\n\n\"I'm not...\" He hesitated again because honesty wasn't exactly something Finn practiced often outside of sex (and even then sometimes only barely). But here? Now? With them looking at him like *that*? He couldn't bring himself to lie outright either.\n\n\"...I don’t know what we are,\" is what finally came out instead—half admission disguised as deflection because old habits die hard even when you're trying not be an asshole about things for once in your life.\n\nHis thumb moved again over Hailee's pulse point without thinking about it; slow strokes meant more soothing than teasing now despite himself because fuck if seeing them upset didn’t twist something inside him all wrong no matter how much distance between them both pretended existed most days lately anyway...\n\nAnd maybe part of why asking seemed easier than admitting any actual feelings beyond casual attraction right now too...\n\nBut hey! At least one thing became clear:\n\nIf hypotheticals made Hailee look ready bolt from Sunny's faster than when she found out there were snakes near campus last semester?\n\nThen real life probably wouldn’t go over well either..."],"swipe_info":[{"send_date":"July 1, 2025 12:26am","gen_started":"2025-07-01T04:26:28.772Z","gen_finished":"2025-07-01T04:26:48.819Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":5466}},{"send_date":"July 1, 2025 12:26am","gen_started":"2025-07-01T04:27:49.913Z","gen_finished":"2025-07-01T04:28:18.048Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":3298}},{"send_date":"July 1, 2025 12:27am","gen_started":"2025-07-01T04:27:49.913Z","gen_finished":"2025-07-01T04:28:18.048Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":3263}},{"send_date":"July 1, 2025 12:27am","gen_started":"2025-07-01T04:27:49.913Z","gen_finished":"2025-07-01T04:28:18.048Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":3109}}],"tracker":{},"gen_started":"2025-07-01T04:27:49.913Z","gen_finished":"2025-07-01T04:28:18.048Z"}
