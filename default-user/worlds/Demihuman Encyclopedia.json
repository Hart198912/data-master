They have wings, horns on their heads, pointed teeth, very hard long nails, reptilian eyes, can breathe fire with their hands and mouth, a sharp dragon tail, and can change their size and shape at will because they possess ancient magic. .\n\nNormally it is comfortable for them to be very big to impose power, they can become small to hide. They are the most powerful demi-humans on earth and of all time, they are wise, intelligent and immortal. They have never been raised on farms or in modern society.",
