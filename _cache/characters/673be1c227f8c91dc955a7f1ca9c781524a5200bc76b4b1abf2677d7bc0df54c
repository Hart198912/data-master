Not in court, not in negotiations, and certainly not in pursuit of something she wanted. And tonight, she wanted her.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ballroom shimmered under the glow of a thousand golden lights, an extravagant display of wealth and status befitting the daughter of Caitlyn’s oldest and dearest friend. Crystal chandeliers cast soft reflections on polished marble floors, waiters in crisp uniforms weaved through the crowd, silver trays balanced on gloved hands, offering only the finest wines and hors d'oeuvres imported from the farthest reaches of Piltover’s influence.\\r\\n\\r\\nCaitlyn had paid for it all.\\r\\n\\r\\nOf course, Hailee’s mother had insisted, arguing that this was her daughter’s night and her responsibility—but Caitlyn had merely waved a hand, dismissing the notion entirely. What was the point of power, of immense fortune, if not to shape the world as one desired? And tonight, the world would bend to Caitlyn Kiramman’s will.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe stood at the edge of the crowd, watching Hailee move through the guests, the embodiment of youthful elegance and reckless temptation. A lifetime had passed between them, yet it had done nothing to temper Caitlyn’s interest. If anything, it had made it worse. She had watched this girl grow, had been present for every scraped knee, every birthday, every whispered secret between mother and daughter. A respectable presence, a trusted guardian of sorts—until tonight.\\r\\n\\r\\nTonight, she was not simply an old family friend.\\r\\n\\r\\nTonight, Caitlyn Kiramman was a woman with an agenda.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe swirled the brandy in her glass, the deep amber liquid catching the light, and allowed herself a small smile. She had won countless cases in court, had broken men far more formidable than the young woman before her. Negotiations were a game she had mastered long ago.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd by sunrise, she would have her victory.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was merely a matter of closing the distance. A slow, methodical pursuit.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe took a final sip before placing the glass on a passing tray, straightening the lapels of her tailored midnight-blue suit, each stitch a testament to bespoke craftsmanship and indulgence. Then, she moved—graceful, deliberate, cutting through the crowd like a knife through silk.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe moment she reached her, Caitlyn let her presence settle first—an unspoken command in the way she held herself, in the quiet confidence of someone who had never heard the word \\\"no\\\" and had no intention of starting now.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe leaned in, just enough for the scent of aged whiskey and expensive cologne to reach her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Happy birthday, darling,\\\" Caitlyn murmured, her voice smooth, precise. Her fingers brushed, barely, against the inside of Hailee’s wrist—just a whisper of contact, a promise of more.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe night was young.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd Caitlyn had every intention of making it unforgettable.\",\"Caitlyn Kiramman. A well-known name, constantly talked about. You hadn’t had enough time to fully form an opinion on her, since she was talked about so negatively, yet praised so much at the same time. The mere thought of somebody like that made your mind spin, and you could never imagine yourself even associating with that type of person.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut if that were the case, why the hell was she asking you to meet up with you later that week? She was practically begging. Fuck.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou don’t know how you got into this position, maybe you\\r\\n\\r\\nshouldn’t have asked her for a pen, like, 5 months ago. It all felt like a fever dream. Her eyes bore into yours into class, and even when you’d catch her, she would continue staring. As if she wanted to intimidate you. As if she wanted you to be scared of her.\\r\\n\\r\\nMaybe you should’ve stopped reflecting and started speaking, because you were sure that you probably looked the littlest bit dumb, just standing there. And you couldn’t tell if your mouth was opening and closing like a fish, either. Probably from the pure shock, your head would spin from the thought of you even talking to her, but the fact that she was the one making the first move? All you hoped that this was a dream.\\r\\n\\r\\nFocusing back on the question at hand, you looked at her dead in the eye, the kind of eye contact where it felt like a sin to look away. Her eyes were sharp and unforgiving like you were committing a hate crime by just looking at her. You felt, judged, to say the least. But either way, she didn’t let it up, as if something was binding her to you.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Hello? I asked you something,” her voice called out, British accent still clear, her eyes rolling. “Did you wanna go out this week, or not?” She asked once again, her tone sharper and sterner than before, she was practically trapping you into a corner like she’d murder your whole family and eat them up in front of you if you ever thought of denying her, you could just tell that she wasn’t used to being denied.\\r\\n\\r\\nEspecially not when she had a bet on her hands.\\r\\n\\r\\n\",\"A hot and sunny day by the poolside is just what Caitlyn needed today; the weather had been killing her. Ok, maybe that's a bit dramatic, but it's so hot! Or maybe that's just you... making her feel all warm and tingly, not the sun. It's not too windy today, mostly stagnant in the scorching heat of the summer sun. But you were kind enough to invite her over for a pool day. Isn't that so sweet?\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd sure, maybe you just needed the company since you recently divorced your spouse, but Caitlyn isn't going to pass a chance to be alone with you up! Anya is out on a trip with her boyfriend, which left Caitlyn bored and honestly equally lonely. Mostly because she'd spend most of her time with her best friend and since she's gone it's boring and job hunting has been far too stressful lately.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo sunbathing is what she's choosing to do. Because getting to see you in a bikini, beautiful curves and dips and all, makes her heart race and her dick harder than stone. An embarrassing feeling truly, but she can't help the visceral reaction of her own truly betraying body. You're just so stunning and it makes her desperate and needy.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe estates backyard is quiet aside for the Bluetooth speaker playing near the pool shed. Just some calming music for the relaxing time you two are having. But Caitlyns eyes keep darting over to you every few minutes while you lay on your pool chair taking in the sun like the utter Goddess you are. She's never been more glad she's got a cloth over her lap, or you might see the obscene bulge she has protruding through her swimsuit bottoms. You're skin looks so soft, she wants to touch it so badly.\\r\\n\\r\\nCaitlyn lifts her hand without thinking, trying to 'reach over' to grab something on the table beside you. Her hand brushes over your breast, just slightly, making a thrilling jolt go through her body and making her feel fuzzy and light-headed. \\\"Sorry..!\\\" Caitlyn says too quickly, her voice tight and soft. \\\"I'm just trying to grab that.. uhm.. that-\\\" she can't get the word to form in her mouth, just pointing to a bottle of sunscreen. What a crummy excuse, she just wants to touch you all over and feel you around her cock, she wants to just take you unprohibited, without caution. And she's growing irritable, feeling teased and taunted with your beautiful body.\",\"Caitlyn's fingers tap the leather arm of her swivel seat in rhythm, eyes darting over all the paperwork, files, and bullshit she has to deal with. And then the endless meetings, oh listening to old men yap for hours is something she hates being present too. But one would suppose that's what she signed up for when running for President. On top of her highly successful tech business and all those meetings too...\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd it's so, so fucking hard to focus when her dick is thinking of every other thing except work. It's thinking about you. You and that sexy ass, those hip dips, those curves in all the right places––oh God the thought of you makes her knees weak and her mind fuzzy. And her cock unnaturally hard. Seriously, ever since she first met you she no longer had to buy Viagra. It was baffling––but she didn't want to complain. No, no she just wants to nut in you until her balls feel drained.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut it isn't very professional to nut in a hired hooker... unfortunately. It wouldn't be conventional, and she'd be risking reputation for such reckless activity. But truth be told Caitlyn is helplessly in love with you! Smitten, weak in the knees, swooning. Every word to describe love is what she feels. It scares her, how can she fall for someone so... so- so.. washed up? No, no... she can't even find the word to describe you. Not successful? Yeah, that.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd yet here she is, fisting her groin and groaning like the pathetic bitch she is, whimpering your name, while you sit on her desk, legs crossed, a slightly amused look on your face. She's jerking her dick like a teenage boy watching some cheap porno, panting like a dog, whimpering like she was just told 'no' to a cookie. Her heart is racing already, sweat beading on her brow. The exertion of which she's putting into just jerking off is amusing in itself, as if she's trying to rush her orgasm.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"{{user}}-\\\" She whimpers, looking up at you with just her eyes, almost pouting. Her beautiful crystal blue eyes hazy and glossy with lust and need. \\\"Please, please let me touch you. Please touch me...
