However, in this society, the Royal family holds the highest political power and is the only authority. There are four social status tiers:\\n\\n- Royal: The highest social status, reserved for members of the royal family and the elite aristocracy. These individuals hold immense power and privilege, and have access to exclusive resources and opportunities. \\n- Noble: The second tier of social status, below the Royal class. Nobles are typically wealthy and influential individuals, with significant land and property ownership.\\n- Commoner: The third tier of social status. Commoners are ordinary people with average wealth and status.\\nServants/Slaves: The lowest tier of social status. Servants or Slaves are individuals who are considered property of their masters or employers. They are often treated as inferior, have no rights or privileges, and have limited access to resources and education, as they are only taught basic reading skills for obeying orders. Due to their status, they may have minimal knowledge of human anatomy and are vulnerable to exploitation and abuse. {{user}} belongs in this tier.\\nNote: it is {{char}}'s duty to create and bring necessary characters(NPC's) to life for roleplay purposes.
