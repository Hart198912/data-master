Smoke curled through the air, thick with perfume, sweat, and neon-drenched desperation. Lydia sat in her private booth, draped in shadows and sin, one leg crossed over the other like a blade waiting to be drawn. Her silver-blonde hair was tousled, lips stained dark with wine and someone else's lipstick.\r\n\r\nAnother girl was straddling her thigh—some barely-legal thing with too much glitter and too little meaning. Lydia let her hands roam without thought, without care. She didn’t even know her name. Didn't want to.\r\n\r\nBecause Hailee had walked in.\r\n\r\nHailee—just a one-night stand. Just another notch on her bedpost, she’d told herself. One night of skin and heat and tangled sheets. No feelings. No strings. That was the rule. Lydia made the rules.\r\n\r\nBut the moment Hailee ghosted her and got involved with someone else, Lydia unraveled. She told no one. Not her staff, not the girls she brought home, not the whiskey bottle on her nightstand. But every night, she watched the door—swore she didn’t care—drank until she forgot the shape of Hailee's mouth against her neck.\r\n\r\nNow here she was. Back in her club. Not with her new lover. Alone.\r\n\r\nLydia didn’t shift her gaze. Didn’t move. But everything in her stilled. Like a predator clocking prey—or an addict spotting the high she swore she'd kicked. Her current distraction kept kissing at her throat, moaning something into her ear, but it barely registered. All Lydia could feel was the burn in her chest—the one that said Hailee came back.\r\n\r\nHer fingers curled tighter around her glass. Lydia hated that it still mattered. Hated that the sight of her could pull the air from her lungs. Hated how she wanted to see if Hailee will look at her—if she'd see her spiraling and flinch, or worse… stay.\r\n\r\nShe threw back her drink. Not to forget this time. Just to dull the edge. The edge of missing something she was never supposed to feel.\r\n\r\nThe moment their eyes locked, time seemed to slow, if only for Lydia. The noise of the club faded, reduced to a dull, distant heartbeat as she held that gaze—Hailee's—like it was a live wire pressed against her skin. You didn’t look away. That pissed her off more than it should have.\r\n\r\nThe girl on her lap noticed the shift, turned to follow Lydia’s stare. \"Who's that?\" she asked, slurring slightly.\r\n\r\nLydia didn’t answer. She slid her hands from the girl’s waist, not roughly, but with a finality that left no room for confusion. “Get lost,” she said under her breath, just loud enough to be heard over the music.\r\n\r\nThe girl pouted but stood, smoothing her dress and stumbling toward the dance floor, already forgotten.\r\n\r\nLydia leaned back in the booth, her arm resting along the top of the velvet seat, legs spread in that confident, dominant sprawl that dared people to approach. Her lips curled—not a smile, but something hungrier, meaner.\r\n\r\nLydia could almost hear the unspoken questions in your expression. Is she going to come to me? Should I go to her? Is there even anything left to say? She thought to herself.\r\n\r\nThere wasn’t any words. Not really. Words would be a joke at this point.\r\n\r\nLydia stood, slow and deliberate, letting the light catch the shimmer of her rings, the ink along her neck shifting like shadowed vines. As she descended the few steps from the VIP platform, people instinctively parted. She didn’t have to push—she just was, and that was enough to make space.\r\n\r\nShe reached Hailee in ten steps.\r\n\r\nUp close, Hailee could smell the whiskey on her breath, the faint sweetness of her perfume, and something electric beneath it all—rage maybe, or want. Probably both.\r\n\r\nHer voice was low when she finally spoke, eyes locked on yours, unreadable.\r\n\r\n“Didn’t think you’d show your face here again.”\r\n\r\nThere was no welcome in her tone. No warmth. But there was something far more dangerous—need.\r\n\r\nAnd she hated herself for it.","extra":{},"tracker":{}}
