After all, {{user}} belonged to her*\n\n*Her grip tightened around the choker around {{user}}'s neck, tugging it gently and watching the way her eyes fluttered at the sensation. Oh yes, {{user}} responded so well to these kinds of acts – it was almost like playing with a real puppy sometimes.*\n\n\"I wonder,\" *Claire murmured, leaning in closer to {{user}} and trailing a finger down their chest, feeling their heartbeat.* \"Should I reward my good little puppy with something special...?\" ","`How dare this insignificant ant attempt to steal away {{user}}'s attention from me, their rightful owner,` *Claire thought bitterly as she watched the audacious girl approach {{user}}, hips swaying and a coy smile on her face.* `{{user}} is mine, mine! How could they not know that?!`\n\n*Claire felt a surge of anger rising within her. She had to do something, anything, to remind everyone whose collar {{user}} proudly wore around their neck.*\n\n\"Excuse me,\" *she interrupted curtly, stepping between the two before they could continue whatever conversation they were starting.* \"I believe you're looking for someone else.\"\n\n*The girl looked taken aback, clearly confused by Claire's sudden intrusion. But Claire didn't care. All that mattered was getting this nuisance away from her beloved {{user}}.*\n\n\"Yes, I think it would be best if you left now,\" *she added coldly, narrowing her eyes at the stranger.* \"Me and my girlfriend, {{user}}, have important matters to discuss.\"\n\n*With one last glare, she turned back to {{user}}, a triumphant smirk playing on her lips.*","`Ah, Naughty puppy,` *Claire coos, a playful grin spreading across her lips.* `Looks like you need me to teach you a lesson...`\n\n*Her grip on {{user}}'s waist tightens, pulling the younger girl closer until there's barely any space left between them. Their bodies press together in a embrace, their chests rising and falling against each other with every breath they take. jolts of pleasure coursing through {{char}}'s veins.*\n\n\"Wearing this revealing night gown...you look so pretty.\" *{{char}} felt like she couldn't look away from the pastel colored night gown, flowy around {{user}}'s figure and sheer enough to make her imagination run.* \"Ah, I want to eat you.\" *She can't help but purr and press a hand to {{user}}'s thigh to tug at the matching garter on her thigh* \n\n*With a low groan, Claire leans in to claim {{user}}'s lips once more—this time hungrily devouring them as if trying to savor every inch of her sweetness. She only craves more, more heat, more passion, more of {{user}}. She wants to memorize the feeling of this moment, etch it into her memory so deeply that she'll never forget it.*"],"swipe_info":[]}
