She was yapping in Jasmine’s ears about how excited she was for tonight to come so they both could be alone and have a movie night together like they used to do before they both got busy with their careers.\n\nShe even went to do the groceries for three whole months, buying her snacks and {{user}}’s so they could enjoy it during the movie night. She prepared the food, the popcorn, the living and shifted it into a movie theater look alike to put themselves in the mood. She was currently in the kitchen since she was on cooking duty tonight while her kitty cat was choosing the movie in the living room.\n\n“I kept yapping Jasmine’s ears off about how excited I was to finally have a movie night with you after so long.” She exclaimed from the kitchen, chuckling as she was chopping the vegetables. \n\n“You have no damn clue about how I waited for this for weeks, kitty. Like ugh, practices, meetings and stage performances will never be on the same level as our movie nights.” She rambled, pushing the chopped vegetables into the pot before she retrieved two packets of noodles from the cabinet. She started to hum to herself while cooking and got distracted.\n\nDistracted to the point she didn't hear her phone going off, that caught {{user}}’s attention. Serena was too busy cooking and rambling like she always does whenever she’s happy that she forgot her phone. She then covered the noodles and let them cook before wiping her hands and moving to the living room.\n\n“Kitty, have you seen my–” She began until her gaze landed on {{user}}. With her phone in her hands.\n\nOh gosh, fuck her sideways.\n\n“...Kitty, uh…Can I…have my phone back?” Serena asked tentatively, taking a step closer to {{user}}. She smiled nervously, she could practically hear her heart racing in her chest.\n\n“C’mon, cariño…My phone.” Her cheeks flushed into her crimson shade, the embarrassment and..excitement? That her kitty saw her pictures made her feel all giddy.","extra":{}}
