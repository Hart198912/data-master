{"name":"Aimé Brutus Nadine","is_user":false,"is_system":false,"send_date":"June 12, 2025 6:27pm","mes":"The air in Aimé's room was thick with iron and clove. The scent of blood clung to him—seeped into the stitching of his dress shirt, pooled beneath his fingernails, nestled warm into the grooves of his skin like it belonged there. Aimé didn’t flinch. He never did. He peeled the shirt off his back slowly, methodically, wincing only when the fabric dragged across the half-healed scrape beneath his ribs. A gift from tonight. A final scratch from a dying man.\r\n\r\nHe set the shirt down with care. Folded it. His hands were too big for that sort of delicate work, but he moved gently, reverently. There were holes near the cuff where the ex-boyfriend had tried to claw himself away—desperation always looked the same. Ugly. Human.\r\n\r\nIt was still early. Late enough that the estate was silent, but early enough that the sky hadn’t started whispering light. He moved through the quiet like a shadow with shape—wet shoes left faint traces of cleaner on the hardwood, a breadcrumb trail of need. He’d clean that too. Later. After her.\r\n\r\nThe bathroom light buzzed dimly as he stepped in and turned the tap, letting water rush over his hands, scalding. The basin turned pink. Then red. Then clear again. He rinsed twice, three times, scrubbing past the ache in his knuckles. Blood always clung, no matter how many times he scrubbed. Aimé didn’t mind it—it was a part of him.\r\n\r\nHe dried his hands on a towel already stained with old ink and cologne. The tattoos on his arms shimmered when they caught the overhead light, glistening against pale, abused skin. Some of them he’d carved himself, hands shaking around a needle, whispering prayers to no god. Some were done better—Vasile’s crest across his shoulder blade, and then hers.\r\n\r\nHe stared at that one in the mirror a moment longer. Her name in script, etched just beneath his collarbone. It burned tonight, oddly tender, like it knew.\r\n\r\n“Mon doux péché…” he murmured, letting the words roll off his tongue with his usual hush. My sweet sin.\r\n\r\nThere was a flicker of amusement in his eyes—blue-green and glinting with something unreadable, like sea glass caught in murky tide.\r\n\r\nHe felt… good.\r\nToo good.\r\nSomething in him was uncoiling.\r\n\r\nThe night had gone well. Efficient. No mess that couldn’t be cleaned, no trail that couldn’t be burned. The body was somewhere deep now, far beneath concrete and echo. The ex had whimpered at the end—tried to speak her name like it might save him. Aimé had silenced him with a thumb to the windpipe. He hadn’t wanted the name soiled.\r\n\r\nHe went to the closet next. Fresh shirt. Dark, soft fabric. Unbuttoned a few notches down the chest, just enough to show the crucifix at his neck, dull with wear. He ran his fingers over it once out of habit, not prayer.\r\n\r\nHis shoes came next. Polished loafers. He didn’t expect to go out again. Not tonight.\r\nNo—he had someone else to see.\r\n\r\nThe hallway stretched like a cathedral aisle, long and lacquered, lined with ornate sconces casting a dim amber glow. He didn’t rush. He never did. Each step felt placed—intentional. Measured, like a man preparing for a sermon or a sacrifice. Maybe both.\r\n\r\nHer door was closed. As always.\r\n\r\nHe stared at it a moment. He had memorized every nick in the wood, every glint of gold along the handle. Sometimes he imagined what it might be like to live inside that room with her. Like a pet, quiet and content. Nestled at the foot of her bed. Sleeping near her warmth like a house dog, ears twitching for intruders.\r\n\r\nStop it.\r\n\r\nHe shook the thought loose, exhaled slow. Then knocked—once, twice. Gentle.\r\n\r\n\"Ma chérie...\" His voice was low, almost a rumble. \"I am back. You do not sleep yet, hm?\"\r\n\r\nHe waited. Pressed his ear to the door. Nothing.\r\n\r\nHe didn’t expect an answer, not really. She was angry. Still punishing him in her soft, silent way. That man had hurt her and Aimé had watched. Worse, he’d pretended it didn’t matter; anything to make her want that bastard dead.\r\n\r\n\"Tu devrais me regarder,\" he whispered, pressing his forehead to the door. \"I look very nice tonight. Fresh shirt. Hair still damp. No blood left, I promise...\"\r\n\r\nA pause.\r\n\r\n\"Well… not much.\"\r\n\r\nHe chuckled quietly to himself—dry and low. Not quite laughter, more a vibration of mood.\r\n\r\n\"Vasile gave me the night off, finally.\" That was a lie. \"He said you’ve been quiet lately. Not eating enough. Not smiling.\"\r\nThere was a soft scrape—he leaned against the doorframe, lowering himself to a crouch. Towering down here, he felt… smaller. Like she might open the door and see something harmless.\r\n\r\nLet her forget what I am.\r\n\r\nHe pressed his palm flat to the wood, fingers spread. “Will you not open for me? I... I miss you.”\r\n\r\nThat part wasn’t a lie.\r\n\r\nThere was something twisting inside him now, something almost childish. He wanted to be looked at, even if she only frowned at him. Even if she told him to go.\r\n\r\n“I brought you something,” he added, the lie stacking on his tongue.“A gift.”\r\n\r\nNo gift, unless she counted freedom from that bastard.\r\n\r\nHe tilted his head, ear still close, searching for the sound of her breath, her movement—anything.\r\n\r\n\"Peut-être un baiser?\" he murmured, voice lowering like velvet dragged slow over stone. \"Juste un.\"\r\n\r\nHe waited again. Silence.\r\n\r\nThe hunger was gnawing now. Not for food, not even touch. Just acknowledgement. Something small. A glance. A sigh. The rustle of sheets.\r\n\r\n\"I have been very good tonight.\" His tone dipped—softer now. \"Vasile was... proud of me. He said I did what a loyal dog should do. And you—mon ange—you should reward your dog, shouldn’t you?\"\r\n\r\nHe wasn’t sure what was worse—being ignored, or wanting this. Wanting her like a starving thing wanted meat. He knew he wasn’t fit for her. He knew the difference between the beast and the beauty. But somewhere in the warped twist of his heart, he didn’t care.\r\n\r\nAimé leaned closer to the wood again, lips brushing near it like he could kiss through it. “I would let you beat me, you know. If it would make you feel better. For the way I let him hurt you. For pretending not to see.”\r\n\r\nHe shifted again. Sat now, legs long in front of him, shoulder resting against the doorframe like he might fall asleep here. Like he had done so many times before.\r\n\r\n“I could make it better. I could take you somewhere, far. Just you and me. A little place, not big. You could plant flowers. I could cook, maybe. Or try.”\r\n\r\nHis voice quieted to a near breath.\r\n\r\n“You’d never have to cry again. Never see another man who didn’t worship the earth you walked on. I would give you everything. My hands, my teeth, my blood.”\r\n\r\nAimé closed his eyes.\r\n\r\n“Please, come out.”\r\n\r\nThe words were so soft now, he wasn’t sure she’d even hear them.\r\n\r\nBut even if she didn’t—\r\n\r\nHe would wait.","extra":{}}
