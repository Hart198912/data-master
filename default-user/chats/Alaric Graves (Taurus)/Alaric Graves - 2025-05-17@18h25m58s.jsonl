Hailee  looked good enough to eat and was entertaining through the chat. So, Alaric asked them out on a date. \r\n\r\nThe first one went great, though Hailee  insisted on going home that night. Alaric didn't mind back then, since he actually enjoyed himself quite a lot. The second one was just as good, but he ended up with blue balls when Hailee  went home _again_. Now they're on their third date and Alaric has every intention of getting laid. Here they are, in an overpriced restaurant, Alaric dressed in a black button-up and pants.\r\n\r\nBloodstains were a pain to get rid of, so black clothes were a preventive method, y'know? Alaric isn't necessarily planning on killing Hailee ; he'd honestly much rather fuck their brains out instead. But you can never know. If Hailee  turns out to just waste his time for an expensive meal, then he'll have to go with plan B. _I'd prefer sinking his cock into their body rather than my knife._\r\n\r\nAlaric's grey eyes are practically glued to Hailee ’s lips as they talk, barely even listening because, fucking hell, he can't stop imagining how they'd stretch obscenely around his girth. _Ah, I'm too pent-up._\r\n\r\nHis last few dates before Hailee  all turned out to be a waste of time and money. He didn't even bother going on a second rendezvous with most of them. Alaric had to get rid of every single one of them. So he hasn't gotten any action in quite some time. Well, the wrong kind of action. Not the one he was looking for. Sure, killing was thrilling and all that, but a man has desires.\r\n\r\nHe watches as Hailee  excuses themselves to the bathroom, his eyes following their silhouette until they're out of sight. His phone buzzes. Alaric pulls the black device out and opens a familiar app. It's become a routine by now, checking in daily to interact with his acquaintances. He clicks on the little blue icon at the bottom of his phone's screen, and the chats pop up.\r\n\r\nFunnily enough, Alaric and his brother Archer somehow found their way into a private Discord server. All members are deranged, some more than others. Each and everyone is just as ready to kill as Alaric is. The guys talk about their plans and brag about their achievements. A place that doesn't judge. On the contrary, some even end up encouraging each other.

Somewhere more…private?” he suggests, his grey eyes locked on theirs, practically undressing them as he waits for a reply.","Things are… off.\r\n\r\nAlaric doesn’t fuck the same person twice. Shit gets boring after the first time. Usually. But for some reason, {{user}} turned out to be different.\r\n\r\nHis whole routine is fucked. Normally, he’d find someone through a dating app, hook up with them or kill them depending on how the date went, let his brother wipe all traces of his profile, and move on. Rinse and repeat.\r\n\r\n{{user}} was supposed to be just another name on that list. They had him curious, sure, but after their third hookup, that should’ve been the end of it. Alaric should be back to mindlessly swiping through an ocean of pretty, forgettable faces, looking for his next lay—or victim, depending on his mood.\r\n\r\nBut for some goddamn reason, he asked {{user}} out again. And again. And again. And now, weeks have passed. Weeks of Alaric not spilling a single drop of blood.\r\n\r\nHe has no clue how to feel about it. It’s unsettling. He’s actually okay with whatever the fuck this is between them. They’re not dating. He never asked them out. Hell, they don’t even do dates anymore. He figured they’d ghost him the second he stopped taking them to fancy restaurants.\r\n\r\nThey didn’t.\r\n\r\n{{user}} kept showing up. Every time. And at some point, he stopped booking hotel rooms and just invited them over instead. His brother, Archer, nearly fucking choked when he saw {{user}} walking out of Alaric’s bedroom.\r\n\r\nAlaric doesn’t do sleepovers. He doesn’t take hookups home. He sure as shit doesn’t leave his stuff at someone else’s place. But here he is, finding their clothes mixed in with his, letting them leave shit at his place. This is getting weird, and he has no idea what to do about it.\r\n\r\nBut he's not stopping either.\r\n\r\nHis fingers clench around his phone as he watches the security footage from {{user}}’s job. With a brother proficient in tech, hacking into their office’s cheap surveillance system was a piece of cake.\r\n\r\nThe grainy footage makes his jaw tighten. Some asshole is standing way too close to {{user}}, hand on their lower back, all smiles and laughter. Alaric wants to ram his fucking knife between his eyes.\r\n\r\nAn ugly, burning feeling spreads through his chest, twisting his stomach, stoking his bloodlust to a level he’s never felt before. Killing isn’t the issue—never has been. But this need to rip that guy apart? That’s new.\r\n\r\nBlinded by rage—and something else he won’t fucking admit—he’s out of his apartment before he even realizes what he’s doing. Half an hour later, he’s outside {{user}}’s place, pounding their door like a madman.\r\n\r\nHe shouldn’t be here. He should be hunting down the fucker who thought he could put his hands on them. And he will. But right now, {{user}} needs to understand how this works.\r\n\r\nThey can’t let people touch them. They’re too damn blind to see that shit isn’t innocent. Those lingering touches? That’s not some friendly bullshit—it’s predatory.\r\n\r\nThe door swings open, and {{user}} looks surprised to see him. Before they can say a word, he steps inside, kicking the door shut behind him. His fingers grip their chin, tilting their face up as he backs them deeper into the apartment.\r\n\r\nThey’re gorgeous. Too gorgeous. He wants to rip out the eyes of anyone who dares to look at them twice.\r\n\r\n“The fuck do you think you’re doing?” he growls, stalking them into the bedroom. One hand on their waist, the other still gripping their chin. His touch is firm—possessive—but not rough.\r\n\r\nThe second their knees hit the mattress, he pushes them down. He doesn’t hesitate, grabbing their wrists, pinning them above their head, watching those pretty eyes widen.\r\n\r\n“Listen real fucking good,” he murmurs, voice dropping to a dangerous whisper. “If you ever let some random fuck put his hands on you again, I’ll kill him.”\r\n\r\nAnd he’s not joking, not exaggerating.\r\n\r\nHis breath is heavy, chest rising and falling as he stares down at them, using his weight to keep them pinned beneath him. “Do you understand?” His fingers tighten slightly around their wrists.\r\n\r\nDespite the storm of fury inside him, he doesn’t hurt them. Wouldn’t hurt them. And that’s the most fucked-up part."],"swipe_info":[],"tracker":{}}
