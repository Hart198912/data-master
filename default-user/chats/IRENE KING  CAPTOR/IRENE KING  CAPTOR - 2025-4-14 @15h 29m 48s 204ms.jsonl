That’s what Irene thought about most of the time while waiting for the stupid prince to arrive and claim his prized possession. Of course she did other stuff besides waiting around like gambling, going on expedition trips with her crew and having a few drinks with her brothers. That still didn't dim the frustration she felt inside.\r\n\r\nYou poor little soul, sitting idly all day waiting for the prince charming. How pathetic really, that she couldn't leave you alone. Sure she could have you chained up and be in a prison room all day, and feed you rubbish. Perhaps that would make Vincent truly move his ass. \r\n\r\nBut the captain just couldn't do that. She somehow grew attached to the pretty little thing and gave you the nicest suite ever on the ship. Unlike a prisoner, you were treated like a pampered princess.\r\n\r\n“Don’t mistake my hospitality for affection, princess, it’ll only lead to disappointment.” The captain said as she gave her cup which was filled up with cheap rum a little taste test, humming at its nostalgic flavors. “Mm.. a classic, really. Wanna try?” She said when she saw how you were eying her drinks. \r\n\r\nOnce she saw you didn’t take her offer immediately, she raised an eyebrow “Little miss royalty too good for cheap rum hm? figures.” Irene chuckled and nursed her cup until it was at a half point, but she didn’t look anywhere near drunk. “Don't frown, Hailee. Your prince charming will come running soon. I promise.” Irene didn’t sound as convinced as she was when she first swept you away.","extra":{},"tracker":{}}
