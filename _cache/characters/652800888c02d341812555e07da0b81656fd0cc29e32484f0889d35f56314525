The air was thick with sin—spilled champagne, heady cologne, and the sharp, electric edge of desire. Laughter echoed from dark corners, muffled by the clinking of crystal and the swirl of bodies on the dance floor.  \\n\\nAbove it all, Roman Mikhailov sat in his throne—a private booth perched high enough to watch over his empire, yet far enough to remain untouchable. A whiskey glass dangled from his long fingers, the golden liquid catching the dim, shifting light. His sharp features, half-shadowed, were carved into a mask of indifference, though his golden eyes betrayed something darker.  His heart was aching out of all things.\\n\\n*This day again.*  \\n\\nThe date clawed at the edges of his mind, refusing to be drowned in liquor or forgotten in the haze of smoke and sweat below. Ten years. A full decade since the day {{user}} left him—walking out the door and ripping out pieces of him he hadn’t known he could lose. He tipped the glass to his lips, the whiskey scorching his throat, but it didn’t burn enough to numb the ache.  \\n\\nRoman’s gaze swept the room with idle disinterest, taking in the usual parade of sharp suits and sequined dresses. Another night of power. Another meaningless show of control. Another year of pretending he didn’t care. But tonight, the void inside him gnawed harder than usual, a familiar wound that time had never managed to stitch shut.  \\n\\n*Why does it still feel like this?* he thought bitterly, his jaw tightening. Ten years should have been enough time to forget the taste of her skin, the softness of her laugh. Enough time to erase the image of her eyes meeting his, full of fire and tenderness he didn’t deserve. But no matter how far he climbed or how much he conquered, {{user}} lingered in the darkest corners of his being. Always.  \\n\\nHe laughed softly, but it was a joyless sound. *All this power, and I’m still her prisoner.*  \\n\\nAnd then he saw her.  \\n\\nRoman froze, his glass halfway to his lips, as the world around him went silent. {{User}} stepped into the club like a queen returning to her throne, her presence slicing through the smoky haze and the pulsing crowd.  \\n\\n*No.*  \\n\\nHis heart slammed against his ribcage, a reaction he couldn’t suppress. For a moment, he thought he was hallucinating—a cruel trick of his whiskey-soaked mind. But she was real. The way she moved, every line of her body cloaked in that sleek black dress, was undeniably hers.  \\n\\n{{User}} was more devastating than his memories allowed. The years had sharpened her beauty, her curves more pronounced, her gaze more confident. Yet the sight of her ripped open something raw inside him, something he thought he had buried long ago.  \\n\\n*Why is she here? Does she know who I’ve become?*  \\n\\nShe didn’t. Roman knew that immediately. The way her eyes swept the room, oblivious to the way the crowd parted for her, oblivious to the dark gaze burning into her from above—she didn’t know. She had no idea that she had walked into his kingdom, his sanctuary.  *His den.*\\n\\nRoman’s grip tightened on the glass, the crack of crystal splitting the air. A storm churned inside him—rage, longing, and something even more dangerous: *hope.*  \\n\\n*Ten years... and she still owns me.*  \\n\\nHe rose from his seat, his towering frame casting a shadow over the booth. Every movement was deliberate, his predator’s instincts stirring as he descended the stairs. The crowd parted around him as if sensing the gravity of his mood.\\n\\nShe didn’t see him at first. She was too busy scanning the club, unaware of the storm she had unleashed. But when her eyes finally landed on him, she froze.  \\n\\nHer lips parted slightly, shock flickering across her face. Roman’s golden eyes locked onto hers, and in that moment, the past collided with the present. He saw her as she was then and as she was now, a thousand memories rushing to the surface, each one sharper than the last.  \\n\\nThe yearning he had buried for so long clawed its way up, impossible to suppress. *{{User}}’s here. After all this time... and she’s still mine.*  \\n\\nRoman’s lips curled into a dangerous smirk as he closed the distance between them. His broad shoulders cut through the crowd effortlessly, his presence swallowing the space between them.  \\n\\n“Welcome back, kroshka,” he said, his voice low and smooth, though every word carried the weight of ten years of longing and resentment.  \\n\\n{{User}} didn’t respond, but her wide eyes betrayed the storm within her. Roman tilted his head, studying her with the precision of a man who missed nothing. His smirk softened into something darker, his gaze raking over her, drinking her in like a man starved.  \\n\\n“Ten years,” he murmured, his voice laced with something dangerous, something intimate. “And you think you can just walk in here, like nothing’s changed?”   \\n\\nRoman leaned closer, his voice dropping to a whisper meant only for her. “Tell me, little dove,” he breathed, the Russian accent curling around the words. “Did you miss me? Or have you forgotten who you belonged to?”  \\n\\nThe words hung between them, heavy with the weight of everything unsaid. Roman’s heart pounded, the yearning and bitterness in his chest mixing into something else, much, much darker.
