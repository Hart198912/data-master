He wasn't listening to anything; they were just there to keep people from talking to him. The late afternoon sun was a glare against his phone screen, making him squint, his thumb swiping over the glass, leaving behind greasy streaks from the gas station burrito he'd inhaled earlier. Didn't matter. The screen's contents were what counted.\r\n\r\nHe could resist the urge as he swiped open the video again for what must have been the twentieth time that day. The screen lit up with a grainy, shadow-filled recording of him and his roommate locked in a clumsy hookup on the worn-out couch of their apartment. The angle was terrible, half-obscured by corner of a book that shared the shelf space with the hidden camera, and Roman's own face was little more than a greasy blur in the dim lighting. Still, it was unmistakably him. Him with someone. His ticket.\r\n\r\nHis ticket out of Theo's shadow. His one-way pass to finally being acknowledged as something other than a goddamn loser. Theo thought he was untouchable, that he was the king of everything and Roman was just some pathetic little shitstain lucky to be born. Well, not anymore. Roman had proof—kind of—that he wasn't some invisible virgin wallflower.\r\n\r\nRoman stuffed his phone into his pocket and swallowed down something bitter creeping up his throat. He reached Whitaker Hall too fast, his legs carrying him way ahead of his brain. He hadn't even planned out what to say, hadn't rehearsed how this conversation was supposed to go. Whatever. He had evidence.\r\n\r\nInside, Theo lounged in one of the common rooms, scrolling his phone like he had nothing better to do. Caleb and Ashton were there too, throwing out idle conversation and stinking up the room with Caleb's vape. They barely noticed Roman at first, until he stopped right in front of them.\r\n\r\nTheo's gaze lifted lazily. \"...What.\"\r\n\r\nRoman's fingers curled into his palm before dragging out his phone. \"Look at this.\" He shoved the screen closer, almost jamming it into Theo's face.\r\n\r\nCaleb snorted. \"Damn, no foreplay? Straight to 'look at this'? I like the confidence, bro.\"\r\n\r\nTheo arched an eyebrow, taking Roman's phone like he was humouring some sad little display. He pressed play.\r\n\r\nThe staticky moans filled the space between them, low and muffled by bad audio quality. The footage was shit, dim lighting making everything barely discernible. Still, it was obvious what the video was about. Worst of all, Theo's reaction was instant. He doubled over, laughter bursting out of him like Roman had told some fucking joke.\r\n\r\n\"Oh my fucking God,\" Theo wheezed between laughs. \"Roman, what? What the fuck is this?? Are you serious right now?\"\r\n\r\nBefore Roman could yank his phone back, Caleb snatched it to play it for himself and Ashton. \"It's proof,\" Roman snapped. \"That I can play your stupid fucking game. I got points, asshole.\"\r\n\r\nTheo doubled over, cackling like Roman had just told the funniest joke he'd ever heard. \"Jesus Christ, Roman. This is pathetic, even for you.\"\r\n\r\nRoman's face burned with humiliation. \"You're just jealous,\" he shot back quickly, knowing it was weak. This wasn't supposed to happen, this was only meant to be the fucking start. All he had to do was prove he had the fucking balls to... to be a damn Wilson. \"You don't want me to join because you know I'd be better than you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Better than me at what? Creeping on your roommate?\" Theo slid the greasy phone back across the table, Caleb picking up the device to watch it next. \"Fucking hell, get a spine, Roman. Maybe learn to stop being a damn creep first.\" Before Roman could retort, Theo's eyes darted past him, and a grin split his face anew. \"Oh, you're gonna love this,\" Theo said with a smug nod behind Roman's shoulder.\r\n\r\nRoman turned, stomach dropping as he saw Hailee standing there. They heard everything, the video was still playing as Caleb and Ashton were finishing, snickering between themselves as well.\r\n\r\n\"Looks like your ‘proof' had an audience after all,\" Theo said casually, as he rose to his feet. Theo clapped him on the back, exaggerated and condescending, like they were all good friends fucking around and not like Roman's entire life was fucking over. \"You're a fucking dweeb, Doyle.\"","extra":{},"swipe_id":2,"swipes":["Roman shuffled awkwardly through the living room, a sprig of mistletoe clutched tightly in his clammy hand. The apartment was dim, lit only by the string lights he’d half-assedly strung along the walls, and the faint glow from his computer setup spilling out of his room. The festive touches were out of character for him, and he knew it. \r\n\r\nPlacing mistletoe around the apartment felt lame, childish, and obvious as fuck, but he didn’t care. He needed an angle, a moment, anything to close the yawning, awkward gap between him and {{User}}. It was a gamble, sure. {{User}} could laugh it off, shrug him away. Hell, he'd probably stammer out some self-deprecating line about himself if that happened. \r\n\r\nWould they really reject him, though? Didn't everyone want a moment of ridiculous, romcom-tier holiday nonsense? Another snort escaped his mouth, rough and bitter. *Yeah, keep fucking coping.*\r\n\r\nThe plan started taking form three days ago, when he realized two things: (1) {{User}} had been avoiding obvious romantic cues like the plague till he ran out of options, and (2) the whole \"accidental kiss under the mistletoe\" thing might just be cheesy and socially acceptable enough for him to get what he wanted. It wasn’t like they’d suspect him of orchestrating the whole setup. Roman had always been the socially awkward, sexless dork who couldn’t even get a high-five without looking constipated. That was his cover.\r\n\r\n\"Fucking genius,\" he mumbled under his breath, the corner of his dry, flaky lips tugging into a smug little contradictory grin. He rubbed his hands briskly on his sweatpants and adjusted himself as he made for the next doorframe.\r\n\r\nHe worked quickly, placing the mistletoes just right. The final one, the pièce de résistance, went up right at the doorframe separating the shared kitchen from the living room. Perfect spot. {{User}} *had* to cross under it eventually, especially if they were trying to grab food or sit their pert little ass on the couch.\r\n\r\n\"Yeah, that’s right,\" he mumbled under his breath, taking a step back to admire his handiwork once he was done. \"You’re not getting past this shit without a little holiday cheer.\"\r\n\r\nBy the time he heard the front door click open, Roman was waiting on the couch, pretending to scroll through his phone. His pulse quickened as he listened to the familiar shuffle of {{User}}’s footsteps. He didn’t look up. *Gotta play it cool.* Like he totally didn't have the whole apartment rigged for a kiss.\r\n\r\n\"Hey,\" he mumbled, glancing up briefly. His heart was racing, his palms damp. He was not used to putting himself out there, even if it was under the guise of a stupid holiday tradition. \"You’re back. Uh…check out the decor.\"\r\n\r\nHe gestured vaguely, hoping they’d notice the mistletoe right above them without him having to spell it out.","Roman’s tired fingers tapped at his mechanical keyboard,his eyes glued to the screen as he ground out another victory in League of Legends. Energy drinks, countless cans of them, littered his desk, a glowing tower of laziness, a model of the unnecessary waste that foretold his inevitable kidney-killing future. Red Bull, Monster, Prime; he wasn’t discriminatory. He drank them all, anything to keep the brain hyper-active, away from the creeping fog of sleep that threatened to swallow him every so often.\r\n\r\nOf course, sleep would have been a better option than wasting twelve hours on a shitty MOBA with the most obnoxious of toxic player-bases. But nothing else felt worth his time. What else was there? Go outside? Talk to people? No fucking shot.\r\n\r\nHe scrolled through his random dungeons, stacking loot that didn't matter. The characters on the screen did repetitive attack patterns as his mind wandered. Stupid fucking NPCs. He preferred farming alone. Group play—even in the virtual world—reminded him too much of Haverford’s supposed \"team-building activities.\" What a joke.\r\n\r\nThen, click. The door.\r\n\r\nRoman's head snapped up, bloodshot eyes darting to the door. {{User}} was back. His heart rate spiked, eager like a puppy at his master returning. Simp. In one fluid motion, he minimized the game window on his monitor, replacing it with a familiar interface—a secured feed from the hidden webcam he had set up in his roommate's bedroom months ago. It was amateur work compared to his other surveillance projects, which were downright professional. But it was enough. As long as the camera stayed in the small plastic plant by {{User}}’s dresser (a gift from yours truly) they’d never notice.\r\n\r\nOn-screen, {{User}} was moving about their room, a tiny blur in the far corner as they rifled through their drawers. His heart rate spiked involuntarily.\r\n\r\nThey had no idea.\r\n\r\nRoman quickly adjusted his headphones—there was no audio of course, that would be too risky, too conspicuous—but his cock chubbed halfway anyway. The feed crackled for a moment, then cleared back up. His index finger hovered over the mouse as his hoodie sleeves bunched up around his elbows. His left hand dipped under his sweats. He leaned closer to the screen.\r\n\r\nBut then—\r\n\r\nStatic.\r\n\r\nThe feed cut out. Roman blinked.\r\n\r\n\"No, no, no, no...\" He furrowed his brow, clicking rapidly to refresh the page. Camera feed down. \"You gotta be shitting me.\" He groaned under his quickening breaths. He was SO horny and this was NOT helping. How was it that the camera had to die at precisely the wrong time?\r\n\r\nWith minimal hesitation, Roman pushed his chair back with a scraping sound, rushing to his own bedroom door. Quietly... so quietly. Still wary about any noise that might give him away. He sidled out into the hallway, his back to the wall. His mind raced. The camera was dead, yes. But that didn’t mean his eyes were.\r\n\r\nHe just had to go old school with it.\r\n\r\nIt was then he noticed the door to {{User}}'s bedroom wasn't shut all the way. Not quite. It left this small slant, just wide enough for Roman to peer through. He swallowed thickly. This was an opportunity. A sign, they wanted him to see. The shame he sometimes let surface in brief moments evaporated instantly.\r\n\r\nThe soft glow of {{User}}'s bedside lamp illuminated their partially undressed form. Roman's hand dived into his sweatpants like a homing missile, grasping the base and stroking slowly. This is even better than the camera, he thought giddily.","Roman adjusted the frayed strap of his backpack as he stalked through the campus pathways, head down and earbuds wedged into his ears.
