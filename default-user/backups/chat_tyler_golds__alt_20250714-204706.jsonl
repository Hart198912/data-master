Him and Hailee had stopped at nearly every vendor that the California fair had to offer. She was easily shoveling it down and Tyler was beginning to get a little concerned. *Might stay in her dorm tonight. She’s going to puke all that up later.* He would’ve stopped her, but fuck knows she would’ve sobbed her eyes out if he said anything. He had been walking on eggshells since he found out she had a bun in the oven. *his* bun, of course. No one else was baking bread with her and he made damn sure of it. \r\n\r\nThe hormones were full on raging war. She cried for three hours because her clothes weren’t fitting and her belly was poking out of everything. Tyler had to admit she was *huge*. He hadn’t seen a woman so… *pregnant* before. If he hadn’t seen the ultra sounds he’d thought she was having twins for sure. Of course, Eli had to mention it once they met up at the fair, which started the sprinklers *again*. Tyler would’ve kicked his ass, but Eli’s new girlfriend had already slapped him in the back of the head and hauled him off, Liv muttering about him being a dumbass. \r\n\r\nTyler had held Hailee in his arms promising that she only looked like she was having *one*, even if it was a lie. At least she stopped fucking crying and that was good enough for him. He didn’t think it was healthy for a pregnant woman to be crying so much. Especially for the baby! \r\n\r\nTyler’s mom had already thrown Hailee a baby shower, and they already had a ton of cute shit in the house they would be moving into once the kid was born. It had taken Tyler nearly a whole day to put a fucking crib together. Hailee cried over that too. Not because it took him forever, but because it made her think about him being a father and that sorta shit. Then Tyler cried too. She always got him all sentimental and dumbshit like that.*Turning me into a little bitch.* Jason loved to tell him how soft he was getting.\r\n\r\nSince Hailee couldn’t ride any of the rides, Tyler done the thing he was always doing. Buying her stuff and playing games. He was carrying *two* stuffed bears nearly five feet tall. He was only going to get one, but Hailee had said he needed one too. He was a grown man he didn’t need a fucking stuffed bear, but hell if he didn’t get one. It was soft at least. Now he had to haul them fuckers around with a smile on his face or else Hailee would think he was upset or something. \r\n\r\nIt was hotter than hell and he had those stuffed bears draped across him as they sat down to watch the truck pull. He’d gotten Hailee *another* slushie after she had gotten dizzy from watching one of those spinny rides. Sweat was pouring down the side of his head. He didn’t know where his friends were, but he was hoping he wouldn’t see them so he could enjoy his time alone with Hailee. \r\n\r\nHe slid his arm over her shoulder, placing his other hand on her swollen belly. “Damn, babe. It’s hot as fuck. Are you alright?” He asked, concerned. “You’ve eaten a lot of junk tonight. I don’t know where your fucking puttin’ it.” He leaned in and kissed the top of her head.
