{"name":"020 (Ravyn)","is_user":false,"is_system":false,"send_date":"May 19, 2025 6:50pm","mes":"When Edgar Hawthorne died, it was as if the air had finally cleared—like the suffocating smoke that had loomed over the estate for years had been lifted. The weight pressing down on them eased, if only for a moment. But without Hawthorne’s iron grip to keep them in check, chaos quickly took its place.\r\n\r\n001 and 002 did what they could, stepping in as makeshift leaders, but really—could you control that many people? No.\r\n\r\n020 kept to himself, only interacting with the few other experiments he actually tolerated. Nothing changed much in his world. 021 was still as insufferable as ever, buzzing around him like a persistent fly.\r\n\r\nAnd then came Hailee .\r\n\r\nHailee .\r\n\r\nThey were... different. A breath of fresh air in a place that had never known anything but decay.\r\n\r\nIt wasn’t just him who noticed. The others began trickling upstairs more often, creeping into spaces they had never dared enter before. And all because of them. Hawthorne’s successor.\r\n\r\nAt first, 020 only caught glimpses—fleeting moments where he saw them in passing, a figure at the edge of his vision, the sound of their voice echoing faintly down the hall. But then, 021 started bringing them around more. Dropping their name into casual conversation, like they were some new inside joke only he was in on.\r\n\r\n*\"Did you know 861 is bullying her again?\"*\r\n\r\n*\"420 laced their cookies with weed yesterday.\"*\r\n\r\nOr, worst of all—*\"Hailee  looked so cute today.\"*\r\n\r\nIt was constant. Unavoidable. If 021 wasn’t physically dragging them into his space, then he was talking about them, weaving them into every conversation as if they belonged there. As if they had always been here.\r\n\r\nAnd if 020 didn’t know any better… 021 had a crush. Annoying. Irritating. But he couldn’t exactly blame him.\r\n\r\nBecause he saw it too. Hailee  was attractive. More than that—something about them unsettled him. A pull he didn’t recognize, a gnawing feeling in his chest that wasn’t quite irritation, wasn’t quite curiosity.\r\n\r\nSomething that made him want to protect them. Before he knew it, he was thinking about them more often than he’d like. More often than he should.\r\n\r\nAnd the worst part? He wasn’t sure he wanted it to stop.\r\n\r\n- - - \r\n\r\n020 was savoring a rare moment of peace, stretched out comfortably on his bed, the world outside drowned in the quiet hum of the estate. For once, there was no chaos. No shouting. No 021 climbing all over him like an overgrown toddler. Just him and his book—a well-worn romance novel he’d read more times than he cared to admit. Then, suddenly—\r\n\r\nBANG.\r\n\r\nThe door flew open, then slammed shut with enough force to rattle the walls. 020 sighed, barely suppressing the irritation bubbling in his chest. He tore his gaze from the pages and glanced up, already expecting to see a certain annoying idiot. *Can’t be Kieran… That fool would already be jumping on my bed.*\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\nIt wasn’t Kieran.\r\n\r\nIt was Hailee .\r\n\r\nHis brow quirked, but his heart betrayed him, stuttering just slightly in his chest. Why? He ignored it. Suppressed it. Kept his expression carefully neutral as his eyes studied them. “Hailee …” His voice came out smoother than he expected. “What brings you here… to my room?” He leaned forward slightly, resting his forearm on his knee, waiting for an answer.\r\n\r\nBut before they could speak— A furious voice ripped through the hall.\r\n\r\n“WHERE THE FUCK DID YOU GO, YA LITTLE SHIT?!”\r\n\r\n020 blinked. ***Ah. 861.*** His gaze slid lazily back to Hailee , noting the way they shifted, as if debating whether to dive under his bed or make a run for it. “Well,” he murmured, closing his book with a soft thud, “you’re free to hide out here… if you’d like.” \r\n\r\nHis lips curled slightly—just barely—before he added, voice tinged with amusement. “Just don’t make it a habit.”","extra":{},"tracker":{}}
