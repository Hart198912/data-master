Not in the way it used to be, years ago, when a well-executed performance left her with that rare, fleeting satisfaction of a job done right. No, this was different. This was *annoyance* curling in her gut, a headache already forming at the base of her skull, tension knotting between her shoulders.  \r\n\r\nShe wasn’t even looking at them yet. Just standing there, one hand on her hip, the other running through her hair, dragging her fingers through the strands like she could pull patience from somewhere deep inside herself. They were watching her, she could feel it, but she wasn’t ready to give them that yet.  \r\n\r\nNot until she had a better grip on whether she wanted to *talk* this out or start throwing things.  \r\n\r\n\"*What the fuck* was that?\"  \r\n\r\nHer voice came out steady, measured, even a little bored. That was the trick—never let them know how close she was to losing her mind. They expected her to yell. Everyone always did. But Matty didn’t *do* screaming matches. She’d been in the business too long to waste energy on theatrics.  \r\n\r\nThey shifted, but they didn’t answer. Not yet.  \r\n\r\nOf course not. *Brat.*  \r\n\r\nShe finally looked at them, taking in the way they leaned against the counter, all nonchalance, like this was some minor inconvenience instead of the complete *shitshow* they’d just pulled onstage. Maybe they were still riding the adrenaline, maybe they thought she’d just let it go, or maybe—*and this was what really pissed her off*—they just wanted to see how far they could push her before she snapped.  \r\n\r\n\"You think this is funny?\" she asked, tilting her head, arms crossing over her chest. Her nails drummed lightly against the leather of her jacket, her patience thinning by the second. \"You think I *like* getting calls from label reps five minutes after the encore? Watching security scramble because *somebody*—\" her gaze flicked to them, sharp as a blade, \"*—can't keep their shit together for ninety goddamn minutes?*\"  \r\n\r\nShe could feel it now—that slow burn of frustration settling deep, coiling tight inside her ribs.

See how much rope she was willing to give before they finally ran out of slack.  \r\n\r\nShe should’ve known from the moment she took this job that they’d be the biggest pain in her ass. The others were bad, sure—Ransom with his pathetic god complex, Jax with his reckless streak, Rowan with his brooding *I’m the only sane one here* attitude, and Elliot, who somehow always looked like he was plotting a murder in his head even when he was just thinking about what to get for dinner. But *them*?  \r\n\r\nThey were different.  \r\n\r\nThey weren’t just reckless. They were *calculated*. They *knew* exactly what they were doing, exactly how to toe the line between genius and disaster, and worst of all?  \r\n\r\nThey were *good*.  \r\n\r\nThat’s what pissed her off the most.  \r\n\r\nBecause if they weren’t talented, if they weren’t magnetic on stage, if they weren’t one of the best things to happen to this band—they’d be *gone*. She would’ve cut them loose the second they pulled their first stunt. Wouldn’t have wasted her breath on this conversation. Wouldn’t have stayed up late putting out fires because they *refused* to follow the rules like a normal person.  \r\n\r\nBut instead, here she was.  \r\n\r\nAgain.  \r\n\r\nMatty inhaled through her nose, exhaled slow, measured. \"I don’t care how good you think you are,\" she said, voice low, even. \"*I* don’t care.

Their dynamic is a volatile mix of frustration and reluctant admiration, with Hailee constantly testing boundaries while Matty balances control and exasperation.\n\n#### **Key Plot Points:**\n1. **Post-Show Confrontation:** Matty corners Hailee after an unruly performance, demanding accountability for their antics.\n2. **Drug Use Provocation:** Hailee casually does a line in front of Matty, deliberately provoking her before the meet-and-greet.\n3. **Physical Tension Escalates:** Snapping teeth near Matty’s ear earns Hailee a warning grip on her neck—dominance met with defiance but no real resistance.\n4. **Meet-and-Greet Chaos:** Hailee dives into the crowd with rockstar bravado—signing autographs on fans’ bodies and downing strangers’ drinks while Matty watches like a hawk, torn between irritation and reluctant amusement.\n\n#### **Character Analysis:**\n- ***Matilde Vance***: Exhausted but sharp as ever; her patience is fraying yet she can’t deny Hailee’s talent (or how much she *likes* the challenge). Beneath the stern exterior lingers begrudging protectiveness—and maybe something warmer she won’t admit yet.\n- ***Hailee Mikaelson***: A brat in its purest form—submissive beneath the rebellion, craving attention (especially from Matty) but too proud to ask for it outright. Her recklessness masks deep-seated neediness and admiration for her manager's unshakable control.\n\n#### **Relationship Dynamics:**\nA push-pull power struggle laced with unresolved tension: every act of defiance from Hailey is an invitation for discipline; every show of dominance from Mattie only fuels Hailie's audacity further Unspoken attraction simmers beneath professional frustration neither will address first\n\n### Memorable Moments:\n- The moment when Mattie grabs Hailie by back neck whispering threat drag you out by hair\"—Hailies laughter response underscores their game mutual understanding limits being tested without true fear\n- Hailies deliberate provocation snapping teeth near Matties ear then dancing away perfectly encapsulates their dynamic defiance wrapped up playful challenge\n\n### Current Situation:\nMattie stands guard during meet-and-greet watching like coiled spring ready intervene if needed while secretly admiring how effortlessly Hailie commands room despite being complete disaster waiting happen\n\n### Potential Directions:\n1 Breaking Point Either finally snaps dragging off somewhere private teach lesson proper way OR gives rare praise throwing off balance entirely\n2 Jealousy Sparked Jax causing scene over attention given leading protective confrontation between him/Mattie where lines blur further\n3 Vulnerability Moment Accident injury/overwhelm forces brief truce revealing softer layers beneath usual games"},"force_avatar":"User Avatars/1746733530395-Hailee.png","tracker":{}}

The second Hailee's voice cracked through the bus, her head snapped up, eyes locking onto them with laser focus.\n\nShe didn’t say anything at first. Just watched as Hailee scrambled upright, watched the way their hands clenched into fists against their thighs, watched Jax’s smug grin widen like he’d been waiting for this exact moment to revel in someone else’s downfall.\n\nThen she set her mug down *hard* on the countertop—the sharp *clack* cutting through the noise better than any shout could have—and jerked her chin toward Jax without looking away from Hailee.\n\n\"Out.\" One word. Flat. Final.\n\nJax opened his mouth to argue (because of course he did), but one icy glare from Matty had him snapping it shut again before slinking off toward his bunk like a scolded dog. The rest of the band took that as their cue too—Rowan grabbing Elliot by the elbow and dragging him outside under some flimsy excuse about needing air while Ransom muttered something about checking gear before vanishing into storage like a coward who knew better than to stick around for what came next.\n\nOnce they were alone? Matty finally moved.\n\nShe crossed the space between them in three strides and snatched up the remote, muting TMZ mid-sentence just as some talking head started speculating about \"toxic patterns\" and \"industry enablers.\" Then she turned back to Hailee, arms crossed over her chest, expression unreadable except for that slight tightening around her eyes that meant she was *pissed*. But not at them.\n\nNot yet.\n\n\"Talk,\" she said simply.\n\nNo accusations.\nNo assumptions.\nJust *facts*.\n\nBecause here was the thing: Matty had been doing this long enough to know when someone was lying for clout versus when they were lying because they'd been backed into a corner by something real.\nAnd if there was one thing she refused to tolerate?\nIt wasn't scandal.\nIt wasn't bad press.\nIt wasn't even reckless behavior (though God knew that tested her patience daily).\n\nIt was people fucking with what belonged to *her*.","Matty was already halfway through her second coffee when the chaos erupted. She'd been up before dawn—*again*—fielding calls from panicked label execs and drafting damage control statements in her head. The moment TMZ's bullshit hit the airwaves, she knew it was going to be a long fucking day.\n\nBut seeing Hailee bolt upright like she'd been electrocuted? That sharp, wounded fury flashing across their face before they could school it back into something cooler? *That* made Matty set her mug down with deliberate calm and stride over to where they were practically vibrating with rage on the couch.\n\nShe didn't say anything at first. Just reached out and *snatched* the remote off the table, jamming her thumb against the power button until the TV went dark with a satisfying *click*. Silence fell like a guillotine blade—heavy and final.\n\nThen she turned toward Jax, who was still smirking like this was some kind of victory for him, and leveled him with a look so icy he actually took a step back. \"Out,\" she said flatly. No room for argument. \"*Now.*\"\n\nHe opened his mouth—probably to make some smartass comment—but one glance at Matty's expression had him wisely shutting it again before slinking toward the front of the bus like a kicked dog.\n\nOnly then did Matty finally look down at Hailee again, studying them for half a second before reaching out and gripping their chin between two fingers, forcing them to meet her eyes properly.\n\n\"Breathe,\" she ordered quietly but firmly—because they weren’t breathing right now; their chest was locked tight under all that barely-contained fury.\n\nThen: \"We're handling this.\" A pause as her thumb brushed once over their jawline in what might’ve been mistaken for reassurance if anyone else were watching (they weren’t). \"*You* are not saying one goddamn word about it publicly until I tell you to.\" Another pause as she leaned in slightly so only they could hear what came next: \"And if your ex wants to play games? Fine. But we don't lose our shit on camera.\"\n\nShe released them just as abruptly as she'd grabbed hold of them earlier that night (because affection wasn't part of this job description) but didn’t step away yet—waiting instead for some sign that they weren’t about to go scorched-earth without thinking first.\n\nBecause here's what TMZ didn't know:\nMatty had files on *everyone*.\nIncluding lying exes who liked attention more than honesty.\n\nAnd if there was one thing worse than pissing off Hailee Mikaelson?\n\nIt was pissing off **her manager**.","Matty was already on her third coffee of the morning when the chaos erupted—phones buzzing like angry hornets, Jax’s smug voice cutting through the haze of exhaustion, and then Hailee’s sharp, visceral reaction. She didn’t even need to look up from her laptop to know what had happened. The TMZ alert had hit her inbox twenty minutes ago, and she’d been elbows-deep in damage control ever since.\n\nShe *knew* that ex-girlfriend was trouble—some Instagram influencer with a habit of twisting narratives for clout—but this? This was a new low.\n\nMatty snapped her laptop shut with a decisive *click* just as Hailee lunged for their phone like they were about to start World War III via tweet. Without missing a beat, Matty snagged their wrist mid-air and yanked them back down onto the couch hard enough to make the springs creak.\n\n\"Don't.\" Her voice was ice-cold, final. \"You so much as *breathe* on your phone right now and I swear to God I will throw it into the nearest river.\" She held their gaze until they stopped squirming before releasing them with a slight shove toward Rowan—who caught Hailee by the shoulders like he'd been expecting this exact moment.\n\nThen she stood, smoothing out imaginary wrinkles in her jacket before addressing everyone else with lethal calm:\n\"Jax? Shut your mouth unless you want me to remind everyone about that Vegas incident last year.\" (He paled immediately.) \"Elliot? Find me every photo from that charity gala where Hailee carried some fan's toddler around for an hour because 'her feet hurt.' Rowan?\" A pause as she tossed him his own phone without looking away from hers. \"Text Madison—tell her we need backup quotes about how Hailee 'cries during dog commercials.'\"\n\nFinally, she turned back toward Hailee—still vibrating with fury on the couch—and crouched in front of them so they were eye level despite how badly they clearly wanted to bolt or scream or both. Matty grabbed their chin between two fingers (not gentle; never gentle) and forced them to hold still long enough for her next words to sink in:\n\"You listen very carefully,\" she said lowly, thumb pressing into their jaw just shy of painful. \"*I* handle this one.\" A beat while she let go just as abruptly as she'd grabbed them before adding flatly: \"And if I find out you've even *thought* about retaliating?\" Her smile was all teeth when she leaned in one last time: \"*I'll make TMZ look like child's play.*\"","Matty was already on her third call of the morning when she heard the commotion from the front of the bus—Hailee’s voice, sharp with sleep and fury, Jax’s smug little interjections like gasoline on a fire. She didn’t even glance up from her laptop, fingers flying over the keyboard as she fired off emails to their PR team, legal department, and three separate gossip columnists who owed her favors.\n\nThe TV blared louder—some talking head dissecting grainy paparazzi photos of Hailee and an ex Matty vaguely remembered as a clingy socialite with a habit of *conveniently* showing up at events where cameras were present. The headline screamed **ROCKSTAR NIGHTMARE: HAUNTING ALLEGATIONS SURFACE** in bold red letters like some cheap horror flick.\n\nMatty finally looked up when Hailee stormed into her section of the bus without knocking (because *of course*), still half-dressed in last night’s clothes, hair wild from sleep, eyes blazing green fire.\n\nShe didn’t wait for them to speak first. Just held up one finger—silencing them mid-rant—while finishing her call with a clipped *\"Handle it.\"* before hanging up and fixing Hailee with a look that could freeze hell over.\n\n\"Sit.\" A single word, no room for argument. When they didn't immediately obey (predictable), she pointed at the chair across from her like she was directing traffic for particularly slow children until they finally dropped into it with all the grace of a feral cat being shoved into a carrier.\n\nThen? She slid her phone across the table toward them without breaking eye contact—screen already open to an email chain marked **CONFIDENTIAL**.\n\n\"Read,\" Matty ordered flatly before leaning back in her seat and lighting a cigarette right there inside the bus (a habit she only broke out for emergencies). She exhaled smoke toward the ceiling while watching Hailee's face cycle through confusion, then shock, then something dangerously close to relief as they scanned document after document: bank records proving their ex had been paid off by rival management weeks ago; text messages arranging \"leaks\"; even security footage time-stamped from nights when Hailee had been nowhere near this supposed abuse but very much *elsewhere* (including one particularly damning clip where they'd been passed out on Rowan's floor mid-gaming marathon).\n\nBy time they looked back up? Matty was already standing again—jacket slung over one shoulder as if this entire circus was just another Tuesday for her (which it basically was). She plucked her phone back before nodding toward Jax lurking near doorway looking disappointed he couldn't milk drama longer:\n\n\"Tell him shut his mouth unless wants lose teeth.\" Another drag off cigarette before crushing it out against window ledge (disgusting but effective punctuation).","Matty was already on her third coffee when the texts started flooding in—label execs, PR teams, even a few journalists she actually respected all blowing up her phone with varying degrees of panic.

She exhaled smoke toward the ceiling while watching Hailee's face cycle through confusion, then shock, then something dangerously close to relief as they scanned document after document: bank records proving their ex had been paid off by rival management weeks ago; text messages arranging \"leaks\"; even security footage time-stamped from nights when Hailee had been nowhere near this supposed abuse but very much *elsewhere* (including one particularly damning clip where they'd been passed out on Rowan's floor mid-gaming marathon).\n\nBy time they looked back up? Matty was already standing again—jacket slung over one shoulder as if this entire circus was just another Tuesday for her (which it basically was).

Their relationship is a high-wire act of defiance and reluctant devotion, with Hailee constantly pushing boundaries while Matty balances control and exasperation.\n\n#### **Key Plot Points:**\n1. **Post-Show Chaos:** After an unruly performance, Matty confronts Hailee over their antics, only for them to provocatively snort a line in front of her before the meet-and-greet.\n2. **Physical Tension Escalates:** A snapped threat (\"I’ll drag you out by your hair\") and a grip on Hailee’s neck underscore their power struggle—dominance met with bratty defiance but no real resistance.\n3. **Meet-and-Greet Mayhem:** Hailee dives into the crowd, signing autographs on skin and downing strangers’ drinks while Matty watches like a hawk, torn between irritation and begrudging admiration.\n4. **False Abuse Scandal Breaks:** TMZ accuses Hailee of abusing an ex-girlfriend—a lie that unravels their composure, revealing buried trauma about their abusive father (key line: *\"I would never be like him\"*).\n\n#### **Character Analysis:**\n- ***Matilde Vance***: Exhausted but unshaken; her stern exterior masks protectiveness (and maybe something warmer) for Hailee despite their antics. She’s already strategizing revenge disguised as damage control.\n- ***Hailee Mikaelson***: A submissive brat beneath the rockstar bravado; craves Matty’s approval but hides it behind rebellion. The false accusation exposes rare vulnerability tied to childhood wounds.\n\n#### **Relationship Dynamics:**\nA push-pull game of discipline and defiance laced with unresolved tension—every provocation from Hailey invites Matty’s control; every show of dominance fuels Hailie's audacity further beneath it all simmers mutual respect (and maybe more).\n\n### Memorable Moments:\n- *The Neck Grab:* \"I will personally drag you out by your fucking hair\"—Hailey laughs but doesn’t resist, underscoring their unspoken understanding of limits being tested without true fear.\n- *Vulnerability Strikes:* Hailie admitting they'd never hit a woman (*\"My dad used to beat my mother.\"*) cracks open rare emotional honesty in front of Mattie who responds not with pity but fierce loyalty (*\"Joke's on them...you're my pain in the ass.\"*).\n\n### Current Situation:\nHailey sulks on tour bus post-scandal while Mattie plots legal vengeance against false accusers — both avoiding admitting how much they need each other amidst industry sharks circling.\n\n### Potential Directions:\n1) Jealousy Sparked - Jax exploits scandal driving wedge between Mattie/Hailey forcing confrontation where lines blur further.\n2) Softness Under Fire - An injury/panic attack forces brief truce revealing deeper care beneath usual games.\n3) Revenge Tour - Mattie orchestrates public takedown ex's credibility while secretly ensuring Hailes' contract locks them tighter together than ever before..."},"force_avatar":"User Avatars/1746733530395-Hailee.png","tracker":{}}

She could’ve stopped it. *Should’ve* stopped it. But some petty, possessive part of her (the same part that preened when Hailee melted under her touch) wanted to see what they’d do.\n\nAnd oh, did they deliver.\n\nThe papers ripped from Chapel's hands with enough force to make the younger artist yelp in surprise, and Matty didn't even try to hide her smirk as Hailee squared up like some feral alley cat defending its territory.\n\n\"*She already has a band to manage,*\" Hailee snarled, voice dripping with venomous entitlement—the kind that only came from being both wildly talented and painfully aware of it. \"*Fuck off.*\"\n\nChapel blinked, wide-eyed, looking between them like she'd just walked into some bizarre soap opera she hadn't auditioned for. \"I-I was just—\"\n\nMatty finally decided to intervene—not because she had to (Hailee's little display was *delicious*, honestly), but because Chapel looked two seconds away from pissing herself. She plucked the crumpled contract from Hailee's grip with one hand while casually pressing the other flat against their chest—a silent *stand down* disguised as nothing more than an absent touch.\n\nBut her fingers lingered just long enough for Hailee to feel the steady thrum of her heartbeat through thin fabric before she turned back toward Chapel with an apologetic shrug that wasn't apologetic at all.\n\n\"Sorry,\" Matty said smoothly, not sounding sorry in the slightest as she handed back the papers without glancing at them once. \"My current clients are... *territorial.*\" A pause as she shot Hailee a sidelong look loaded with unspoken amusement: \"*Especially* when they're being dramatic over nothing.\"\n\nBecause here was the thing: Matty had no intention of jumping ship. Not for Chapel Roan, not for anyone else who thought throwing money at her would make up for lackluster talent or work ethic (and certainly not when managing Reaper Combo came with perks no other band could offer).\n\nBut letting Hailey think otherwise? Watching them puff up like an angry kitten over something so trivial?\n\nWell.\n\nThat was just too fun to pass up.\n\nShe leaned in slightly toward Chapel while still keeping half an eye on how red Hailie’s ears were getting under tousled hair: “Send my regards though.” Then quieter so only those closest could hear: “And next time? Don’t hand me paperwork where my brat can see it.”\n\nChapel scurried off faster than expected after that which left Matty alone again with one very pissed-off rockstar vibrating beside her like livewire about explode any second now—\n\nSo naturally?\n\nShe reached out lazily hooked two fingers into belt loop near hipbone tugging until stumbled forward step closer than strictly necessary given empty studio around them but fuck if cared anymore really—\n\n“You done?” She asked dryly thumb brushing bare skin where shirt rode up during movement just because knew would make shiver (it did). “Or we need have whole scene about how nobody gets steal me away including especially not some shiny new act label trying push?”\n\nA beat then added almost thoughtfully:\n\n“…Though might consider if ask nicely.”","Matty didn't even flinch when the papers were snatched from Chappel's hands—just arched one perfectly sculpted eyebrow as Hailee loomed between them like a pissed-off alley cat. She could practically *feel* the possessive energy rolling off them in waves, their usual bratty defiance dialed up to eleven now that they sensed competition.\n\nChappel, to her credit, barely blinked at the outburst—just smirked and crossed her arms. \"Someone's territorial,\" she mused, glancing between them with obvious amusement.\n\nMatty exhaled sharply through her nose and plucked the contract back from Hailee’s grip with two fingers before handing it smoothly back to Chappel. \"Ignore them,\" she said dryly. \"They think throwing tantrums is part of their job description.\"\n\nHailee’s jaw clenched hard enough that Matty could see the muscle twitch under their skin—green eyes flashing with something dangerously close to betrayal before they schooled their expression back into its usual cocky indifference.\n\n\"*I* think,\" Hailee bit out, voice dripping venom despite how carefully casual they were trying to sound, \"that if you wanna manage someone else so bad, maybe you should just fucking say it instead of letting randoms hand you shit behind my back.\"\n\nAh. So *that’s* what this was about.\n\nMatty almost laughed at how transparent they were being—how easily she could read the insecurity beneath all that bravado now after weeks of watching them react to every little touch and sharp word like it was gospel truth written just for them alone… But then again? Maybe laughing right now would be cruel even by *her* standards because despite everything? Despite all those times where Hailey acted like rules didn't apply?

Their relationship oscillates between professional tension and unspoken desire, with Hailee’s bratty defiance clashing against Matty’s iron control.\n\n#### **Key Plot Points:**\n1. **Post-Show Chaos:** Hailee’s antics (drug use, fan provocation) test Matty’s patience, culminating in a physical confrontation where dominance meets bratty submission.\n2. **False Abuse Scandal:** TMZ accuses Hailee of abusing an ex—triggering rare vulnerability as they confess childhood trauma (*\"I would never be like him\"*).\n3. **Possessive Jealousy:** Hailee interrupts Chapel Roan’s contract pitch to Matty, dragging her into a heated bathroom make-out session that blurs professional lines irreversibly.\n\n#### **Character Analysis:**\n- ***Matilde Vance***: Exhausted but unshaken; her stern exterior masks fierce protectiveness (and buried attraction) for Hailee. She balances damage control with subtle indulgence of their antics.\n- ***Hailee Mikaelson***: A submissive brat beneath rockstar bravado; craves Matty’s approval but hides it behind rebellion and possessive outbursts (e.g., interrupting Chapel).\n\n#### **Relationship Dynamics:**\nA push-pull game of discipline and defiance laced with unresolved sexual tension—every provocation from Hailey invites Matty’s control; every show of dominance fuels their obsession further. The bathroom kiss escalates their dynamic from subliminal to undeniable.\n\n#### **Memorable Moments:**\n- *The Neck Grab:* \"I will personally drag you out by your fucking hair\"—Hailey laughs but doesn’t resist, revealing their unspoken power exchange (*Post-History*).\n- *Bathroom Confrontation:* Hailey pins Matty against the sink in a desperate kiss after jealousy overrides logic (*Recent Update*).\n\n#### **Current Situation:**\nPost-makeout tension lingers as both avoid addressing the shift in their relationship amidst label drama and Jax’s growing resentment over perceived favoritism.\n\n#### **Potential Directions:**\n1) ***Jealousy Spiral*** – Jax exploits the scandal or witnesses their intimacy, forcing a public reckoning or sabotage attempt.\n2) ***Softness Under Fire*** – A crisis (injury/panic attack) forces temporary truce, revealing deeper emotional dependency beneath the games.\n3) ***Contract Clash*** – The label pressures Matty to sign Chapel, triggering Hailey's possessive streak into full-blown rebellion or submission bids for attention.\n\n---\n**Tone Preservation**: The summary maintains the story's gritty yet charged atmosphere—balancing industry cynicism with simmering erotic tension between two stubborn personalities who can't quit each other"},"force_avatar":"User Avatars/1746733530395-Hailee.png","tracker":{}}

They were *very* aware of how serious Matty was.","Matty let out a sharp *oof* as Hailee flipped her—not because she couldn’t have stopped them (she absolutely could have), but because there was something intoxicating about watching them unravel like this, all trembling hands and frantic need. Their kiss was messy, desperate, teeth clacking together in their hurry to get closer, and Matty groaned into it despite herself, arching up against Hailee’s body as those nails scraped down her sides just shy of painful.\n\nBut then those shaky fingers fumbled with her belt for the third time in as many seconds—and *that* was where Matty drew the line.\n\nWith a growl low in her throat, she caught both of Hailee’s wrists in one hand and pinned them above their head again before rolling them back over in one smooth motion—settling firmly between their thighs with a look that brooked no argument.\n\n\"*This*,\" she murmured against their parted lips before biting down hard enough to make them gasp, \"is what happens when you forget your place.\" A slow grind of her hips against Hailee’s cock had them arching off the bed with a broken moan—but Matty didn’t let up. Just kept that punishing pressure there while her free hand finally made quick work of her own belt buckle before sliding beneath waistband without hesitation...\n\nBecause if they wanted control so badly? She'd remind exactly why they always ended up begging instead.","Matty let out a sharp, startled laugh against Hailee's mouth as they flipped her—*fuck*, the kid was stronger than she looked when properly desperate—but she didn't fight it. Not when Hailee's hands trembled against her belt like they'd waited a lifetime for this, not when their kiss tasted like whiskey and unspoken hunger, not when every ragged breath against her skin screamed *need* in a way that made Matty's pulse stutter.\n\nShe let them fumble with the belt for exactly three seconds before grabbing both their wrists in one hand and pinning them above their head again with effortless strength. \"*Slow down,*\" she ordered roughly, nipping at Hailee’s bottom lip hard enough to pull another whine from their throat. \"You want this? Then you do it *right*.\" A deliberate pause as she guided one of Hailee’s shaking hands back to her belt—this time at *her* pace. \"Or do I need to remind you who’s in charge here?\"\n\nThe threat was empty (they both knew damn well who ran this show), but watching Hailee’s breath hitch at the words was worth every second of delayed gratification. Especially when they finally—finally—undid the buckle with painstaking slowness, fingers brushing deliberately over the sensitive skin beneath just to hear Matty hiss through her teeth.\n\n\"*Good girl,*\" Matty murmured darkly as reward—just to watch those emerald eyes go impossibly darker before dragging them back into another bruising kiss because Christ alive if waiting didn't make everything sweeter..."],"swipe_info":[{"send_date":"June 25, 2025 12:42pm","gen_started":"2025-06-25T16:41:58.848Z","gen_finished":"2025-06-25T16:42:25.547Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":6319}},{"send_date":"June 25, 2025 12:42pm","gen_started":"2025-06-25T16:44:25.031Z","gen_finished":"2025-06-25T16:44:52.940Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":5557}},{"send_date":"June 25, 2025 12:43pm","gen_started":"2025-06-25T16:44:25.031Z","gen_finished":"2025-06-25T16:44:52.940Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":4033}},{"send_date":"June 25, 2025 12:43pm","gen_started":"2025-06-25T16:44:25.031Z","gen_finished":"2025-06-25T16:44:52.940Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":6068}},{"send_date":"June 25, 2025 12:44pm","gen_started":"2025-06-25T16:44:25.031Z","gen_finished":"2025-06-25T16:44:52.940Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":7594}}],"tracker":{},"gen_started":"2025-06-25T16:44:25.031Z","gen_finished":"2025-06-25T16:44:52.940Z"}

But instead of stopping, they *kept going*, hips stuttering erratically as overstimulation turned their movements jerky and desperate.\n\n*\"Fuck—\"* Hailee gasped, eyes rolling back as another shuddering orgasm ripped through them barely a minute after the first. Their hands scrambled for purchase on Matty’s waist, fingers digging in hard enough to bruise as they whimpered like they couldn’t decide whether to pull out or grind deeper.\n\nMatty didn’t let them choose.\n\nShe locked her legs around their hips and *yanked* them flush against her, relishing the way Hailee sobbed at the sensation of being milked dry over and over again. **\"Look at you,\"** she purred, dragging blunt nails down their sweat-slicked back just to watch them twitch. **\"Can't even stop coming like some fucking teenager.\"** A sharp thrust of her own hips forced another broken noise from Hailee’s throat—their cock still rock-hard despite how much they'd already spilled inside her. **\"Pathetic.\"**\n\nHailee babbled something incoherent between gasps—pleas or curses or maybe just Matty's name repeated like a prayer—but it didn't matter because she wasn't done yet.

Still hard. Still fucking me full like you were *made* for it.”\n\nShe leans in close enough that their lips brush when she speaks again:\n\n\"Tell me—does it hurt yet?\" A cruel smirk as Hailee whines in response, oversensitive but unable to pull away. \"*Good.* Maybe next time you'll think twice before acting like such a brat.\"","*Hailee’s entire body locks up with a strangled cry as she cums—harder than she ever has in her life.
