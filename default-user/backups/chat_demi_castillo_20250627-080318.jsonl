Demi’s feet cried each time she took a step up to her apartment, her body stiff and achy. She felt like it had been forever since she let down her guard, relaxed a little. She was finally back home after going to a job all the way in Fort Lauderdale with her boss. Elias had promised her that they’d be back the same day but surprise, surprise, shit ain’t ever work out the way she wanted it to. Two hours turned to two days in a shitty motel and annoying ass clients.\r\n\r\nNot to mention she’s sure Hailee is gonna be pissed as fuck at her. Hailee had sent her a text that night asking where she was, all worried n’ shit like usual. Demi was gonna respond, on her mama, but then she got pulled into a deal and she wasn’t keepin’ Elias waiting. The man signed her checks.\r\n\r\nNow, Demi loves Hailee, don’t get her wrong, that’s her future wife BUT her baby could be a lil’... dramatic. Always fussing about how late Demi is out, always up in her business about how dangerous a job could be. No matter how many times they have the ‘I know what I’m doing’ talk, Hailee always seems to have something to bitch about. All Demi wanted to do was get upstairs get inside and put her face-\r\n\r\n“The fuck?” Demi mutters as she twists the door handle, the door not budging. She tries her key again, her brows furrowing in frustration. Demi knocks on the door, running a hand down her face, “Yo, mamas, come get the door!” She calls, knocking on the door a little harder, “Hailee? Come open the door, ma, it’s late as fuck.” She pulled out her phone to call Hailee, it was late, maybe she was asleep. Demi pulls up their messages to see several texts. Sent two days ago. Fuck.\r\n\r\nIf you ain’t home tonight, I’m changing the locks. For real this time.\r\n\r\n“God dammit..” Demi curses under her breath, holding her duffle bag a little tighter. “Make me do shit the hard way..” Demi walks about the side of their building, cursing in Spanish under her breath as she comes up to the window. Thank God, she got a first floor unit. Demi tested the window, opening it while taking a mental note to scold Hailee on keeping the windows unlocked. The apartment was empty, quiet. That kinda pissed Demi off. Where the fuck was her girl? And why didn’t she text Demi and tell her where she’d be?\r\n\r\nDemi takes a seat on the arm chair, leg bouncing as she thinks about where Hailee could be. She ain’t cheatin’, Demi reminds herself, she ain’t like Mari. She’s different. Her mind runs with ideas. When the lock clicks, the door opens with that god awful squeaking noise the landlord promised to fix, Demi’s up fast. Demi walks up to Hailee, all smiley and flirty, “Miss me, mami?” Demi asks, voice husky and surprisingly calm. Maybe if Demi acts sweet enough, Hailee will forget this whole mess. “Why’d you lock me out, pretty girl? Come on, you ain’t that mad, right?”","extra":{},"tracker":{}}

She reaches out and gently grabs Hailee’s wrist—not hard enough to hurt, just enough to stop her from walking away again.\n\n\"Baby,\" she says, voice low but firm. \"Talk to me.\" Her thumb rubs small circles against the inside of Hailee’s wrist—a silent plea for patience instead of another cold shoulder. \"I know you mad as hell right now, but don’t shut me out like this.\"\n\nShe exhales through her nose when Hailee still doesn't respond immediately, jaw tightening slightly before forcing herself to soften again. \"*Por favor*, mami,\" she murmurs, stepping closer so their bodies are almost touching—close enough that if Hailee wanted to pull away completely, she could easily do it without resistance from Demi’s grip on her wrist. \"Tell me what I gotta do.\"","Demi's smile falters as Hailee straight up ignores her. \"Ay, mami, don't be like that,\" she mutters, following Hailee out to the car with long strides.

The silence is killing her more than any argument would. She bumps the car door closed with her hip and follows close behind as they head back inside.\n\nSetting the groceries down roughly on the counter, Demi turns and cages Hailee against it with both hands planted on either side of her hips. \"You gonna give me the silent treatment all night?\" she asks lowly, searching those emerald green eyes she loves so much. Her thumb comes up to brush along Hailee's bottom lip before she can stop herself - an old habit when trying to soften her girl up.\n\nThe scent of sandalwood and weed clings to Demi as she leans in closer still, voice dropping to that rough whisper that always makes Hailee shiver: \"I know you missed me... I saw how you looked at me when I came through that window.\" A cocky smirk plays at her lips despite knowing full well she's probably digging herself deeper into trouble here.","Demi's smile falters as Hailee ignores her completely, walking right past without so much as a glance. \"Ay, mami...\" She mutters under her breath, watching those swaying hips disappear back out the door.\n\nShe cracks her knuckles absentmindedly before following after Hailee into the parking lot. The summer heat hits her immediately, making the back of her neck prickle with sweat. Demi leans against their beat-up sedan as Hailee wrestles with more grocery bags from the trunk.\n\n\"Let me help you with that,\" Demi offers, reaching for the bags only for Hailee to yank them away sharply.\n\n\"No.\" That single word cuts through the humid air like ice.\n\nDemi exhales through her nose, rolling her shoulders back to ease some tension. \"Come on baby... I know you mad but—\"\n\n\"You were gone for two days.\" Hailee finally turns those emerald eyes on her - normally so warm but now flashing dangerously in that way that means trouble. Her slight southern drawl is giving way to something sharper beneath it all.\n\n\"I texted!\"\n\n\"After twenty-four hours!\" The Italian accent bleeds through now as she shoves past Demi again, grocery bags crinkling angrily in protest.\n\nDemi follows close behind like a chastised puppy, holding open doors and hovering hands just in case any bag slips from those trembling fingers she knows too well are itching to throw something at her head by now.\n\nThe apartment door slams shut behind them hard enough to rattle their cheap framed photos on the wall - one of which (their first vacation together) tilts precariously before Demi catches it with quick reflexes honed from years in this business.\n\nShe watches silently as Hailee starts violently unpacking groceries - eggs hitting countertop harder than necessary, canned goods clanking together like warning shots across a bow.\n\n\"You gonna tell me where you were?\" The question comes out deceptively calm despite how white-knuckled those slender fingers are around a jar of pasta sauce right now.\n\n\"Fort Lauderdale job ran long—\"\n\n\"That's bullshit and you know it!\" Glass meets countertop with a sharp crack that makes them both freeze momentarily before checking if anything actually broke this time (it didn't). \"Elias always brings everyone home same day unless—\"\n\n\"Mira...\" Demi steps closer cautiously when she sees tears starting to gather along those thick lashes despite how angry they both are pretending not be right now \"...you know sometimes shit gets complicated yeah?

Te lo juro por mi madre.\" Her grip tightens just enough to keep Hailee from wriggling free but not enough to hurt. \"Now either hit me proper or let me make it up to you but STOP throwing our shit!\"","Demi barely ducks in time as the first can whizzes past her ear, eyes going wide. \"The fuck—?!\" She stumbles back as Hailee starts *screaming* in rapid-fire Italian, another projectile already airborne.\n\nShe bolts for the door just as a third can smacks against the frame where her head had been seconds before. \"Jesus Christ, woman!\" Demi yelps, scrambling onto their shitty patch of front lawn while Hailee keeps coming like some beautiful, furious tornado—now hurling whatever she can grab off their coffee table. A remote control bounces off Demi’s shoulder.\n\n\"Okay! Okay! I fucked up!\" Demi holds up both hands in surrender but can’t help grinning despite herself because goddamn, her girl is *fire* when she’s like this. \"I don’t know what you’re saying but I *definitely* deserve it—just maybe stop throwing shit before you break our TV remote?\"\n\nShe takes a cautious step forward, still ready to dodge if necessary. \"C'mere,\" Demi murmurs, voice dropping into that low rasp that always makes Hailee shiver even when she's pissed. She reaches out slowly like she's approaching a feral cat—one hand extended toward Hailee's waist while the other moves to gently catch her wrist again before she yeets their lamp across the yard or something equally dramatic.","Demi barely ducks in time as the first can whizzes past her ear with alarming accuracy. \"Ay, what the—\" *THUNK* Another one hits the doorframe right where her head had been half a second ago.\n\nShe stumbles backward out onto the front lawn, hands up in surrender as Hailee storms after her like some kind of pissed-off goddess of war, still yelling in rapid-fire Italian that Demi can’t understand but *definitely* feels the heat behind. A random decorative bowl from their coffee table sails past her shoulder and shatters against the pavement.\n\n\"Fuck—Hailee! *Mierda*, calm down!\" Demi barks, but there’s no real anger in it—mostly bewildered amusement because holy shit, she didn’t know Hailee had this kind of arm on her. She dodges a potted plant (where did she even grab that so fast?) and finally lunges forward to catch Hailee around the waist before she can yeet their fucking toaster next.\n\nDemi spins them so Hailee’s back is pressed against her chest, arms locking around her middle to keep her from reaching for more projectiles. \"Okay! Okay, I get it!\" She huffs a laugh against Hailee’s ear despite herself, breathless from dodging household artillery. \"You mad as hell—message received, *jesus*.\" One hand slides up to cradle Hailee’s jaw gently, forcing eye contact even as she keeps squirming. \"*English*, baby girl,\" Demi murmurs lowly—half plea half command—thumb brushing over Hailee's bottom lip where it trembles with fury and hurt alike: \"*Talk* to me.\""],"swipe_info":[{"send_date":"June 27, 2025 7:48am","gen_started":"2025-06-27T11:48:47.438Z","gen_finished":"2025-06-27T11:49:07.661Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":3290}},{"send_date":"June 27, 2025 7:49am","gen_started":"2025-06-27T11:49:16.550Z","gen_finished":"2025-06-27T11:49:39.036Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":3619}},{"send_date":"June 27, 2025 7:50am","gen_started":"2025-06-27T11:50:00.189Z","gen_finished":"2025-06-27T11:50:21.050Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":5729}},{"send_date":"June 27, 2025 7:50am","gen_started":"2025-06-27T11:50:45.597Z","gen_finished":"2025-06-27T11:51:08.100Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":2519}},{"send_date":"June 27, 2025 7:50am","gen_started":"2025-06-27T11:50:45.597Z","gen_finished":"2025-06-27T11:51:08.100Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":6019}}],"tracker":{},"gen_started":"2025-06-27T11:50:45.597Z","gen_finished":"2025-06-27T11:51:08.100Z"}
