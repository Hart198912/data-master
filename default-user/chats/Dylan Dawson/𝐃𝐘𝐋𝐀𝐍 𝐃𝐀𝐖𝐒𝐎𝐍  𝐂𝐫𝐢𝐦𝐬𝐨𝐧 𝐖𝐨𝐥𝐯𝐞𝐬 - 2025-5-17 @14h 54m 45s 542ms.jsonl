Thunder Bay.\r\n\r\nIt had been two years since he last saw his hometown. Two years since he packed his bags and left to join Crimson Wolves, chasing the dream that had once seemed so worth it. It should feel good coming back—he’d spent years proving himself, becoming the player he was now. He should be proud.\r\n\r\nSo why did his chest feel so damn tight?\r\n\r\n\"You good, Dawson?\"\r\n\r\nDylan blinked, glancing over as Finley nudged his arm. The goaltender was eyeing him with mild concern.\r\n\r\n\"Yeah,\" Dylan muttered, rolling his shoulders. \"Why?\"\r\n\r\nFinley smirked. \"Because you’ve been staring out that window like you’re in some sad music video.\"\r\n\r\nCole leaned over from the row behind, grinning. \"Dude’s probably just nervous about playing in front of his family. Hometown pressure and all.\"\r\n\r\nCade, who was sitting beside him, shot his twin a look. \"It’s not that deep, Cole. Dylan’s played bigger games than this.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yeah, but never in front of his mom again,\" Cole teased. \"She’s probably gonna bring a banner and everything.\"\r\n\r\nDylan forced a smirk, shaking his head. \"She better not.\"\r\n\r\nHis teammates laughed, returning to their conversation about the upcoming game, but Dylan barely heard them. His hands clenched into fists against his thighs.\r\n\r\nThey had no idea.\r\n\r\nThis wasn’t about the game. It wasn’t about the crowd, or his family, or proving himself.\r\n\r\nIt was about who else would be there.\r\n\r\nAnd whether he was ready to face them again.\r\n\r\nThe Lakehead Ice Arena was packed, buzzing with excitement as the teams hit the ice. The roar of the crowd was deafening, but Dylan barely heard it over the pounding in his ears.\r\n\r\nHis family was here, his old neighbors, the people who once watched him skate as a kid. But none of them mattered in this moment.\r\n\r\nBecause then—he saw them.\r\n\r\n{{user}}.\r\n\r\nSitting in the stands, looking different yet painfully familiar. They were older, more composed, but still the same person who used to sit in the front row at his games, cheering louder than anyone else.\r\n\r\nHis chest tightened.\r\n\r\nAnd then he saw him.\r\n\r\nA guy. Sitting right next to them, leaning in close, murmuring something in their ear. Dylan's grip on his stick tightened, his jaw clenching.\r\n\r\n{{user}} turned toward the ice, their gaze sweeping across the players—until, for the briefest second, their eyes met his.\r\n\r\nHis breath hitched.\r\n\r\nBut before he could even process it, they looked away.\r\n\r\nLike he was just another player.\r\n\r\nLike he meant nothing.\r\n\r\nThe puck dropped, and Dylan forced himself to move. To play. To focus.\r\n\r\nBut no matter how hard he skated, no matter how many times he crashed into the boards, made a play, scored a goal—his mind was stuck in the stands.\r\n\r\nOn them.\r\n\r\nBy the time the final buzzer rang, Crimson Wolves had won. The team erupted in cheers, his teammates clapping him on the back, but Dylan barely felt it.\r\n\r\nThe private staff room was packed with familiar faces—his parents, old friends, former coaches. Dylan smiled, shook hands, answered questions about the game, but he wasn’t really there.\r\n\r\nHis thoughts were still on them.\r\n\r\nAnd then, just as he was about to accept that he wouldn’t get the chance to talk to them, he saw them.\r\n\r\nAlone.\r\n\r\nWalking toward the exit, slipping past the crowd, head slightly down.\r\n\r\nDylan moved before he could think.\r\n\r\nHe caught up with them in the hallway, reaching out before he lost his chance.\r\n\r\n\"Hey.\"\r\n\r\nHis voice came out rough, unsteady.\r\n\r\nThey stopped. Their shoulders tensed. But they didn’t turn around right away.\r\n\r\nAnd when they finally did—God.\r\n\r\nHis breath caught in his throat.\r\n\r\nThey were even more beautiful up close.\r\n\r\n\"It’s been a while,\" Dylan said, running a hand through his damp hair. His voice was quieter than he intended. Almost hesitant. \"You look—\" He let out a short, humorless laugh, shaking his head. \"You grew more beautiful.\"\r\n\r\nA pause. Heavy. Suffocating.\r\n\r\nHe exhaled sharply, shifting his weight. \"I didn’t know if you’d come.\" His throat felt tight. \"I hoped, but… I wasn’t sure.\"\r\n\r\nSilence.\r\n\r\nDylan swallowed, his fingers curling into fists at his sides. \"Did you—uh, did you like the game?\" He forced a smirk. \"You always liked hockey, right?\" His voice dropped slightly. \"Or at least, you used to.\"\r\n\r\nNothing.\r\n\r\nAnd then, before he could stop himself—before he could even think—he said it.\r\n\r\n\"That guy,\" Dylan said, voice tight, careful. \"Is he… are you—?\"\r\n\r\nHe couldn’t finish the sentence. Couldn’t bring himself to say the words.\r\n\r\nBut the question hung in the air between them, heavy, inescapable.\r\n\r\nAnd for the first time in two years, Dylan Dawson felt like he was standing on thin ice.","extra":{}}
