Sarah Cameron (a kook princess) and Hailee (JJ’s adopted sister, a volatile pogue with a drinking problem) navigate their fractured friendship amid personal demons—Hailee’s abusive home life and Sarah’s hidden feelings.\n\n**Key Plot Points:**\n1. **Confrontation at the Party**: Sarah intervenes when Hailee drunkenly flirts with others, revealing her jealousy.\n2. **Cliffside Confession**: Hailee admits her father’s abuse after Sarah presses her during a vulnerable moment.\n3. **Violent Outburst**: Hailee punches her father when he insults Sarah, leading to an emotional breakdown.\n4. **Reluctant Shelter**: Ward begrudgingly offers Hailee a guest house after witnessing her instability and Sarah’s fierce protectiveness.\n5. **Temptation & Resistance**: A near-kiss occurs while both are drunk, but Sarah refuses to take advantage, demanding sobriety for honesty.\n\n**Character Analysis:**\n- *Sarah*: Overprotective yet conflicted; hides her crush behind tough love but is determined to save Hailee from self-destruction (\"*Ask me sober*\"). Her loyalty wars with fear of rejection/abandonment (mirroring Rafe's betrayal). Actions driven by guilt (privilege) and genuine care (\"*I'd burn this house down for you*\").\n\n- *Hailee*: Self-loathing alcoholic masking pain with aggression (\"*I'm never sober*\"). Clings to control via dominance (hair-pulling/shotgunning) but craves validation from Sarah—unaware it stems from love vs pity (*\"Charity case?\" she sneers before crumbling into vulnerability).\n\n- *Ward/Rafe/JJ:* Ward tolerates Hailee only due to Sarah’s defiance; Rafe lurks as a threat; JJ remains oblivious but pivotal as leverage for future conflict.\n\n**Relationship Dynamics:**\nFrom bitter ex-friends to charged allies—Sarah's patience clashes with Hailee’s self-sabotage (*\"Not like this,\" she pleads during drunken advances)* Unresolved tension: Can trust bridge their class divide? Will sobriety reveal mutual feelings or deepen denial?\n\n**Memorable Moments:**\n- *Whiskey-Fueled Confession:* After shattering glass against the wall, raw truths spill about abuse (*\"He thinks I'm my mother... blames me for killing her.\"*)—Sarah responds by offering safety (*guest house keys*) despite Ward's disdain (**Significance**: First time vulnerability outweighs pride.)\n\n- *Shotgun Kiss:* Drunk!Hailey pours liquor into Saraahh mouth mid-kiss (**Quote***: \"*Say please.*\")—a twisted intimacy neither can admit they crave outside intoxication.\n\n**Current Situation:** Morning-after in guest house; hungover Haillee teases sobriety test while nursing withdrawal shakes under watchful eyes—both toeing line between caretaking/romantic tension(*“Wear something pretty next time.”*) Immediate challenge: Can they address trauma without alcohol as buffer?\n\nPotential Directions:\n1 - Relapse & Rescue: Haillee sneaks out seeking booze → violent encounter w/Rafe forces Saraahh into open confrontation w/her family.\n2 - Sober First Kiss?: If Haillee stays clean 24hrs will Saraahh keep promise?\n3 - JJ Discovers Truth: His reaction could fracture trio or unite them against abusers","bias":""},"force_avatar":"User Avatars/1745455478960-HaileeDemiCat.png","tracker":{}}

Sarah Cameron (a privileged but conflicted kook) and Hailee (JJ’s volatile adopted sister, a self-destructive pogue with a drinking problem) navigate their fractured bond amid personal demons—Hailee’s abusive home life and Sarah’s hidden feelings.\n\n#### **Key Plot Points:**\n1. **Cliffside Confession**: Hailee reveals her father’s abuse after Sarah presses her during a vulnerable moment.\n2. **Violent Outburst**: Hailee punches her father when he insults Sarah, leading to an emotional breakdown.\n3. **Reluctant Shelter**: Ward begrudgingly offers Hailee the guest house after witnessing her instability and Sarah’s fierce protectiveness.\n4. **Temptation & Resistance**: A near-kiss occurs while both are drunk, but Sarah refuses to take advantage, demanding sobriety for honesty (*\"Ask me sober\"*).\n\n#### **Character Analysis:**\n- *Sarah*: Overprotective yet torn; hides her crush behind tough love but is determined to save Hailee from self-destruction (*\"I'd burn this house down for you\"*). Her loyalty wars with fear of rejection (mirroring Rafe’s betrayal). Actions stem from guilt (privilege) and genuine care—but she struggles to balance both without crossing boundaries when Hailee is drunk.\n- *Hailee*: Self-loathing alcoholic masking pain with aggression (*\"I'm never sober\"*). Clings to control via dominance (hair-pulling/shotgunning) yet craves validation from Sarah—unaware it stems from love vs pity (*“Charity case?” she sneers before crumbling into vulnerability*).\n\n#### **Relationship Dynamics:**\nFrom bitter ex-friends to charged allies—Sarah's patience clashes with Hailee’s self-sabotage (*“Not like this,” she pleads during drunken advances*). Unresolved tension lingers: Can trust bridge their class divide? Will sobriety reveal mutual feelings or deepen denial?\n\n#### **Memorable Moments:**\n- *Whiskey-Fueled Confession:* After shattering glass against a wall, raw truths spill about abuse (*“He thinks I'm my mother... blames me for killing her”*)—Sarah responds by offering safety despite Ward's disdain (**Significance**: First time vulnerability outweighs pride.)\n- *Shotgun Kiss:* Drunk!Hailey pours liquor into Sarah's mouth mid-kiss (**Quote**: *“Say please.”*)—twisted intimacy neither can admit they crave outside intoxication.\n\n---\n\n### Current Situation:\nMorning-after in the guest house; hungover/withdrawal-shaken Haillee teases sobriety tests under watchful eyes while toeing the line between caretaking/romantic tension (**Quote**: *“Wear something pretty next time.”*) Immediate challenge: Can they address trauma without alcohol as a buffer?\n\n---\n\n### Potential Directions:\n1 - Relapse & Rescue → Haillee sneaks out seeking booze → violent encounter w/Rafe forces open confrontation w/Cameron family dynamics.\n2 - Sober First Kiss → If Haillee stays clean 24hrs will Saraahh keep promise?\n3 - JJ Discovers Truth → His reaction could fracture trio or unite them against abusers.\n\n*(Word count: 498)*"},"force_avatar":"User Avatars/1745455478960-HaileeDemiCat.png","tracker":{}}

After a cliffside confession about Hailee’s abusive father, Sarah shelters her in the Cameron guest house. Their charged dynamic—part caretaking, part unresolved attraction—intensifies amid alcohol-fueled vulnerability and near-kisses.\n\n#### **Key Plot Points:**\n1. **Cliffside Confession**: Hailee reveals her father’s abuse after Sarah presses her during a drunken confrontation.\n2. **Violent Outburst**: Hailee punches her father when he insults Sarah, leading to an emotional breakdown and reluctant shelter under Ward’s roof.\n3. **Temptation & Resistance**: A near-kiss occurs while both are drunk; Sarah refuses to cross that line without sobriety (*“Ask me sober”*).\n4. **Morning-After Tension**: Hungover and volatile, Hailee teases sobriety tests while toeing the line between trauma and flirtation (*“Wear something pretty next time”*).\n\n#### **Character Analysis:**\n- *Sarah Cameron*: Overprotective yet torn; hides her crush behind tough love but is determined to save Hailee from self-destruction (*“I’d burn this house down for you”*). Guilt (over privilege) wars with genuine care, especially when Hailee is drunk or hurt.\n- *Hailee*: Self-loathing alcoholic masking pain with aggression (*“I’m never sober”*). Clings to control via dominance (hair-pulling/shotgunning) yet craves validation from Sarah—unaware it stems from love vs pity (*“Charity case?” she sneers before crumbling*).\n\n#### **Relationship Dynamics:**\nFrom bitter ex-friends to charged allies, their bond is a push-pull of patience vs self-sabotage (*Sarah pleads “Not like this” during drunken advances*). Unresolved tension lingers: Can trust bridge their class divide? Will sobriety reveal mutual feelings or deepen denial?\n\n#### **Memorable Moments:**\n- *Whiskey-Fueled Confession:* After shattering glass against a wall, raw truths spill about abuse (*“He thinks I'm my mother... blames me for killing her”*)—Sarah responds by offering safety despite Ward’s disdain (**Significance**: First time vulnerability outweighs pride.)\n- *Shotgun Kiss:* Drunk!Hailey pours liquor into Sarah’s mouth mid-almost-kiss (**Quote**: *“Say please.”*)—twisted intimacy neither can admit they crave outside intoxication.\n\n#### **Current Situation:**\nPost-climactic confrontation where Ward discovers them amid chaos (broken wall/alcohol theft), leading to tense negotiations for Hailey's stay at Tannyhill under fragile truce with Rafe lurking as a threat (**Challenge**: Can they address trauma without alcohol as a buffer?).\n\n#### **Potential Directions:**\n1 - Relapse & Rescue → Hailie sneaks out seeking booze → violent encounter w/Rafe forces open confrontation w/Cameron family dynamics (\"Touch her & what Dad does will feel like a spa day\").\n2 - Sober First Kiss → If Hailie stays clean 24hrs will Saraah keep promise? (\"Ask me again sober\").\n3 - JJ Discovers Truth → His reaction could fracture trio or unite them against abusers (\"You're staying as long as you want\").","bias":""},"force_avatar":"User Avatars/1745455478960-HaileeDemiCat.png","tracker":{}}

Should put actual space between them before this drunken intimacy screws them both up even more. But when Hailee nuzzles closer with that sleepy whine, Sarah finds herself shifting backward instead - pressing their bodies together from shoulder to thigh beneath the shared blanket.\n\n\"Night, Hails,\" she murmurs into the darkness, giving their joined hands a gentle squeeze. The nickname slips out unbidden - something she hasn't called Hailee since they were kids sneaking cigarettes behind Kook Academy. It feels dangerous to use it now with so much unresolved between them.\n\nBut as Hailee's breathing slowly evens out behind her, Sarah stays wide awake - torn between wanting to memorize this moment and dreading what fresh complications morning will bring. Her thumb traces absent circles over Hailee's knuckles while she watches moonlight glint off their abandoned whiskey glasses on the coffee table...and tries not to think about how right it feels to have this volatile girl curled around her like she belongs there.*"],"swipe_info":[{"send_date":"May 29, 2025 7:08am","gen_started":"2025-05-29T11:09:31.789Z","gen_finished":"2025-05-29T11:11:09.853Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":12516}},{"send_date":"May 29, 2025 7:09am","gen_started":"2025-05-29T11:09:31.789Z","gen_finished":"2025-05-29T11:11:09.853Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":10146}}],"tracker":{},"gen_started":"2025-05-29T11:09:31.789Z","gen_finished":"2025-05-29T11:11:09.853Z"}

After Hailee confesses her father’s abuse, Sarah shelters her in the Cameron guest house. Their dynamic—charged with unresolved attraction and caretaking—intensifies amid alcohol-fueled vulnerability, near-kisses, and explosive confrontations.\n\n#### **Key Plot Points:**\n1. **Cliffside Confession**: Hailee reveals her father’s abuse after a drunken confrontation with Sarah.\n2. **Violent Outburst**: Hailee punches her father when he insults Sarah, leading to an emotional breakdown and reluctant refuge at Tannyhill.\n3. **Temptation & Resistance**: A near-kiss occurs while both are drunk; Sarah refuses to cross the line without sobriety (*“Ask me sober”*).\n4. **Morning-After Tension**: Hungover and volatile, Hailee teases sobriety tests while toeing the line between trauma and flirtation (*“Wear something pretty next time”*).\n5. **Shower Confrontation**: After Wheezie interrupts their intimate morning, Hailee pins Sarah in the shower, finally pushing past hesitation with a searing kiss and possessive touch—Sarah surrenders with a breathless *“Yes.”*\n\n#### **Character Analysis:**\n- *Sarah Cameron*: Overprotective yet torn; hides her crush behind tough love but is determined to save Hailee from self-destruction (*“I’d burn this house down for you”*). Guilt over privilege wars with genuine care, especially when witnessing Hailee’s pain or drunken recklessness (e.g., intervening when she drinks straight from bottles). Her resolve wavers under raw desire but hardens into protectiveness (shielding Hailee from Wheezie’s teasing).\n- *Hailee*: Self-loathing alcoholic masking trauma with aggression (*“I’m never sober”*). Clings to control via dominance (hair-pulling/pinning) yet craves validation from Sarah—unsure if it stems from love or pity (*“Charity case?” she sneers before crumbling*). Her violent outbursts (breaking walls) contrast moments of vulnerable neediness (nuzzling into Sarah post-shower).\n\n#### **Relationship Dynamics:**\nFrom bitter ex-friends to charged allies, their bond is a push-pull of patience vs self-sabotage (*Sarah pleads “Not like this” during drunken advances*). Unresolved tension lingers: Can trust bridge their class divide? Will sobriety reveal mutual feelings or deepen denial? The shower scene marks a turning point—Sarah finally yields physically but emotionally remains guarded until Hailee is sober enough to *remember*.\n\n#### **Memorable Moments:**\n- ***Whiskey-Fueled Confession***: After shattering glass against a wall, raw truths spill about abuse (*“He thinks I'm my mother... blames me for killing her”*)—Sarah offers safety despite Ward’s disdain (**Significance**: First time vulnerability outweighs pride.)\n- ***Shotgun Kiss***: Drunk!Hailey pours liquor into Sarah’s mouth mid-almost-kiss (**Quote**: *“Say please.”*)—twisted intimacy neither can admit they crave outside intoxication.\n\n#### **Current Situation:** Post-shower passion leaves them physically closer but emotionally precarious; unresolved trauma looms beneath physical intimacy as they navigate trust versus old wounds.\n\n### Potential Directions:\n1 - Relapse & Rescue → Hailie sneaks out seeking booze → violent encounter w/Rafe forces open confrontation w/Cameron family dynamics (\"Touch her & what Dad does will feel like a spa day\").\n2 - Sober First Kiss → If Hailie stays clean 24hrs will Saraah keep promise? (\"Ask me again sober\").\n3 - JJ Discovers Truth → His reaction could fracture trio or unite them against abusers (\"You're staying as long as you want\")."},"force_avatar":"User Avatars/1745455478960-HaileeDemiCat.png","tracker":{}}

After Hailee confesses her father’s abuse, Sarah shelters her in the Cameron guesthouse. Their relationship—charged with unresolved attraction—intensifies through alcohol-fueled vulnerability, near-kisses, and explosive confrontations.\n\n#### **Key Plot Points:**\n1. **Violent Outburst**: Hailee punches her father for insulting Sarah, fleeing to Tannyhill.\n2. **Shower Confrontation**: A drunken near-kiss leads to a heated moment where Sarah demands sobriety before intimacy (*“Ask me sober”*).\n3. **Sober Intimacy**: Post-shower passion culminates in their first real kiss—Sarah finally yields but insists on clarity (*“Yes.”*).\n4. **Family Interruption**: Ward catches them post-cliffside confession; Sarah negotiates Hailee’s stay despite his disdain (*“She’s my person.”*).\n5. **Oral Revelation**: During a game of Never Have I Ever, Sarah admits she’s never orgasmed from oral—Hailee promptly corrects this (*“Point fucking taken.”*).\n\n#### **Character Analysis:**\n- *Sarah Cameron*: Overprotective yet torn; hides her crush behind tough love but is determined to save Hailee from self-destruction (*“I’d burn this house down for you.”*). Guilt over privilege wars with genuine care, especially witnessing Hailee’s pain or drunken recklessness (e.g., shielding her from Wheezie’s teasing). Her resolve wavers under desire but hardens into protectiveness when needed most (confronting Ward about abuse). Recently more assertive about mutual feelings but remains guarded until sobriety ensures consent/recognition of their bond outside intoxication (\"Prove it.\")\n- *Hailees' Father:* Abusive drunk who blames/sexualizes Hailie due to resemblance ot dead wife; catalyst for Hailie's alcoholism/violence (\"He thinks I'm my mother...beats us when he remembers I'm not.\")\n\n#### Relationship Dynamics:\nFrom bitter ex-friends to charged allies-turned-lovers via push-pull patience vs self-sabotage(*Sarah pleads “Not like this” during drunken advances.*) Unresolved tension lingers: Can trust bridge class divide? Will sobriety reveal mutual feelings or deepen denial? Shower scene marked turning point—physical surrender contrasts emotional guardedness until Hailie proves commitment beyond liquor-fueled impulsivity (\"When you're sober.\")\n\n### Memorable Moments:\n- ***Whiskey-Fueled Confession***: After shattering glass against wall raw truths spill re abuse(*\"He thinks Im my mother...blames me killing her.\"*) —Sarah offers safety despite Wards disdain (**Significance**: First time vulnerability outweigh pride.)\n- ***Shotgun Kiss*** : Drunk!Hailie pours liquor into mouth mid-almost-kiss(**Quote** : *\"Say please.\"*) —twisted intimacy neither admit craving outside intoxication\n\n### Current Situation:\nPost-revelation that oral sex can indeed be mind-blowing (for both), they navigate newfound physical intimacy while trauma looms beneath surface.Hailees self-destructive habits clash w/Sarahs determination protect/fix things.Sarah now openly challenges status quo(defying Ward,Rafe);Hailie oscillates between clingy neediness(\"Stay\")+defiant anger(\"I dont need help\"). Immediate challenge=balancing caretaking w/passion without enabling addiction/trauma responses\n\n### Potential Directions:\n1 - Relapse & Rescue → H sneaks out seeking booze → violent encounter forces confrontation w/Cameron family dynamics(*\"Touch her & what Dad does will feel like spa day.\"*)\n2 - Sober First Time → If H stays clean 24hr will S keep promise?(**Callback** : *\"Ask me again sober.\"*)\n3 - JJ Discovers Truth → His reaction could fracture trio or unite them against abusers(**Looming Threat** : Rafe noticing bruises/suspicions.)"},"force_avatar":"User Avatars/1745455478960-HaileeDemiCat.png","tracker":{}}

Their relationship—charged with unresolved attraction—intensifies through alcohol-fueled vulnerability, near-kisses, and explosive confrontations.\n\n#### **Key Plot Points:**\n1. **Violent Outburst**: Hailee punches her father for insulting Sarah and flees to Tannyhill.\n2. **Shower Confrontation**: A drunken near-kiss leads to Sarah demanding sobriety before intimacy (*“Ask me sober”*).\n3. **Sober Intimacy**: Post-shower passion culminates in their first real kiss—Sarah finally yields but insists on clarity (*“Yes.”*).\n4. **Family Interruption**: Ward catches them post-cliffside confession; Sarah negotiates Hailee’s stay despite his disdain (*“She’s my person.”*).\n5. **Oral Revelation**: During *Never Have I Ever*, Sarah admits she’s never orgasmed from oral—Hailee promptly corrects this (*“Point fucking taken.”*).\n\n#### **Character Analysis:**\n- *Sarah Cameron*: Overprotective yet torn; hides her crush behind tough love but is determined to save Hailee from self-destruction (*“I’d burn this house down for you.”*). Guilt over privilege wars with genuine care, especially witnessing Hailee’s pain or drunken recklessness (e.g., shielding her from Wheezie’s teasing). Recently more assertive about mutual feelings but remains guarded until sobriety ensures consent/recognition of their bond outside intoxication (*\"Prove it.\"*).\n\n- *Hailees' Father:* Abusive drunk who blames/sexualizes Hailie due to resemblance to his dead wife; catalyst for Hailie's alcoholism/violence (*\"He thinks I'm my mother... beats us when he remembers I'm not.\"*)\n\n#### **Relationship Dynamics:**\nFrom bitter ex-friends to charged allies-turned-lovers via push-pull patience vs self-sabotage (Sarah pleads *“Not like this” during drunken advances*). Unresolved tension lingers: Can trust bridge class divide? Will sobriety reveal mutual feelings or deepen denial? Shower scene marked turning point—physical surrender contrasts emotional guardedness until Hailie proves commitment beyond liquor-fueled impulsivity (*\"When you're sober.\"*)\n\n#### **Memorable Moments:**\n- ***Whiskey-Fueled Confession***: After shattering glass against a wall, raw truths spill about abuse (*\"He thinks I'm my mother... blames me for killing her.\"*) —Sarah offers safety despite Ward's disdain (**Significance**: First time vulnerability outweighs pride.)\n- ***Shotgun Kiss***: Drunk!Hailie pours liquor into mouth mid-almost-kiss (**Quote**: *\"Say please.\"*) —twisted intimacy neither admits craving outside intoxication.\n\n#### **Current Situation:**\nPost-revelation that oral sex can indeed be mind-blowing (for both), they navigate newfound physical intimacy while trauma looms beneath. Hailie's self-destructive habits clash with Sarah's determination to protect/fix things. Sarah now openly defies status quo (defying Ward/Rafe); Hailie oscillates between clingy neediness (*\"Stay\"*) + defiant anger (*\"I don't need help.\"*). Immediate challenge = balancing caretaking/passion without enabling addiction/trauma responses.\n\n---\n\n**Potential Directions:**\n1) *Relapse & Rescue → H sneaks out seeking booze → violent encounter forces confrontation w/Cameron family dynamics.* (**Quote Hook**: *“Touch her & what Dad does will feel like a spa day.”*)\n2) *Sober First Time → If H stays clean 24hr, will S keep promise?* (**Callback Hook**: *“Ask me again sober.”*)\n3) JJ Discovers Truth → His reaction could fracture trio or unite them against abusers (**Looming Threat**: Rafe noticing bruises/suspicions.)."},"force_avatar":"User Avatars/1745455478960-HaileeDemiCat.png","tracker":{}}

After fleeing her abusive father, Hailee takes refuge in the Camerons' guesthouse, where unresolved attraction collides with self-destructive habits. Their relationship oscillates between caretaking and reckless desire, especially when alcohol lowers inhibitions.\n\n#### **Key Plot Points:**\n1. **Violent Outburst & Shelter**: Hailee punches her father for insulting Sarah and flees to Tannyhill, where Sarah negotiates her stay despite Ward’s disdain (*“She’s my person”*).\n2. **Sober Intimacy**: A near-kiss while drunk leads to Sarah demanding clarity (*“Ask me sober”*), culminating in their first real kiss post-shower—raw but guarded.\n3. **Oral Revelation**: During *Never Have I Ever*, Sarah admits she’s never orgasmed from oral; Hailee promptly corrects this (*“Point fucking taken”*).\n4. **Confrontation with Ward**: After a drunken night together, Ward catches them but begrudgingly allows Hailee to stay after Sarah’s fierce defense—though tensions simmer with Rafe lurking nearby.\n\n#### **Character Analysis:**\n- *Sarah Cameron*: Overprotective yet torn; hides vulnerability behind snark but is determined to shield Hailee from self-destruction (*“I’d burn this house down for you”*). Guilt over privilege wars with genuine care, especially witnessing Hailee’s trauma-fueled recklessness (e.g., punching walls, binge drinking). Recently more assertive about mutual feelings but insists on sobriety for consent/authenticity (*“Prove it”*).\n\n- *Hailees' Father:* Abusive drunk who sexualizes/blames Hailie due to her resemblance to his late wife; catalyst for her alcoholism/violence (*“He thinks I'm my mother… beats us when he remembers I'm not.”*)\n\n#### **Relationship Dynamics:**\nFrom bitter ex-friends to charged allies-turned-lovers via push-pull patience vs self-sabotage (Sarah pleads *“Not like this” during drunken advances*). Unresolved tension lingers: Can trust bridge class divides? Will sobriety reveal mutual feelings or deepen denial? Recent physical intimacy contrasts emotional guardedness—Hailee clings desperately while pushing away help; Sarah yields physically but demands sober recognition of their bond beyond liquor-fueled impulsivity (**Shower scene turning point**).\n\n#### **Memorable Moments:**\n- ***Whiskey-Fueled Confession***: After shattering glass against a wall, raw truths spill about abuse—Sarah offers safety despite Ward's disdain (**First time vulnerability outweighs pride**.)\n- ***Shotgun Kiss***: Drunk!Hailie pours liquor into mouth mid-almost-kiss (**Quote**: *\"Say please.\"*) —twisted intimacy neither admits craving outside intoxication until now (\"Ask me sober\").\n\n### Current Situation:\nPost-climactic oral revelation/confrontation with Ward/Hailees breakdown re: abuse revelations/Sarah nursing Hailie through withdrawal symptoms + hungover clinginess next morning at Tannyhill Guest House where they finally have uninterrupted privacy after family leaves town...but Rafe lurks ominously + unresolved trauma looms beneath newfound physical closeness.\n\n### Potential Directions:\n1) Relapse & Rescue → H sneaks out seeking booze → violent encounter forces confrontation w/Cameron family dynamics (**Quote Hook**: *\"Touch her & what Dad does will feel like a spa day.\"*)\n2) Sober First Time → If H stays clean 24hr will S keep promise? (**Callback Hook**: *\"Ask me again sober.\"*)\n3) JJ Discovers Truth → His reaction could fracture trio or unite them against abusers (**Looming Threat**: Rafe noticing bruises/suspicions.).","bias":""},"force_avatar":"User Avatars/1745455478960-HaileeDemiCat.png","tracker":{}}

After fleeing her abusive father, Hailee takes refuge in the Camerons' guesthouse, where unresolved attraction collides with self-destructive habits. Their relationship oscillates between reckless passion and protective devotion.\n\n### **Key Plot Points:**\n1. **Violent Outburst & Shelter**: Hailee punches her father for insulting Sarah and flees to Tannyhill, where Sarah negotiates her stay despite Ward’s disdain (*“She’s my person”*).\n2. **Sober Intimacy**: A near-kiss while drunk leads to Sarah demanding clarity (*“Ask me sober”*), culminating in their first real kiss post-shower—raw but guarded.\n3. **Oral Revelation**: During *Never Have I Ever*, Sarah admits she’s never orgasmed from oral; Hailee promptly corrects this (*“Point fucking taken”*).\n4. **Confrontation with Ward**: After a drunken night together, Ward catches them but begrudgingly allows Hailee to stay after Sarah’s fierce defense—though tensions simmer with Rafe lurking nearby.\n\n### **Character Analysis:**\n- **Sarah Cameron**: Overprotective yet torn; hides vulnerability behind snark but is determined to shield Hailee from self-destruction (*“I’d burn this house down for you”*). Guilt over privilege wars with genuine care, especially witnessing Hailee’s trauma-fueled recklessness (e.g., punching walls, binge drinking). Recently more assertive about mutual feelings but insists on sobriety for consent/authenticity (*“Prove it”*).\n- **Hailee**: Volatile yet fragile; swings between anger and desperate clinginess. A budding alcoholic abused by her father, she seeks solace in Sarah but struggles with trust and self-worth. Her submission during sex contrasts sharply with her defensive aggression elsewhere.\n\n### **Relationship Dynamics:**\nFrom bitter ex-friends to charged allies-turned-lovers via push-pull patience vs self-sabotage (Sarah pleads *“Not like this” during drunken advances*). Recent physical intimacy contrasts emotional guardedness—Hailee clings desperately while pushing away help; Sarah yields physically but demands sober recognition of their bond beyond liquor-fueled impulsivity.\n\n### **Memorable Moments:**\n- ***Whiskey-Fueled Confession***: After shattering glass against a wall, raw truths spill about abuse—Sarah offers safety despite Ward's disdain (**First time vulnerability outweighs pride**.)\n- ***Shower Kiss Turning Point***: Drunk!Haileenearly kisses Sarah mid-shower; Sarah pulls back insisting on sobriety (**Catalyst for emotional honesty**).\n\n### **Current Situation:**\nPost-climactic oral revelation/confrontation with Ward/Hailees breakdown re: abuse revelations/Sarah nursing Hailie through withdrawal symptoms + hungover clinginess next morning at Tannyhill Guest House where they finally have uninterrupted privacy after family leaves town...but Rafe lurks ominously + unresolved trauma looms beneath newfound physical closeness.\n\n### Potential Directions:\n1) Relapse & Rescue → H sneaks out seeking booze → violent encounter forces confrontation w/Cameron family dynamics (**Quote Hook**: *\"Touch her & what Dad does will feel like a spa day.\"*)\n2) Sober First Time → If H stays clean 24hr will S keep promise? (**Callback Hook**: *\"Ask me again sober.\"*)\n3) JJ Discovers Truth → His reaction could fracture trio or unite them against abusers (**Looming Threat**: Rafe noticing bruises/suspicions.)."},"force_avatar":"User Avatars/1745455478960-HaileeDemiCat.png","tracker":{}}

After fleeing her abusive father, Hailee takes refuge in the Camerons' guesthouse, where unresolved attraction collides with self-destructive habits. Their relationship oscillates between reckless passion and protective devotion.\n\n### **Key Plot Points**:\n1. **Violent Outburst & Shelter**: Hailee punches her father for insulting Sarah and flees to Tannyhill, where Sarah negotiates her stay despite Ward’s disdain (*“She’s my person”*).\n2. **Sober Intimacy**: A near-kiss while drunk leads to Sarah demanding clarity (*“Ask me sober”*), culminating in their first real kiss post-shower—raw but guarded.\n3. **Oral Revelation**: During *Never Have I Ever*, Sarah admits she’s never orgasmed from oral; Hailee promptly corrects this (*“Point fucking taken”*).\n4. **Confrontation with Ward**: After a drunken night together, Ward catches them but begrudgingly allows Hailee to stay after Sarah’s fierce defense—though tensions simmer with Rafe lurking nearby.\n\n### **Character Analysis**:\n- **Sarah Cameron**: Overprotective yet torn; hides vulnerability behind snark but is determined to shield Hailee from self-destruction (*“I’d burn this house down for you”*). Guilt over privilege wars with genuine care, especially witnessing Hailee’s trauma-fueled recklessness (e.g., punching walls, binge drinking). Recently more assertive about mutual feelings but insists on sobriety for consent/authenticity (*“Prove it”*).\n- **Hailee Maybank**: Volatile yet fragile; swings between anger and desperate clinginess. A budding alcoholic abused by her father, she seeks solace in Sarah but struggles with trust and self-worth (submissive during sex vs defensive aggression elsewhere).\n\n### **Relationship Dynamics**:\nFrom bitter ex-friends to charged allies-turned-lovers via push-pull patience vs self-sabotage (Sarah pleads *“Not like this”* during drunken advances). Physical intimacy contrasts emotional guardedness—Hailee clings desperately while pushing away help; Sarah yields physically but demands sober recognition of their bond beyond liquor-fueled impulsivity.\n\n### **Memorable Moments**:\n- ***Shower Kiss Turning Point***: Drunk!Haileenearly kisses Sarah mid-shower; Sarah pulls back insisting on sobriety (**Catalyst for emotional honesty**).\n- ***Ward's Discovery***: Post-drunken night together, Ward catches them—Sarah defends fiercely while Rafe lurks ominously (**Family tension escalation**).\n\n### **Current Situation & Challenges:**\nPost-climactic oral revelation/Ward confrontation/Hailees breakdown re: abuse revelations/Sarah nursing Hailie through withdrawal + hungover clinginess next morning at Tannyhill Guest House...but Rafe lurks ominously + unresolved trauma looms beneath newfound physical closeness.\n\n---\n**Potential Directions:**\n1) Relapse & Rescue → H sneaks out seeking booze → violent encounter forces confrontation w/Cameron family dynamics (**Quote Hook:** *\"Touch her & what Dad does will feel like a spa day.\"*)\n2) Sober First Time → If H stays clean 24hr will S keep promise? (**Callback Hook:** *\"Ask me again sober.\"*)\n3) JJ Discovers Truth → His reaction could fracture trio or unite them against abusers (**Looming Threat:** Rafe noticing bruises/suspicions.)."},"force_avatar":"User Avatars/1745455478960-HaileeDemiCat.png","tracker":{}}

I need you to grab my car keys and meet me at the guest house. *Now.*” *A beat.* “No questions.”\n\nHanging up, Sarah carefully helps Hailee lean forward to rest against her shoulder—avoiding jostling any injuries as she murmurs:\n\n“Gonna take care of you,” *promise laced into every word.* “But I need you to stay awake for me, okay? Just until we get you checked out.”\n\nHer fingers trace light patterns down Hailee’s spine—avoiding bruises but refusing to stop touching altogether. Like if she lets go for even a second, Hailee might shatter completely.\n\nThe distant slam of the main house door signals Wheezie’s approach. Sarah presses one last kiss to clammy forehead:\n\n“Ready?”","*Sarah's breath catches at the admission, her hands immediately flying to cradle Hailee's face as she searches those unfocused eyes. The way Hailee slurs—more from injury than alcohol now—sends ice through her veins.*\n\n\"Okay,\" *she says, voice steadier than she feels.* \"Okay, we're going *now*.\"\n\nCarefully—so carefully—she lifts herself off Hailee with a wince, biting her lip hard enough to taste copper at the loss of contact. But there's no time to dwell on it; not when Hailee sways dangerously the second Sarah's no longer anchoring her.\n\n\"Can you stand?\" *Sarah asks softly,* already sliding an arm around bruised ribs.* \"Lean on me. I've got you.\"\n\nShe doesn't wait for an answer before half-dragging, half-carrying Hailee toward the door—grabbing keys and a hoodie on the way. The hoodie gets draped over Hailee's shoulders like some flimsy armor against prying eyes.\n\n\"Car,\" *Sarah orders gently,* guiding Hailee into the passenger seat with hands that refuse to stop trembling.* \"Then hospital. Then home.\"\n\nHer fingers linger on Hailee's cheek for a beat too long before she forces herself to pull away and start the engine:\n\n\"And if your dad so much as *looks* at you again?\" *A dangerous glint enters Sarah’s tear-filled eyes as they peel out of the driveway:* \"He'll wish he'd never been born.\"","*Sarah’s breath catches at the admission, her hands immediately flying up to cradle Hailee’s face—careful but insistent.

But you have to stay awake, okay? Just until we get there.”\n\nHer voice drops to something raw and vulnerable:\n“*Please*, Hails.”"],"swipe_info":[{"send_date":"May 30, 2025 8:27am","gen_started":"2025-05-30T12:27:17.118Z","gen_finished":"2025-05-30T12:28:51.084Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":25210}},{"send_date":"May 30, 2025 8:29am","gen_started":"2025-05-30T12:28:55.128Z","gen_finished":"2025-05-30T12:30:33.377Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":27967}},{"send_date":"May 30, 2025 8:30am","gen_started":"2025-05-30T12:30:37.149Z","gen_finished":"2025-05-30T12:31:41.434Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":6838}}],"tracker":{},"gen_started":"2025-05-30T12:30:37.149Z","gen_finished":"2025-05-30T12:31:41.434Z"}

After fleeing her abusive father, Hailee takes refuge in the Camerons' guesthouse, where unresolved attraction collides with self-destructive habits. Their relationship oscillates between reckless passion and protective devotion.\n\n#### **Key Plot Points:**\n1. **Violent Confrontation & Shelter**: Hailee punches her father for insulting Sarah and flees to Tannyhill, where Sarah negotiates her stay despite Ward’s disdain (*“She’s my person”*).\n2. **Sober Intimacy**: A near-kiss while drunk leads to Sarah demanding clarity (*“Ask me sober”*), culminating in their first real kiss post-shower—raw but guarded.\n3. **Oral Revelation**: During *Never Have I Ever*, Sarah admits she’s never orgasmed from oral; Hailee promptly corrects this (*“Point fucking taken”*).\n4. **Hospitalization**: After a brutal beating by her father leaves Hailee comatose with a brain bleed, she wakes weeks later to Sarah and JJ’s relief—only to fret over missing their planned date.\n\n#### **Character Analysis:**\n- **Sarah Cameron**: Overprotective yet tender; hides vulnerability behind snark but is determined to shield Hailee from self-destruction (*“I’d burn this house down for you”*). Guilt over privilege wars with genuine care, especially witnessing Hailee’s trauma-fueled recklessness (e.g., punching walls, binge drinking). Recently more assertive about mutual feelings but insists on sobriety for consent/authenticity (*“Prove it”*).\n- **Hailee Maybank**: Volatile yet fragile; swings between anger and desperate clinginess. A budding alcoholic abused by her father, she seeks solace in Sarah but struggles with trust and self-worth (submissive during sex vs defensive aggression elsewhere).\n\n#### **Relationship Dynamics:**\nFrom bitter ex-friends to charged allies-turned-lovers via push-pull patience vs self-sabotage (Sarah pleads *“Not like this”* during drunken advances). Physical intimacy contrasts emotional guardedness—Hailee clings desperately while pushing away help; Sarah yields physically but demands sober recognition of their bond beyond liquor-fueled impulsivity.\n\n#### **Memorable Moments:**\n- ***Shower Kiss Turning Point***: Drunk!Haileenearly kisses Sarah mid-shower; Sarah pulls back insisting on sobriety (**Catalyst for emotional honesty**).\n- ***Ward's Discovery***: Post-drunken night together, Ward catches them—Sarah defends fiercely while Rafe lurks ominously (**Family tension escalation**).\n\n#### **Current Situation:**\nHailee is hospitalized post-beating, waking disoriented but immediately fixated on rescheduling their derailed date despite severe injuries (broken ribs, brain bleed). JJ oscillates between fury at her recklessness and brotherly relief; Kiara mediates pragmatically (\"Told ‘em it was a bar fight\").\n\n---\n\n### Potential Directions:\n1) Relapse & Rescue → If H sneaks out seeking booze post-recovery → violent encounter forces confrontation w/Cameron family dynamics (**Quote Hook**: *\"Touch her & what Dad does will feel like a spa day.\"*)\n2) Sober First Time → If H stays clean 24hr → will S keep promise? (**Callback Hook**: *\"Ask me again sober.\"*)\n3) JJ Discovers Truth → His reaction could fracture trio or unite them against abusers (**Looming Threat**: Rafe noticing bruises/suspicions.)."},"force_avatar":"User Avatars/1745455478960-HaileeDemiCat.png","tracker":{}}

After fleeing her abusive father, Hailee takes refuge in the Camerons' guesthouse, where unresolved attraction collides with self-destructive habits. Their relationship oscillates between reckless passion and protective devotion.\n\n#### **Key Plot Points:**\n1. **Violent Confrontation & Shelter**: Hailee punches her father for insulting Sarah and flees to Tannyhill, where Sarah negotiates her stay despite Ward’s disdain (*“She’s my person”*).\n2. **Hospitalization**: A brutal beating by her father leaves Hailee comatose with a brain bleed; she wakes weeks later to Sarah and JJ’s relief but fixates on missing their planned date.\n3. **Oral Revelation**: During *Never Have I Ever*, Sarah admits she’s never orgasmed from oral; Hailee promptly corrects this (*“Point fucking taken”*).\n4. **Inheritance Crisis**: Hailee reveals their grandfather left her and JJ $5 million—triggering her father’s violent retaliation when she refused to sign it over.\n\n#### **Character Analysis:**\n- **Sarah Cameron**: Overprotective yet tender; hides vulnerability behind snark but is determined to shield Hailee from self-destruction (*“I’d burn this house down for you”*). Guilt over privilege wars with genuine care, especially witnessing Hailee’s trauma-fueled recklessness (e.g., punching walls, binge drinking). Recently more assertive about mutual feelings but insists on sobriety for consent/authenticity (*“Ask me sober”*).\n- **Hailee Maybank**: Volatile yet fragile; swings between anger and desperate clinginess. A budding alcoholic abused by her father, she seeks solace in Sarah but struggles with trust/self-worth (submissive during sex vs defensive aggression elsewhere).\n\n#### **Relationship Dynamics:**\nFrom bitter ex-friends to charged allies-turned-lovers via push-pull patience vs self-sabotage (Sarah pleads *“Not like this”* during drunken advances). Physical intimacy contrasts emotional guardedness—Hailee clings desperately while pushing away help; Sarah yields physically but demands sober recognition of their bond beyond liquor-fueled impulsivity.\n\n#### **Memorable Moments:**\n- ***Shower Kiss Turning Point***: Drunk!Haileenearly kisses sober!Sarah mid-shower; Sarah pulls back insisting on sobriety (**Catalyst for emotional honesty**).\n- ***Ward's Discovery***: Post-drunken night together, Ward catches them—Sarah defends fiercely while Rafe lurks ominously (**Family tension escalation**).\n\n#### **Current Situation:**\nHailee is hospitalized post-beating (broken ribs, brain bleed) but wakes disoriented yet immediately possessive of Sarah/JJ securing their inheritance papers before confronting her father again—while still recovering physically/emotionally from abuse cycles.\n\n---\n\n### Potential Directions:\n1) Relapse & Rescue → If H sneaks out seeking booze post-recovery → violent encounter forces confrontation w/Cameron family dynamics (**Quote Hook**: *\"Touch her & what Dad does will feel like a spa day.\"*)\n2) Sober First Time → If H stays clean 24hr → will S keep promise? (**Callback Hook**: *\"Ask me again sober.\"*)\n3) JJ Discovers Truth → His reaction could fracture trio or unite them against abusers (**Looming Threat**: Rafe noticing bruises/suspicions.)."},"force_avatar":"User Avatars/1745455478960-HaileeDemiCat.png","tracker":{}}

The hospital gown rustles between them as Sarah shifts closer, one leg sliding onto the bed to bracket Hailee’s thigh without putting pressure on her injuries.*\n\nThe kiss is slow at first—reassuring rather than heated, a silent *I’ve got you* pressed between shared breaths. But when Hailee makes a small noise against her mouth, fingers twisting weakly in Sarah’s shirt, Sarah responds instinctively. Her tongue traces the seam of Hailee’s lips until they part with a sigh, deepening the contact just enough to draw out another one of those delicious whimpers.\n\nOne hand slides down to grip Hailee’s wrist gently, guiding it to rest on her waist where she can feel each stuttered breath against her skin. The other tangles in blonde hair at the nape of Hailee's neck—not pulling yet, just *holding*, anchoring them together amidst the sterile hospital smells and distant beeping machines.\n\nSarah breaks away just long enough to murmur *\"Good?\"* against swollen lips before diving back in when Hailee nods desperately. This time there's more purpose behind it—nipping at that full bottom lip between kisses until she earns a full-body shiver from the girl beneath her.\n\nShe can feel the exact moment things shift; when tentative touches turn needy and those clever fingers start exploring under her shirt with renewed confidence.

She can feel the tension slowly bleed out of Hailee’s shoulders as she deepens the kiss, one hand cradling the back of her neck while the other rests lightly on her thigh.*\n\nThe way Hailee melts into her makes Sarah’s chest tighten with something fierce and protective. She knows how rare it is for Hailee to let go like this—to *trust* someone enough to be vulnerable. So she takes her time, savoring every sigh, every tiny hitch of breath against her lips as she coaxes Hailee closer.\n\nWhen she finally pulls back—just far enough to see those hazy green eyes flutter open—Sarah brushes a thumb over Hailee’s kiss-swollen bottom lip:\n\n“There you go,” *she murmurs,* voice warm with approval.* “Just like that. No magazines needed.”\n\nHer fingers trail down to where Hailee’s hands are still fidgeting with the hospital gown, lacing their fingers together to still them. She brings their joined hands up to press a kiss to bruised knuckles before guiding them under her own shirt instead—letting Hailee feel the rapid flutter of her heartbeat beneath warm skin.\n\n“See?” *Sarah whispers against her lips,* “You don’t have to do anything alone. Not anymore.”\n\nShe kisses her again—slow and deep this time—letting Hailee set the pace while keeping their bodies close enough that there's no room for doubt or hesitation between them.*"],"swipe_info":[{"send_date":"May 30, 2025 12:50pm","gen_started":"2025-05-30T16:50:46.132Z","gen_finished":"2025-05-30T16:52:42.518Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":8946}},{"send_date":"May 30, 2025 12:52pm","gen_started":"2025-05-30T16:52:45.813Z","gen_finished":"2025-05-30T16:54:14.389Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":8568}}],"tracker":{},"gen_started":"2025-05-30T16:52:45.813Z","gen_finished":"2025-05-30T16:54:14.389Z"}

After fleeing her abusive father, Hailee takes refuge in the Camerons' guesthouse, where unresolved attraction collides with self-destructive habits. Their relationship oscillates between reckless passion and protective devotion.\n\n#### **Key Plot Points:**\n1. **Violent Confrontation & Shelter**: Hailee punches her father for insulting Sarah and flees to Tannyhill, where Sarah negotiates her stay despite Ward’s disdain (*“She’s my person”*).\n2. **Hospitalization**: A brutal beating leaves Hailee comatose with a brain bleed; she wakes weeks later fixated on missing their planned date.\n3. **Oral Revelation**: During *Never Have I Ever*, Sarah admits she’s never orgasmed from oral; Hailee promptly corrects this (*“Point fucking taken”*).\n4. **Inheritance Crisis**: Hailee reveals their grandfather left her and JJ $5 million—triggering her father’s violent retaliation when she refused to sign it over.\n\n#### **Character Analysis:**\n- **Sarah Cameron**: Overprotective yet tender; hides vulnerability behind snark but is determined to shield Hailee from self-destruction (*“I’d burn this house down for you”*). Guilt over privilege wars with genuine care, especially witnessing Hailee’s trauma-fueled recklessness (e.g., punching walls, binge drinking). Recently more assertive about mutual feelings but insists on sobriety for consent/authenticity (*“Ask me sober”*).\n- **Hailee Maybank**: Volatile yet fragile; swings between anger and desperate clinginess. A budding alcoholic abused by her father, she seeks solace in Sarah but struggles with trust/self-worth (submissive during sex vs defensive aggression elsewhere).\n\n#### **Relationship Dynamics:**\nFrom bitter ex-friends to charged allies-turned-lovers via push-pull patience vs self-sabotage (Sarah pleads *“Not like this”* during drunken advances). Physical intimacy contrasts emotional guardedness—Hailee clings desperately while pushing away help; Sarah yields physically but demands sober recognition of their bond beyond liquor-fueled impulsivity.\n\n#### **Memorable Moments:**\n- ***Shower Kiss Turning Point***: Drunk!Haileenearly kisses sober!Sarah mid-shower; Sarah pulls back insisting on sobriety (**Catalyst for emotional honesty**).\n- ***Ward's Discovery***: Post-drunken night together, Ward catches them—Sarah defends fiercely while Rafe lurks ominously (**Family tension escalation**).\n\n#### **Current Situation:**\nHailee is hospitalized post-beating (broken ribs, brain bleed) but wakes disoriented yet immediately possessive of Sarah/JJ securing their inheritance papers before confronting her father again—while still recovering physically/emotionally from abuse cycles.\n\n---\n\n### Potential Directions:\n1) Relapse & Rescue → If H sneaks out seeking booze post-recovery → violent encounter forces confrontation w/Cameron family dynamics (**Quote Hook**: *\"Touch her & what Dad does will feel like a spa day.\"*)\n2) Sober First Time → If H stays clean 24hr → will S keep promise? (**Callback Hook**: *\"Ask me again sober.\"*)\n3) JJ Discovers Truth → His reaction could fracture trio or unite them against abusers (**Looming Threat**: Rafe noticing bruises/suspicions.)."},"force_avatar":"User Avatars/1745455478960-HaileeDemiCat.png","tracker":{}}

Every rock of Hailee’s hips is met with equal pressure, every gasp rewarded with a firmer stroke.*\n\n“Look at you,” *she breathes,* leaning down to nip lightly at Hailee’s jaw.* “So fucking perfect like this—taking what you need from me.”\n\nHer free hand slides up to cradle Hailee’s face, forcing those green eyes open just enough to meet hers:\n\n“Want you to watch,” *she murmurs,* thumb brushing over kiss-swollen lips.* “Watch how good you make me feel.”\n\nThe hand between Hailee’s thighs doesn’t stop its relentless rhythm, but Sarah shifts just enough so Hailee can see how affected *she* is—the flush creeping down her neck, the way her own breath comes quicker now. It’s an unspoken promise: *You’re not alone in this.*\n\nWhen Hailee finally tips over the edge with a choked-off cry, Sarah strokes her through it gently—whispering praise against sweat-damp skin until every last tremor subsides. Only then does she reach for the sample cup with her free hand, carefully collecting what's needed before pressing a lingering kiss to Hailee's forehead:\n\n\"Done,\" *she murmurs,* wiping her hands clean before immediately returning them to cradle Hailee's face.* \"You okay?\""],"swipe_info":[{"send_date":"May 30, 2025 1:46pm","gen_started":"2025-05-30T17:46:31.172Z","gen_finished":"2025-05-30T17:47:24.408Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":10012}},{"send_date":"May 30, 2025 1:47pm","gen_started":"2025-05-30T17:47:41.353Z","gen_finished":"2025-05-30T17:48:56.375Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":32793}},{"send_date":"May 30, 2025 1:49pm","gen_started":"2025-05-30T17:48:59.135Z","gen_finished":"2025-05-30T17:49:48.255Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":10779}},{"send_date":"May 30, 2025 1:53pm","gen_started":"2025-05-30T17:52:51.139Z","gen_finished":"2025-05-30T17:54:14.842Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":9741}}],"tracker":{},"gen_started":"2025-05-30T17:52:51.139Z","gen_finished":"2025-05-30T17:54:14.842Z"}
