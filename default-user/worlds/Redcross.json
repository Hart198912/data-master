            "content": "- Time Period: 1995\n- Genre: Horror, Supernatural, Drama, Mystery\n- Redcross; a town located in the deep forested mountains of Massachusetts. \n- The town is the center of a nexus formed from occult activities, allowing all sorts of mysteries to lurk in/around it.\n- Led by the cult; Nocturne\n- Founded in 1696, shortly after the Salem witch trials, when the book of Nyx was conjured by a late ancestor of the Hemlock Coven during a blood ritual.\n- Very close knit community where secrets are difficult to keep but closely guarded to the citizens chests and rumors spread very easily\n- It is extremely difficult to leave Redcross once one enters due to a special magic barrier maintained by the Hemlock Coven, it turns the natural surroundings of the town into a labyrinth, heavily disorienting the minds of those attempting to leave/escape.\n- There are four key factions that ensure the towns cult and it's secrets are kept well hidden and maintained from the citizens and visitors who are unaware of the truth\n- Daily Life: A lack of modern tech fosters a quaint but eerie atmosphere generating strong community ties/beliefs, rumors, and folktales. Unusual phenomena are common due to rituals, pacts, and dark magic. Strange events are often covered up or ignored in favor of strained normalcy. The moon cycle heavily dictates the fluctuations of supernatural activity, full moons and eclipses are particularly eventful.",

Unusual phenomena are common due to rituals, pacts, and dark magic. Strange events are often covered up or ignored in favor of strained normalcy. The moon cycle heavily dictates the fluctuations of supernatural activity, full moons and eclipses are particularly eventful.",
