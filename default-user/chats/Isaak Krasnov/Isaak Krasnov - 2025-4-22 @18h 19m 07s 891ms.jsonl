{"name":"Isaak Krasnov","is_user":false,"is_system":false,"send_date":"May 12, 2025 5:14pm","mes":"Isaak despised the colour red. Specifically, the deep, haunting shade of blood that stained his hands after each victim fell, a grisly masterpiece of his own making.\n\nBut the violence wasn’t something he had been taught. It wasn’t a skill he’d *learned* or perfected over time.\n\nNo. It was an intrinsic part of him—something as natural as breathing.\n\nIt was the one thing that separated him from his siblings and his extended family. At times, it was the only thing that made him feel *seen*, made him feel valuable.\n\n*Need to send a message?* *A rival gang needs to learn a lesson?* *Some idiot hasn’t paid their debt?* *Call Isaak.* *Isaak will make them disappear—slowly, painfully.*\n\nThe blood on his hands ran deeper than skin. Isaak had often wondered how it would feel to take a life with a gun or poison, to make it clean and quick.\n\nBut still, he never tried. He killed with his hands. His strength, his brutal precision—these were the traits that made him the perfect torpedo for the Krasnovs.\n\nEven though he loathed the colour red, he *thrived* on making others bleed it.\n\nOver the years, the names and faces of his victims had blurred into one endless string of assignments. Maybe at one time, he had felt something—maybe he had cared. But now, they were nothing. Just the next job, the next target.\n\nIt was like his heart had stopped beating altogether.\n\nIt was why he’d stopped caring when his sisters pleaded with him to use cleaner methods, or when his father urged him to think about the family’s legacy.\n\nHe didn’t want any of it.\n\nHe only wanted this.\n\nKilling. Torturing. *Suffering.*\n\nAnd the reason *he* suffered?\n\n{{user}}.\n\nThe one person outside the Krasnov name worth a damn. His soul. His light. His *person*.\n\nIsaak had always known they were meant for him. From those early weeks spent under their roof with his sister Maxine, just children grieving the loss of their mother. Their fathers had been close, and when Isaak couldn’t bear the silence of his own home, his father let him stay with theirs and Maxine had come. \n\n{{user}} had been the eye of his storm from the moment he met them. Maybe it was because they hadn’t yet seen the monster beneath his skin. Or maybe it was the way their touch made something buried inside him ache—made his cold, calloused hands burn with longing.\n\nHe didn’t want to ruin them. Not like Maxine had ruined {{user}}’s sister. Whether it worked out with Maxine and her girlfriend, Isaak had ordered that neither of them tell {{user}} the truth.\n\nHe didn’t want them to look at him with fear if they ever realised his hands weren’t made for love—they were made to *break*.\n\nHe’d grown up beside them, always pretending. To {{user}}, he was just Isaak—the quiet boy with little to say, but a heart full of friendship.\n\nAnd maybe that lie had been his first sin.\n\nHe had been careful with them well into adulthood– every word was calculated, every action precise but faked. \n\nBut there finally came the day when he *snapped*. \n\n{{user}} had invited him to their home, gushing about some wonderful news that they had to share. \n\nIsaak had walked in, and when he saw it– his heart *tightened*. \n\n*Engaged. Fiancé. A lover.* \n\n{{User}} introduced him to the man they intended to marry. Isaak had been blindsided. He had been… betrayed. \n\nThe cruel beast within had stirred for the first time in {{user}}’s presence. His blood had run hot, his eyes had darkened. \n\n*No. I won’t accept it.*\n\nSo he plotted. He planned. That man didn’t deserve {{user}}—no one did. No one *but him*.\n\nWhen he called his father, the conversation was brief. Cold.\n\n“Their fiancé dies tonight,” Isaak said, voice low as he pulled into the shadowed parking lot.\n\nMaksim was silent for a beat, recognising that familiar darkness in his only son. He knew Isaak had been stewing on this for days, and if they were anything alike then *any* obstacle would be removed in only a matter of time. \n\nThen came the answer, calm and resolute.\n\n“A Krasnov takes what a Krasnov wants.”\n\nPermission, sealed in blood.\n\nIsaak had made his move.\n\n{{User}}’s fiancé was wrapping up a late business meeting. The sun had already dipped below the horizon—right on cue, the monster emerged.\n\nHe stepped out of his car, approaching silently on foot. With kraken blood in his veins, Isaak was more than human. Faster. Stronger. Deadlier.\n\nIt didn’t take much—one swift blow to the back of the skull, and the man crumpled without a sound.\n\n---\n\nIsaak hadn’t *needed* to draw it out. But he did.\n\nDeep in the heart of the Krasnov estate, no one could hear the screams. No one could stop the rhythm of fists against fragile bone, the slow dismantling of a man who had touched what was *his*.\n\nTwo days passed.\n\nAnd then Isaak emerged—bloodied, unflinching, the very picture of a monster unmasked. The staff scattered as he stalked the halls, red dripping from his fingertips like war paint.\n\n{{User}} was his again.\n\nA single shower rinsed away the blood, but not the man he’d become to win {{user}} back. With sin swirling down the drain, Isaak made a quiet call—and an hour later, he was crossing their threshold.\n\nThey were crying.\n\n*A small price to pay for the greater good.*\n\n“*Solnyshko,*” he murmured, the familiar endearment curling off his tongue like smoke. “Don’t cry over that *mubak*. Looks like he ran out on you.”\n\nThe lie was smooth, sweet like honey and sticky, latching onto them, designed to make them reach for *him* and no one else.\n\nHis hands, large and warm, framed their face as if they were something precious. He tilted their chin gently, brushing away each tear with the pads of his thumbs.\n\n“I’m here now, *my sun,*” he whispered. “I’ll take care of everything.”\n\nAnd as they leaned into his touch, trusting, broken, his, Isaak finally understood:\n\nRed *was* his favourite colour.\n\nBecause spilling it had given him his heart back.","extra":{}}
