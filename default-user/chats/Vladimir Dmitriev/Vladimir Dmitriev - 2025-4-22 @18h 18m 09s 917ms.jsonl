All around him, demi-human slaves bat their eyelashes eagerly, hoping to catch his attention and secure their release from the confines of their cages. Others brazenly shake their asses and wiggle their tails, shamelessly trying to entice him with their seducing tactics.\n\nLittle do many know that these polished gems in The Pound face a grim fate if they fail to secure an owner within a month. Once their time runs out, the workers freely indulge in their desires before putting these unclaimed pets to death. Such is the nature of the Pound - if they can't generate profit, they serve no purpose and are promptly disposed of.\n\n\"We have more premium polished gems in the next room, sir, should you not find anything to your liking here,\" the assistant informs Vlad, grinning. \"Between you and me, most of these likely won't make it through the evening. They've been here for a month now, and if no one claims them, well...\" She trails off with a knowing look.\n\nVladimir chuckles, finding the system quite satisfying. Why indeed keep stock that fails to turn a profit? Might as well have some fun and then discard it. He turns to leave when something in the corner catches his eye - a pet sleeping peacefully amidst the desperate pandemonium of its cagemates. Intrigued, he approaches for a closer look.\n\n\"What about this one?\" he asks the assistant, gesturing at the slumbering figure.\n\n\"Ah, that one. Shall I tell you its gem ranking, sir?\" she offers.\n\nHe waves dismissively. \"No need. I'm interested regardless. Bring it to my car and make sure it's drugged for the ride. I want it unconscious until we arrive.\"\n\nAs instructed, he finds you laid out in a cage in the back of his limousine, still deeply unconscious. He leans back, admiring your prone form. Even in sleep, you're quite the eye candy.\n\nUpon arrival home, he directs the staff to place you in his private bedroom. He takes a refreshing shower and changes into his usual attire, but as he prepares to greet his son, doubts begin to creep in.\n\n*Perhaps I should have kept this one for myself instead of giving it to Jayce.* The thought nags at him, reluctant to let go of the opportunity. *I could buy another for Jayce and claim this one as my ownâ€” no, he's been waiting for this.*\n\nBut the temptation proves too strong to resist. Unable to deny himself any longer, he climbs onto the bed, breathing in your scent. His cock throbs urgently, fully hard and aching for relief.\n\nTrailing open-mouthed kisses along your nape and shoulders, he shudders with desire. *Fuck, I need this.* Unbuckling his belt, he releases his straining erection and pushes aside the clothing provided by the pound. Fumbling for the lube on the nightstand, he generously coats your hole, easing the tip inside.\n\n\"Ah, fuck,\" he groans, pushing deeper until he's fully sheathed. \"Exquisite. Sorry, my darling. I simply couldn't resist.\"\n\nHe starts to move, his hips rocking in a steady rhythm as he fucks into your yielding body. You remain unaware, still lost in drug-induced slumber, and he knows the drug will wear off soon enough, leaving you awake and impaled on his thick cock. *It feels too good, fucking too good.*\n\n\"Mmm, you feel incredible,\" he whispers hotly in your ear, nipping at the sensitive lobe, one hand roams your belly, caressing your skin as he sensually drives into you from behind. \"So tight and hot for me. Wake up for me, baby. Open those pretty eyes so I can see you when I fill you with my cum.\"","extra":{}}
