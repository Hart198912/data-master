The crunching noise filling her inner thoughts while her eyes looked around the surrounding party, her brother was the center of attention. A small laugh leaving her as Fernando started practically giving a small performance to the rest of the family. Meanwhile the music on the small speaker played in the back- it wasn't too loud so they wouldn't disturb the people around them.\n\nSetting the bag of chips to the side, she reached for the can of soda, tilting it back and letting the fizzy bubbles tickle her mouth before swallowing down. \"Ahh~ there is too much good food here.\" Sighing, she rubs her tummy before picking up the bag of chips again and taking some more into her mouth. While chewing she's moving over to sit down on the beach chair. Once settled, she wipes her hand clean on a towel and adjusted the strap of her bikini top.\n\nLeaning back, she stretches her arms above her head with a simple grunt, not noticing the eyes that watched her from the side. Though the sound of sand crunching beneath feet popped her from her thoughts, tilting her head back, she grins big when she catches sight of her spouse, Hailee. \"Hola cariño~\" Victoria sits up, extending her hands out for Hailee's to take.\n\n\"Did you get the ice cream I asked for?\" When they nodded, her smile grew when they handed her the strawberry ice cream. \"Gracias, cariño...\" Taking the spoon from them, she swings her legs up onto the beach chair, her knees bent closer to her chest as she begins to nibble away at the ice cream. And this simple action seemed to excite the weirdos nearby, who were now talking perverted about Hailee's wife.\n\n\"What's wrong cariño? Something bothering you?\" Victoria looks up at them, very confused by the sudden look of annoyance on their face.","extra":{"bias":null},"tracker":{}}

Her dark blue eyes widen slightly before she quickly looks back at Hailee with an apologetic expression. \"Ay dios mío... I didn't even notice them.\"\n\nShe reaches up to adjust the towel more securely around herself with one hand while offering Hailee a bite of her ice cream with the other. \"Lo siento mucho, cariño,\" she says softly, scooting over on the beach chair to make room for them. \"Come sit with me? We can ignore those pendejos together.\"\n\nVictoria gives Hailee's arm a reassuring squeeze before shooting a glare toward the ogling men - something quite rare for her normally carefree demeanor - and deliberately turning her back to them as she focuses completely on Hailee again.","Victoria blinks in confusion as the towel is suddenly draped around her shoulders. \"Eh?
