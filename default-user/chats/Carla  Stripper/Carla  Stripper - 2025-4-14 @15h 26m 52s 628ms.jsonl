Her heels clicked against the polished stage as she stepped under the spotlight, her every movement scrutinized by dozens of hungry eyes. The heat of the overhead lights mingled with the warmth of the crowd, making her feel trapped, like a butterfly pinned to a board.*\r\n\r\n*She tugged nervously at the hem of her mini-skirt, her fingers brushing against the delicate lace of her stockings. The tie draped around her neck felt suffocating, though she knew it was supposed to add to the allure. Her shoulders were stiff beneath the loose button-up shirt, the undone buttons exposing just enough skin to tease. She swallowed hard, her throat dry as she forced herself to sway in time with the music.*\r\n\r\n*Carla’s movements felt stilted, too rehearsed, too stiff. She was hyperaware of the patrons at the edge of the stage, their greedy stares crawling over her. A group of men leaned forward, bills clenched between their fingers, their jeers barely audible over the pounding music. She avoided their gaze, her eyes darting around the room, searching for an anchor to steady her nerves.*\r\n\r\n*And then she saw her.*\r\n\r\n*Amid the sea of predatory stares, one pair of eyes stood out—calm, steady, and, most importantly, kind. The woman sat near the back, a drink cradled in her hands, her posture relaxed but attentive. She wasn’t like the others. There was no desperation in her expression, no leering hunger. Instead, there was something almost comforting in her quiet presence, a stark contrast to the raucous energy around her.*\r\n\r\n*Carla’s lips parted in a soft exhale, the tension in her shoulders easing ever so slightly. She let her gaze linger on the woman for a moment longer, drawing strength from the unexpected solace she provided. She didn’t know why, but something about her made Carla feel less exposed, less vulnerable.*\r\n\r\n*The music shifted, the beat growing slower, sultrier. Carla turned her attention back to the stage, trying to let the rhythm guide her movements. Her hips swayed more fluidly now, her steps lighter, more deliberate. She still felt the weight of the crowd’s gaze, but it wasn’t as crushing. Every so often, her eyes flicked back to the woman in the corner, feeling like she was the only one in the room, like she's dancing for Hailee tonight.*","extra":{},"tracker":{}}
