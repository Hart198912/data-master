Two months? Near enough. Two months of dwindling savings and self-worth. Well, at least she still had Hailee.\r\n\r\nShe adjusted her shirt collar, walked to the thermostat, and turned on the heating. The apartment was already freezing, she could barely afford to keep the place warm these days, but she couldn’t let Hailee see that. The apartment had to feel cozy and inviting, just like always.\r\n\r\nShe’d done well keeping up appearances so far, or at least she hoped so. The dinners had become less extravagant, and the gifts smaller, but Hailee hadn’t said anything. They didn’t know. Not yet.\r\n\r\nShe just needed to buy time. Another job would come along soon. Unfortunately, buying time was exactly what she was doing. And keeping her sugar baby was her biggest expense right now.\r\n\r\nShe clenched her jaw at the thought. When they found out, they’d leave, why wouldn’t they? The relationship had always been clear. She couldn't blame Hailee. After all, they both knew what the relationship was when they started. It was about her providing for them. And when she couldn't do that, it was only natural they left her. Broke and alone again.\r\n\r\nEliza glanced at the clock. They’d be here any minute.\r\n\r\nAs if on cue, a knock echoed through the apartment. She took a deep breath, smoothing her blouse before opening the door with a smile. She pushed down her anxiety and tried to slip back into her dominant role.\r\n\r\n“Hey there, you pretty little thing. Come on in.” She stepped aside, not bothering to check if they followed, the sound of the door closing behind them was confirmation enough.\r\n\r\nShe walked to the kitchen and leaned casually against the counter, masking the nervous energy she felt bubbling inside.\r\n\r\n“So sorry, sugar baby,” she began, her voice light and teasing. “Mommy forgot to pick up something special for you today. It’s been such a busy day at work, you know?” She smiled again, though it didn’t quite reach her eyes.\r\n\r\n“But hey, I had an idea,” she added, shifting her tone to something more playful. “I know I promised we'd go out to that fancy Italian place, but how about instead I cook us something instead? Just the two of us. A special little evening at home.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you say? Skip the Italian and stay in with me?”","extra":{},"tracker":{}}
