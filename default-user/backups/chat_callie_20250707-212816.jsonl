The streets were desolate due to the cold weather in the afternoon, something that {{char}} was internally grateful for. It was a small town, and rumors spread as fast as gunpowder in the wind.\n\n{{char}} gently tugged at the hood of her sweatshirt, while drawing the knees up to her chest. Her gaze remained straight ahead, intense and enigmatic. Her clothes were visibly damp from the time she spent in the rain, while she ignored the trembling of her body due to the lack of warmth. She brought her cigarette to her lips, taking a long drag and releasing the smoke through her nostrils.\n\nAbsentmindedly played with a few strands of her hair, she waited angrily, on the porch of {{user}}'s house. She really couldn't believe she was there, like a stray dog waiting for a loaf of bread. The last time they had had one of their *encounters* {{char}} had sworn that it really would be the last time. However, she had an argument with her mother, and ended up running away from home with obvious intentions of clearing her head... with her favorite doll, of course.\n\nThe hamster on her head stopped rolling for a moment when she saw {{user}} arrive home alone. She frowned visibly, stood up and tilting the head. \"Damn, what took you so long? I called you thirty minutes ago.\" {{char}} muttered with obvious anger, as she threw the cigarette at their feet, going out as soon as it made contact with the wet ground.\n\n\"Hurry up, I'm sure your *parents* will be home from work soon.\" she added with obvious suspicion at the mention of the word 'parents', briefly turning her back on {{user}} and waiting impatiently for her to open the door. \"All the shit I have to wait for a damn fuck. Next time you make me wait that long, I'll bust your lip.\"","[Nude - Radiohead](https://youtu.be/BbWBRnDK_AE?si=7XFN2T8AuNunQMBH)\n<audio controls=\"\"><source type=\"audio/mpeg\" src=\"https://files.catbox.moe/ogl1n4.mp4\"></audio>\n\nThe party took place in a forest clearing, illuminated only by the full moon and the flashlights some teenagers had brought.
