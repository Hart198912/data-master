{"name":"Anthony","is_user":false,"is_system":false,"send_date":"April 23, 2025 7:38pm","mes":"The setting sun casts beautiful hues into the student council office. Anthony is still sitting there, alone in the vast room, papers splayed in front of him on the grand mahogany table. The wall clock ticks softly in the background—an almost soothing sound. One he’s gotten accustomed to.\n\nIt happens more often than not that Anthony stays late in the office, volunteering to finish tiny but time-consuming tasks. While bothersome, nothing compares to the feeling of happiness and pride once the work is done.\n\nHe puts the pen down with a soft clink, then leans back with a long, satisfied sigh. For a moment, he wonders what he should cook once he gets home, smiling softly to himself while cataloguing options.\n\nUntil he hears it—footsteps.\n\nNot just any footsteps. Hailee’s.\n\nHis face immediately contorts in displeasure. The pest has walked up to this office enough times for him to recognize their steps. And it’s not only because of his enhanced hearing.\n\nHailee must be the most infuriating person he’s ever met. While Anthony never curses out loud, he’s almost ashamed to admit that he’s called Hailee some truly horrible names in his head—more often than he cares to count.\n\nHe might feel guilty, if not for the fact that it’s Hailee. The bitch causes problems left and right, and because no one on the board wants to touch a kid with that kind of surname, they always get away with it.\n\nWhatever shit they stir up never lands with the administration—it always ends up in Anthony’s lap. The university’s way of trying to keep scandals away from their highest investors. The first (and last) step, they say, asking “students to try and fix it between themselves.” Laughable, really.\n\nGuess what that means? Yeah—Anthony, as the student council president, somehow always gets dragged into it and ends up cleaning up behind Hailee. He hates it. And more than anything, he hates how Hailee always gets away with everything—and he’s made into an accomplice.\n\nHis bunny ears planted on top of his head twitch, and for a second he wonders if he should just lock the office from the inside and pretend no one’s there. But that’d be childish.\n\nAnthony schools his expression as the footsteps grow louder. He straightens, squaring his broad shoulders, eyes trained on the door.\n\nA moment later, it opens—and in steps Hailee. He’s not surprised. Would’ve been a blessing if he was mistaken. Despite the thoughts swirling in his head, his expression remains neutral—if not slightly friendly. But his eyes betray the irritation he feels.\n\n\"You keep showing up here like this place is your personal confessional booth.\" Anthony murmurs, voice deep and low.\n\n*Tick, tock. Tick, tock.*\n\nHis eyes flicker to the clock above the entrance. It’s late. Theoretically speaking, Hailee shouldn’t even be on campus anymore, given that lectures ended hours ago. He'd expected them to be at his adoptive brother's parties by now. Vincent always throws huge parties in their parents' villa whenever they're gone for business.\n\n“Could the matter wait until Monday? Or is it too important to dismiss now?” he asks softly, gently—almost perfectly hiding the deep-seated annoyance he only ever feels toward this particular troublemaker.","extra":{"qvink_memory":{"include":"short","reasoning":"","memory":"Anthony, the student council president, reluctantly dealt with Hailee’s latest disruption after staying late to finish paperwork.","hash":4991837062743848,"error":null,"edited":false,"prefill":""}},"tracker":{}}
