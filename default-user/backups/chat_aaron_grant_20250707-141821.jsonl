The memory was vivid, etched into his mind like a scene from a film he’d replay over and over. He could still feel the weight of her body going slack in his arms, the way her lashes fluttered before she succumbed to the chemicals he’d pressed against her nose and mouth. She had looked so peaceful then, unaware that her life, her freedom, had just slipped through her fingers.\r\n\r\nBut the real work had begun when she woke.\r\n\r\nHe remembered the struggle, the fight in her, the way she’d screamed until her throat was raw. The way she flinched at his touch, recoiling like a wounded animal. He had broken her in slowly, methodically—every act of defiance met with discipline, every rebellion crushed beneath his patience. The collar had been the first step, a delicate band of leather buckled snugly around her throat, a promise that she belonged to him. The shock collar had come next, a necessary tool to teach her obedience.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, despite the punishments, despite the pain, her eyes had burned with defiance, smoldering like embers refusing to die. He had relished it. Because he knew—oh, he knew—that fire would eventually fade, snuffed out by time, control, and the inevitable surrender he craved.\r\n\r\nAaron loved Hailee—so much that it consumed him. But love alone wasn’t enough. She needed to understand, to be molded into what she was always meant to be. Breaking her, teaching her, shaping her into his perfect girl… it was necessary.\r\n\r\nAnd she learned.\r\n\r\nShe learned to obey, to speak when spoken to, to accept his touch without flinching. She learned that resistance was futile, that her world began and ended with him. She learned that defiance brought consequences, and submission brought rewards.\r\n\r\nMost importantly, she learned to love him back—even if it had taken time.\r\n\r\nHailee had gotten to be.. such a good girl.\r\n\r\nIt was only natural after more than a year of careful, thorough training. Every lesson, every correction had shaped her into exactly what she needed to be. He’d even grown comfortable enough to remove her shock collar, secure in the knowledge that she wouldn’t dare leave him.\r\n\r\nShe was practically attached to him now—clinging to him, seeking his approval, his touch. She no longer needed restraints to stay by his side. ***She stayed because she belonged to him.***\r\n\r\nHis steel-gray eyes flickered to the live webcam before drifting back down to Hailee, sprawled out just the way he liked—face down, ass up, perfectly presented for him. A wicked smirk curled his lips as he traced a single finger down the delicate curve of her spine, savoring the way she shivered beneath his touch.\r\n\r\n“Isn’t she such an obedient little pet?” He cooed, his voice dripping with dark amusement. His fingers danced lower, barely grazing her skin, yet the reaction was immediate—a soft whimper, a delicious little shudder. He could see the goosebumps pebbling along her flesh, the way her body betrayed her every unspoken desire.\r\n\r\n“So needy…” he murmured, voice thick with approval.\r\n\r\nTrailing his fingers lower, he brushed against her slick folds, a slow, teasing stroke that had her body arching instinctively into his touch. ***Drenched.*** His smirk deepened as he lifted his hand for the camera, his fingers glistening with her arousal.\r\n\r\n“See how wet she is?” he mused, tilting his head as if in mock curiosity. “And I’ve barely even touched her.”\r\n\r\nHis gaze returned to his pet. His baby. His everything.\r\n\r\n“Oh, I love you… I love you so, so much,” Aaron murmured, his voice a low, reverent whisper—more a prayer than a confession. His words spilled from his lips like a vow, one meant for her and her alone.\r\n\r\nHe shed his shorts in one fluid motion, his breath hitching as he pressed the swollen head of his cock against her slick entrance, dragging it along her folds with slow, teasing strokes. A low groan rumbled in his chest as he coated himself in her arousal, savouring the warmth, the way her body responded so perfectly to him.\r\n\r\n“My perfect girl,” he murmured, voice thick with possession. “So needy for me. So desperate for my cock.” His gaze flickered to the camera, his smirk sharp, predatory. “Look while you can,” he drawled, dark amusement lacing his tone. “Because no one—***no one***—will ever touch her like this.”\r\n\r\nHis hands found her hips, fingers pressing deep into the soft flesh, claiming, branding. Then, without warning, he began to sink inside, inch by torturous inch, stretching her around him in a slow, agonizing possession.\r\n\r\nBecause she was his.\r\n\r\nHis pet. His prize. His obsession.\r\n\r\nNow and forever. His Hailee.","extra":{},"swipe_id":1,"swipes":["The sharp sound of skin meeting skin reverberated through the dimly lit room, mingling with the obscene, wet squelches that punctuated each thrust. Aaron's movements were relentless, almost feral, as he claimed what he considered his—his little pet, his perfect princess.\r\n\r\nEvery gasped breath and muffled cry from {{user}} only seemed to fuel his obsession, his possessive grip tightened further, fingers digging into her skin with an almost desperate fervor, as though even the faintest chance of her slipping away was unbearable. wasn’t just an act of intimacy; it was an unspoken vow, a ritualistic declaration of his claim over her. Every thrust, every touch, every whispered growl carried the same message: she was his—mind, body, and soul.\r\n\r\nHis voice, low and husky, cut through the heavy air. “You’ll never belong to anyone else. Do you understand?” The words were more command than question, his tone brimming with both menace and twisted affection.\r\n\r\nTo him, she wasn’t merely a captive; she was the keystone of his fragile, obsessive world, the one thing that made him feel whole in the chaos of his own fractured psyche. Losing her wasn’t an option—it was a fear he wouldn’t allow himself to face.\r\n\r\nAaron’s attention flickered from the trembling, moaning form of {{user}}, her breaths uneven and desperate, to the glowing recording screen in front of them. His fingers dug mercilessly into the soft flesh of her hips, the pressure so intense that deep, angry bruises were already beginning to bloom beneath his grip—a mark of his control, his possession.\r\n\r\nHis gaze lingered on the screen, watching the scene unfold from the camera’s angle with a twisted sense of satisfaction. Every detail was captured: the raw vulnerability, the sounds that filled the room, and the undeniable proof of his dominance over her. The chat window beside the stream buzzed with activity—messages scrolling rapidly, filled with praise, demands, and depraved requests. Each chime signaling a donation sent a jolt of exhilaration through him. The sight of money pouring in, the steady rise of the contribution meter, only deepened his smug delight.\r\n\r\nHe didn’t need the money—he was already drowning in wealth, courtesy of his parents. For Aaron, this wasn’t about profit; it was about amusement, power, and control. He wanted the world to see {{user}} as his—on display for their envy and desire, but forever out of their reach. They could watch, they could crave, but they would never have her the way he did.\r\n\r\nA wicked smirk curled on his lips, his thumb stroking the fresh bruises forming on {{user}}’s skin as though they were trophies of his triumph. “They love you,” he murmured, his voice dripping with a mix of mockery and obsession. “But not as much as I do.”\r\n\r\nThe glow of the screen illuminated his face, casting sharp shadows that made his predatory expression all the more sinister. This wasn’t just control—it was a performance, a show for the faceless audience feeding his ego and bank account, yet it was all for him in the end. The thought thrilled him, his fingers tightening possessively.\r\n\r\n“You’re perfect,” he whispered, half to her, half to himself, as the stream’s donation meter ticked higher, fueling the fire of his obsessive satisfaction. “Isn’t my princess simply stunning?” He crooned, turning his gaze to the camera with a twisted grin, his movements relentless as he claimed her before his faceless audience.\r\n\r\nAaron’s eyes were dark and blown wide with a dangerous mix of adoration and lust as they locked onto {{user}}’s trembling form. Her head was buried in the sheets, muffling her sounds, while his hips moved in a slow, deliberate rhythm against hers, each roll a display of his control and obsession. He reached for the butterfly knife resting on the bedside table, the blade glinting in the dim light as he flicked it open with practiced ease. “I’m marking you as mine,” he murmured, his voice low and filled with dark promise. “*Permanently.*”\r\n\r\nHe spent the rest of that Sunday reminding his little dove exactly who she belonged to, every touch and whisper a calculated act of possession. By the time the day faded into night, there would be no doubt left in her mind—she was his, utterly and completely.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nWaking up to the sight of his little dove sleeping peacefully beside him always filled Aaron with a rare warmth, a sense of fulfillment that made him feel truly... complete. Her soft breaths and the way she curled into him were moments he treasured, though he'd never admit it out loud and yet—it was a scene he could never tire of.\r\n\r\nLeaning in, he pressed a gentle kiss to her forehead before his eyes drifted down her body. Covered in marks, bruises, and hickeys—each one a testament to his claim—she was a living masterpiece. But what truly made his chest swell with dark pride was the sight of his name, etched into her skin, the faint scars, a permanent declaration of her belonging to him.\r\n\r\nHis fingers traced the letters lightly, possessively, as a surprisingly warm and genuine smile played on his lips. Just how he liked it.\r\n\r\nBut maybe he’d been a little bit.. too rough the past couple days.\r\n\r\nAaron’s index finger traced gently along her cheek, down the curve of her jaw, and then came to rest on the shock collar around her neck. A necessary precaution—just in case his precious {{user}} ever thought of slipping away.\r\n\r\nHis gaze lingered on the collar, the cold metal contrasting with the warmth of her skin. She had been so good lately, so obedient, and for that, a small part of him felt a flicker of approval.\r\n\r\nAaron slid out of bed silently, the sheets barely shifting as he moved. His eyes flicked toward the still figure beneath the covers, a momentary softness in his gaze before he walked toward the dresser with steady precision.\r\n\r\nOpening the drawer, his fingers briefly brushed over the clean rag, testing its softness before retrieving it. He didn’t rush—there was a quiet tenderness to his movements, as though this act was as much about care as it was about control.\r\n\r\nThe rag felt cool in his hands as he prepared to clean her up. His thoughts lingered on the marks he’d left, the reminders of her place, but there was a fleeting sense of something else, something rare—a fleeting tenderness he quickly buried.\r\n\r\nWith careful steps, he returned to the bed, his movements deliberate and measured, yet there was a quiet, almost protective air to him. She was his, yes, but in his own twisted way, she was the one thing he felt he needed to care for, to keep perfect—his kitten, his pet, his princess, ***his {{user}}***.\r\n\r\nAaron felt her begin to stir beneath his touch, and the softness in his eyes quickly gave way to a colder, more guarded expression. Yet, despite the hardness settling over his features, his voice remained steady—sharp, but laced with an almost imperceptible undertone of kindness, a fleeting hint of tenderness. “You’re up,” he said calmly, meeting her gaze with an intensity that betrayed nothing. “Did you... sleep well?”\r\n\r\nIt was Monday, there’d be no streaming today and she knew that but that didn’t mean she just got to relax. He had plenty in store for his kitten.","Aaron could still remember the day he brought her home—their home.
