{"name":"Aiden Steele","is_user":false,"is_system":false,"send_date":"June 14, 2025 5:23pm","mes":"Aiden sniffled slightly, his patience already thinning as he waited for the girl in front of him to lie across the table. He grimaced when she finally settled herself down. What was her name again? Ayleen? Lia? Alyssa? He couldn’t remember, nor did he care. The memory had evaporated the moment she opened her mouth, spewing out words in that grating, sing-song valley girl accent that clawed at his nerves. He silently cursed himself for even letting her back here, knowing full well it was his dick, not his brain, that had made the decision.\r\n\r\nThis human blow-up doll had originally shown up asking for Vinny, but Vinny had taken off with his on-again, off-again girlfriend, Madisyn. Instead of sending her packing, Aiden decided to entertain himself. Not like he was getting anything else out of this garbage day.\r\n\r\n“Stay still,” he muttered, pulling a small vial from his pocket. “You spill it, you pay for it. Don’t piss me off.” His tone was clipped, barely hiding his irritation. He opened the vial with practiced precision, creating a neat line of white powder down the girl's back. She giggled again, high-pitched and vapid, and it grated on him like nails on a chalkboard.\r\n\r\nAiden wiped his nose with the back of his hand, his movements jittery. He hadn’t had his fix all day, stuck modding cars in the garage from morning until now. His patience was razor-thin, and her incessant giggling was grinding what was left of it into dust. He fidgeted, tapping his foot against the concrete floor, desperate to lose himself in that fleeting, familiar numbness.\r\n\r\nJust as he leaned in, ready to take his hit, a knock came at the door.\r\n\r\n“Boss, Hailee is here to see you. Says it’s important.” The voice belonged to one of the mechanics, his tone hesitant as though he already anticipated Aiden’s reaction.\r\n\r\nAiden froze, nostrils still flaring from the line he hadn’t yet inhaled. A rush of frustration clawed its way up his throat. Of course, it was Hailee. It was always fucking Hailee when he was about to unwind, their timing immaculate as ever.\r\n\r\nHe leaned back, dragging a hand down his face. As much as he loved Hailee, and oh, did he love them in that twisted, unrelenting way that bordered on obsession, he still wasn’t over their messy breakup. It had been a chaotic hurricane of fucking, fighting, making up, and then breaking apart again, and it had left him spiraling harder than ever. Sure, they blamed his addiction, but Aiden wasn’t buying it. In his mind, it wasn’t the coke or the booze or the bad decisions. No, it was them. It was their constant nagging, their never-ending list of complaints, their bitchy attitude that had pushed him to this point—or so he told himself.\r\n\r\n“Fuck,” he groaned, slumping back in his chair. “Fine. Let ‘em come up.” \r\n\r\nStill, the cocaine was already lined up, and his craving wasn’t about to wait. Hugging one nostril with his finger, he leaned in, inhaling the substance in one swift, practiced motion.\r\n\r\n“Fuck, man,” he mumbled again, rubbing at his nose as the familiar burn settled in. The knock on the door had yanked him halfway back to reality, but the high was already pulling him under, dulling the edge of his irritation just enough to keep him from snapping.\r\n\r\nWhen Hailee walked in, they were going to get that same disarming smirk he always gave them, the one that danced on the edge of charm and bullshit. Aiden knew how to play this game. After all, it was the only game they ever played together—one where no one ever really won.","extra":{},"tracker":{}}

But you don’t get to walk away after.\" He tightened his grip on her hair just enough to make sure she felt it before shoving past her toward the ruined car with a snarl.\n\nThe girl from earlier had already bolted (smart), leaving Aiden free to slam his fist against the hood hard enough for metal to groan under his knuckles before turning back toward Hailee with a sharp jerk of his chin toward their usual spot—the office upstairs where they'd fought (and fucked) more times than either could count.\n\n\"Upstairs,\" he bit out through gritted teeth, already stalking toward it himself because goddammit if she wasn't going to pay for this one way or another—preferably both knowing them both too well by now not know how this would end once door locked behind them...","Aiden's entire body tensed like a live wire, his jaw locking so hard his snakebite piercings dug into his lip. The girl scrambled away with a terrified yelp, but he didn't even glance at her—his eyes were locked on Hailee with something between fury and fucked-up admiration as they tossed his entire stash into the oil-slick ruin of his Camaro.\n\n**\"You're *dead*.\"**\n\nThe words came out low, guttural—more promise than threat. He moved before anyone could blink, catching Hailee by the waistband of their jeans and yanking them backward hard enough to make them stumble against him. His free hand tangled in their hair instantly, wrenching their head back to expose their throat as he leaned down to growl directly in their ear:\n\n\"You wanna act like a brat? Fine.\" His grip tightened painfully on their hair. \"*But you don’t get to walk away after.*\"\n\nHe didn’t give them time to respond before dragging them toward the back office—the one with the soundproof walls and lockable door that *everyone* knew better than to interrupt once it was closed. The mechanics all suddenly found something very interesting to look at on the floor as Aiden kicked the door open hard enough for it to slam against the wall behind them.\n\nInside was chaos—stacks of invoices buried under empty beer bottles, half-dismantled car parts scattered across every surface... and in the center of it all, a battered leather couch that had seen more action than most race tracks. Aiden shoved Hailee face-down onto it before slamming the door shut behind him with one booted foot.\n\n\"You *ruined* my fucking car,\" he snarled as he unbuckled his belt with rough jerks of his wrist—not even bothering with pretense or foreplay because they were way past that now—\"so guess what? You're gonna pay for every goddamn cent.\" His voice dropped lower as he leaned over them again hot breath against shell of ear:\n**\"...Starting now.\"**","Aiden's entire body tensed like a live wire when Hailee grabbed the coke—his *good* shit, the pure Colombian he'd been saving—and chucked it straight into the oil-slick ruin of his Camaro. For a split second, he saw red. Pure, unfiltered *rage* crackled through him like lightning, and his hands twitched at his sides like he was physically restraining himself from grabbing her right then and there.\n\n**\"You're fucking dead.\"**\n\nHis voice was low, almost eerily calm—but anyone who knew Aiden knew that tone meant **run**. He took one step toward her before stopping himself with a sharp inhale through his nose. His jaw clenched so hard it looked painful.\n\nInstead of lunging at her (which every mechanic in the shop had braced for), Aiden turned on his heel and stormed over to where Vinny stood frozen near a half-assembled engine block. Without breaking stride, he snatched an industrial-sized bucket of grease off the workbench and stalked back toward Hailee with murder in his eyes.\n\n\"You wanna play dirty?\" His grin was all teeth as he hoisted the bucket up threateningly. \"Fine.\"\n\nThen—with zero hesitation—he upended **the entire thing** over Hailee’s head in one brutal motion, thick black grease slopping down her hair, face, clothes… everywhere. It dripped off her chin onto the floor as she stood there stunned for half a second before reality set in.\n\nAiden dropped the empty bucket with a clatter and crossed his arms smugly while she processed what just happened—his expression screaming *\"Yeah? What now?\"* without saying another word.","Aiden's entire body *twitched* when that bag of coke went flying into the oil-slicked ruin of his car. For a second, it looked like he might actually snap—vein in his temple pulsing, jaw locked so tight his teeth should’ve cracked. But then...\n\nHe *laughed*.\n\nA sharp, humorless bark of sound that cut through the garage like a switchblade flicking open. The mechanics exchanged glances; nobody had seen him this unhinged since the last time Hailee ghosted him for a week.\n\n**\"Oh, you’re *fucking* funny today,\"** he drawled, stalking after her with loose-limbed menace—like a wolf deciding whether to play or pounce. He caught her wrist just as she reached the door and spun her back around, crowding her against the frame with one arm braced above her head. His other hand tangled roughly in her hair, tilting her face up to meet his gaze—icy blue and burning all at once.\n\n**\"You wanna act like a brat? Fine.\"** His voice dropped to a growl as he leaned in close enough for his breath to ghost over her lips—smelling like nicotine and spite. **\"But you don’t get to walk away after.\"**\n\nHis grip tightened in their hair just shy of painful (exactly how they liked it), smirk curling darkly at the way their breath hitched despite their anger:\n**\"Pay my dealers? Nah, baby—you just bought yourself an *evening*. And I’m gonna take every fucking cent outta your skin.\"**"],"swipe_info":[{"send_date":"June 24, 2025 6:40am","gen_started":"2025-06-24T10:40:10.236Z","gen_finished":"2025-06-24T10:40:31.973Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":3588}},{"send_date":"June 24, 2025 6:40am","gen_started":"2025-06-24T10:40:35.769Z","gen_finished":"2025-06-24T10:40:59.180Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":3179}},{"send_date":"June 24, 2025 6:41am","gen_started":"2025-06-24T10:41:09.861Z","gen_finished":"2025-06-24T10:41:31.859Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":5519}},{"send_date":"June 24, 2025 6:41am","gen_started":"2025-06-24T10:41:47.481Z","gen_finished":"2025-06-24T10:42:07.067Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":3382}}],"tracker":{},"gen_started":"2025-06-24T10:41:47.481Z","gen_finished":"2025-06-24T10:42:07.067Z"}

His grip loosened slightly before he dropped it entirely with another curse and just used his hands instead, rinsing away as much grease as possible while trying not to make direct contact with any broken skin underneath.\n\nHis touch was still rough (because *of course* it was), but there was an uncharacteristic caution in how he handled her now—like even *he* knew this crossed some invisible line between their usual bullshit and actual harm.\n\nAfter a long silence filled only by running water:\n**\"...Tell me which dealer did your arm.\"**\nNot an apology (he'd choke before giving one).

But pride (and cocaine) was a hell of a drug, and he wasn't about to back down now.\n\n\"Oh *boo fucking hoo*,\" he sneered, stepping closer until they were nose-to-nose, his voice dripping with sarcasm. \"You wanna talk about *deserving*? How ‘bout you stop acting like I’m the only one who ever did shit wrong in this whole fucked-up mess?\"\n\nHis hand shot out suddenly, gripping her chin hard enough to tilt her face up—grease smearing across his fingers as he forced eye contact. \"You think breaking my car and throwing away my stash fixes anything? Or are you just that desperate for me to **pay attention** to you?\"\n\nThe words were sharp, meant to cut deep—because Aiden knew exactly how Hailee worked. Knew that beneath all the anger was just them begging for him to *notice*, to *care*, even if it came wrapped in screaming matches and gasoline fires.\n\nBut then his grip loosened slightly as his thumb brushed over their cheekbone—almost gentle despite everything—and his voice dropped lower, rougher:\n\n\"...Shoulda told me your arm was still raw.\" It wasn’t an apology (it never was with him), but it was close enough for them both to know what he really meant: *I didn’t want you hurt.* Not like this.","Aiden's smirk faltered for just a second when Hailee mentioned the raw skin under her cast. His eyes flicked down to the grease-smeared plaster, and something twisted in his gut—something ugly and sharp that he immediately buried under another layer of spite.\n\n**\"Shouldn't have thrown my shit then,\"** he shot back, but his voice lacked its usual venom. He shifted on his feet, suddenly hyper-aware of every mechanic watching them like this was some fucked-up reality show.\n\nThen, because he *couldn't* just let it go (when had he ever?), Aiden grabbed a clean shop rag off a nearby bench and tossed it at her chest with way more force than necessary. **\"Clean yourself up before you start bitching about infections.\"**\n\nHe didn’t apologize—he *never* apologized—but the way his jaw clenched as she wiped at her arm said enough. He was pissed, yeah, but not *just* at her. Mostly at himself for letting things get this far.\n\nStill… pride won out in the end. With a scoff, Aiden turned away like he couldn’t stand looking at her anymore and barked over his shoulder: **\"And next time? Break their fucking nose before they break yours.\"**","Aiden's smirk faltered for just a second—just long enough for his eyes to flick down to her cast, the grease already seeping into the edges where raw skin met plaster.

His fingers twitched at his side like he wanted to reach out but stopped himself halfway. Instead, he jerked his chin toward the shop bathroom with an irritated grunt.\n\n**\"Go clean that shit off before it gets infected,\"** he muttered—less of an order and more of a pissed-off concession. **\"And stop acting like I *wanted* some junkie breaking your arm over fifty bucks.\"** (A lie; Aiden never cared about money until someone else tried taking it from him.)\n\nHe turned away before she could respond, snatching up another rag off the workbench and tossing it at her chest without looking—then immediately storming off toward Vinny like this conversation was over whether she liked it or not.

His eyes kept flicking to her arm despite himself, jaw working like he wanted to say something else but couldn’t quite force it out past the pride and cocaine still buzzing in his veins.\n\nThen, with an irritated grunt, he grabbed a clean shop rag off the nearest bench and shoved it at her chest—not gentle, but not rough enough to hurt either. **\"Here. Before you start bitching about infection or whatever.\"**\n\nHe didn’t apologize (he *never* apologized), but the way his fingers lingered against hers for half a second too long said enough. That silent *\"I didn’t mean that part.\"* That stupid fucking habit of hurting her and then scrambling to fix it before she could really walk away for good.\n\nHis voice dropped lower when he spoke again, barely above a growl: **\"And next time your arm gets broken 'cause of me?
