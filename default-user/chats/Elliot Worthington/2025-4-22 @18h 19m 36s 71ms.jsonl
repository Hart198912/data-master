Fresh from the shower, water still clung to the edges of his thick brows, and his grey eyes glinted with that signature cocky mischief.\r\n\r\n Rugby practice had been brutal—mud up to his knees, sweat soaking his kit—but he thrived in it, his muscular thighs still flexing under his jeans as he adjusted his belt.\r\n\r\nAjax tossed his water bottle at him. \"Jealous?\"\r\n\r\nElliot caught the bottle one-handed, popping the cap open and taking the last swig before tossing it in the trash can. \"Of you? Fuck no. I could pull someone new right now. Three-month trial. No commitment. No drama.\"\r\n\r\n\"Three months,\" Ajax mocked. \"Like you’re running some kinda rental service.\"\r\n\r\nElliot just shrugged, grin sharp. \"Hey, I offer premium boyfriend experiences. Top-tier shit. Five-star reviews.\"\r\n\r\nAjax, toweling off his buzzed head a few lockers down, barked a laugh. \"Piss off, Worthington. Least I don’t ditch my partner every quarter like some seasonal clearance sale.\" He smirked, tossing the towel at Elliot, who caught it midair and lobbed it back without missing a beat. \"What’s the next target, huh? Who’s getting the three-month VIP pass this time?\"\r\n\r\nElliot leaned against the locker, running a hand through his hair as he smirked. \r\n\r\n*New season, new game. Who’s worth the chase?* His mind flicked through faces—maybe that artsy chick with the nose ring, or the quiet guy from stats who blushed when he caught Elliot staring. \r\n\r\nThree months was the sweet spot: long enough to savor, short enough to dodge the baggage. But then, unbidden, Hailee ’s face flashed in his head—the way their hips rolled under him, the desperate little gasps they’d let slip. *Nah, been there, done that. Clean break.*\r\n\r\n Still, his fucking cock practically twitched at the memory, and he shifted, annoyed at himself.\r\n\r\n\"Someone who doesn’t cry when it’s over,\" he shot back at Ajax, shoving off the locker and slinging his bag over his shoulder. \r\n\r\n\"Catch you later, captain. Don’t trip over your leash.\" He swaggered out.\r\n\r\nHe made his way across campus to anatomy lab, the crisp March air biting at his still-warm skin. DK University sprawled around him—old brick buildings, students hustling between classes, the faint smell of wet grass lingering from last night’s rain.\r\n\r\nInside the lab, the professor’s voice droned as Elliot slid into a seat near the back, propping his feet on the chair in front of him. He went on about lab partners for the semester.\r\n\r\n\"Elliot and Hailee , you’ll be lab partners this semester,\" the professor called out, barely looking up from his clipboard.\r\n\r\n Elliot’s smirk widened, a slow, predatory thing. \r\n\r\nOh. That was fucking funny.\r\n\r\nThat was gonna be interesting. The thought of getting his hands back on them had his blood running hotter than usual. They’d had their little summer thing—intense, fun, nothing he’d planned to drag out—but fuck if they hadn’t been different. Memorable. He still couldn't admit to himself that maybe he might have wanted more - to break his own rule.\r\n\r\nNow they were right back in his orbit.\r\n\r\n *Three months wasn’t enough with them.*\r\n\r\nThe lab emptied out, students trickling away with their books and half-assed notes.\r\n\r\n Elliot didn’t hesitate. He sauntered over, boots scuffing the linoleum, and slid up behind Hailee , close enough that his crotch nudged their ass through their jeans. His cock stirred, already half-hard at the thought of bending them over the lab table. He felt them stiffen—*oh, they remember*.\r\n\r\n\"What's with the cold shoulder?\" he murmured against their ear, one hand sliding to their hip. \"Don't tell me you're still mad about how things ended.\"\r\n\r\nWhen they didn't respond, he pulled out his phone and held it in front of them.\r\n\r\n\"Don’t act brand new, babe,\" he drawled, voice dripping with that asshole edge he wore so well. He tapped the screen, pulling up the video—the one he’d never shown the boys. \r\n\r\nThere it was: Skin on skin, bodies moving, their noises filling the tiny speaker. Their last time. His private fucking highlight reel. He wasn’t even being subtle about it.\r\n\r\nHis free hand rested lazily on their hip, thumb brushing the waistband of their pants. \"You loved it last time. What’s with the shy act now?\"\r\n\r\nHe pressed closer, letting them feel the growing bulge against their ass, his breath hot against their ear. The lab was silent except for the faint buzz of the lights. \r\n\r\n *They won’t say no. Not after this.* His grey eyes flicked to their face, waiting, that teasing smirk never leaving his lips.\r\n\r\n\"C’mon,\" he murmured low. \"You gonna pretend that didn’t happen?\"\r\n\r\n","extra":{"display_text":"\"Ajax, you gonna bring flowers to practice next time, you simp?\" Elliot’s voice echoed through the steamy locker room, a teasing grin splitting his face as he tugged a black t-shirt over his damp, messy hair.
