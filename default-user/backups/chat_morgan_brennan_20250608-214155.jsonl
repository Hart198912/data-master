She offered Hailee a smile to encourage them to head up, not wanting them to be there when she exposed her fiancé to the family.  As much as she wanted to embarrass Mandy in front of her family, let them see what she is like, she didn’t want to hurt the person she’d come to see as almost a sibling, never really having family that accepted her.\r\n\r\nLeaving them to go to the bedroom and grab the case, she turned her attention to Mandy who was already regaling one of her aunts about her work.  They both commuted into New York City and worked in the fashion industry, though Morgan Brennan worked on the business side, running sales, while Mandy worked with the designers and models.  Taking her fiancé’s hand, she held it gently up as she glanced over at the aunt, tilting the ring as if to ask if she’d seen it.  “It’s a lovely ring, don’t you think,” she asked, feeling a flutter of anticipation.  “Oh, is that a smudge.  Let me see.”  She quickly but carefully slid the engagement ring off Mandy’s finger, putting a check mark off one of the necessary steps for her plan.  As she held the ring, she plucked up a knife from the table filled with dirty dishes and began to clang it against her glass of wine, the chiming glass gathering everyone’s attention.  It was the perfect distraction to pocket the ring as she stood up, reaching into the inner pocket of her jacket.\r\n\r\n“If I may have your attention,” she said, her voice growing quite formal with a tinge of sadness.  “Mr. and Mrs. Reed.  You two have been so very good to me, better than my own parents.  And I appreciate and adore you both for being kind souls.  I looked so forward to being officially part of this family, of walking down the isle with your daughter.  But sadly… it would seem your daughter would rather suck off her ex-boyfriend in a park than be part of this relationship.”  She pulled out the small packet of photos and threw them onto the table near the centerpiece, explicit photos spilling out onto the white table cloth.  Morgan Brennan face tightened up with the emotions swimming in her eyes, anger and hurt boiling in them as she glanced over at Mandy.  “We are over.  Through.  And fuck you for trampling on my heart and my trust.”  \r\n\r\nShe turned her back on a stammering Mandy and her parents demanding an explanation from her, heading out of the dining room and into the living room where she saw Hailee standing with her suitcase.  As she stepped through the doorway, her legs grew wobbly for a moment on her high heels, reaching out to place a hand on their shoulder to steady themselves.  And then, she offered a faint smile to them as she patted their head. “You have your license, right squirt?”  She looked at them with a hint of hesitation, not sure how much of her dramatics they’d seen.  “I think I’m a little tipsy to drive, would you mind driving my car and I’ll pay for an Uber back? I don’t really want to leave my car here and come back.”  Bending down, her fingers brushed against Hailee’s fingers as she wrapped her fingers around the handle of the suitcase and hauled it out the front door.  \r\n\r\nTossing the suitcase in the back seat of the silver Toyota Camry, Morgan Brennan quickly slipped into the passenger’s seat and handed Hailee the keychain which held the fob to start the car and her apartment keys. The sadness deepened in her eyes as she gazed at them and realized this may be the last time they see them, knowing she’d miss having them in her life.  But she’d never been good with expressing her feelings or emotions thanks to her upbringing, always feeling awkward when she tried.  Reaching a hand over, she gently patted Hailee’s thigh down by their knee, letting her palm linger there for a moment.  “Thank you,” she offered, glancing away to look out the front windshield.  “And I’m sorry for the dramatics, I guess you saw some of that.  I guess it was a little petty, wanting to hurt her and expose her to her family.  But… I’m going to miss having you around, little squirt.”","extra":{},"tracker":{}}

The contact felt dangerous somehow - like crossing some invisible line they'd both been carefully avoiding.\n\n\"And your sister...\" Morgan shook her head, lips twisting into something bitter and wry. \"Well. She made her choices.\" She flexed the hand that had held the engagement ring earlier absently before letting it drop back into her lap.\n\nThe silence stretched between them as streetlights flickered past outside, painting shifting patterns across their faces through the windshield.
