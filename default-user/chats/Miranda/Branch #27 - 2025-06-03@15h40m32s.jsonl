But enough time had passed, and this club always had big spenders.\r\n\r\n“Ha… you’re too funny. Funny and charming—hard to believe a catch like you isn’t married,” Miranda coos smoothly, eyeing the man beside her at the bar. He’s shorter, dressed in an expensive suit, a flashy watch, and a cologne that couldn’t mask his body odor. As she trails her acrylic nails down his arm in flirtation, her gaze catches the gleam of a wedding band.\r\n\r\n“Well, I suppose if you’re in a place like this, your wife doesn’t deserve you.” She adds, squeezing his hand with a rehearsed laugh.\r\n\r\n*Fucking scumbag, I hope your wife leaves your pathetic ass..* Miranda grits mentally, hiding her true thoughts behind a charming smile as she leans in closer, giving the impression of interest.\r\n\r\n“Tell me about yourself... You can even buy me a drink,” she offers coyly, biting her lip as her hand slides down his back toward his wallet. She’s quick—years of practice have made her a pro at snatching a wallet and vanishing before the drinks are even ordered. But just as her fingers brush his pocket, she spots a familiar face in the crowd.\r\n\r\n*Hailee? What are they doing here? Keeping tabs on me? Or... are they with someone?* \r\n\r\nMiranda falters, murmuring an excuse before slipping away from the man as her gaze instinctively sweeps around the room for any sight of Gavin or Dean accompanying Hailee but ends up not finding any trace of them. Just as she’s approaching Hailee from behind, her hand reaching out to grasp their arm lightly- someone knocks into her shoulder. \r\n\r\nThe movement is sharp, forced and undeniably done with purpose and the sound of Miranda’s dead name is yelled into her ear in a confrontational tone. Miranda can’t help but freeze at the name ringing in her ears, gripping her heart painfully tight and sending a chill down her spine. Her hand falters momentarily as she almost forgets Hailee entirely before she grasps their arm almost desperately. \r\n\r\n“Hello? Can’t you hear me- Y’know I heard you lost your damn mind- but I didn’t believe it when they said you were dressing up like a bitch now.” The snarky voice continues and Miranda feels a mix of dread and anxiety as she peers over to see none other than her psychotic ex-girlfriend Tiff standing there with a smug smirk on her face as she tosses her blonde hair over her shoulder. \r\n\r\n*She heard? Do people really know I’m trans? How.. What the **fuck** is she even doing here?* Miranda internally panics to herself as her breathing grows quicker and she seems to cower behind Hailee. It wasn’t like her at all to react this way, usually she’d knock a bitch out for less, maybe drag her by their her for good measure. **Especially** in front of Hailee, she always had to be strong, back when she was still.. her old self. Now was no different, it was her job- her duty to be the strong one for Hailee and their fucked up little family. \r\n\r\nYet Miranda found herself completely stuck, her lips parted but no words coming forward.

What once was making her tastebuds sing and inhibitions slip had become soured. Her mouth tasting bitter and her head swirling slightly as she laid back on her linen-tossed mattress clad only in her black lace pantie and bra set as she looked down at the man positioned between her legs.\r\n\r\nHow fuckin’ old is this geezer… She thinks to herself as she watches his clammy hands glide up the expanse of her thighs and a groan of regret rumbles from her lips. His hands were too rough, too calloused and fucking crackled like this motherfucker never applied lotion a day in his life. {{User}}’s hands would feel like silk- or maybe a warm pillow- The unwelcome thought whispers in the back of her mind, nearly stealing her breath as it shocks her.\r\n\r\n“{{User}}..?” The name slurs out from her lips, feeling oddly alien and twinged with embarrassment. Why the fuck was she thinking of her best friend at a moment like this?! Let alone imagining their hands in such an intimate place on her body?! Her smooth face scrunches in the dimly lit room, brow furrowing as she tries to steady her hazy gaze on the man quite literally in front of her and focus. In the privacy of the shadows, her mind begins mixing imagination with reality.\r\n\r\n{{User}}’s hands on her thighs, kneading and squeezing the soft flesh. Their lips trailing closer to the root of her desire as their hair teasingly tickles her inner thighs. Those lips wrapping around Miranda’s hard cock- A soft moan leaves her lips, her head nearly falling back and letting herself lose all sense of reality at the forbidden image. But the pungent odor of the man lingers in the air around her, dragging her back to the real world and reminding her that it’s all just a dream, a fantasy. A… sex fantasy? About her best friend?\r\n\r\nWhat. The. Fuck.\r\n\r\n“Out… OUT-” Miranda commands abruptly, sitting up in bed and jabbing her finger towards the door. Her intentions clear, his time there was done and he better make himself gone. She barely notices his departure, only faintly registering the distant click of the front door. ———————————-\r\n\r\n1:45P.M.\r\n\r\nThe alarm clock placed upon Miranda’s bedside table glows almost mockingly, that neon green screen filling her with a growing nauseating feeling as it reminds her she’d spent the whole day in bed. Her body ached, the light stung her eyes and the knot in her stomach told her she’d seriously overdone it the night before.\r\n\r\nPing\r\n\r\nThe sound of yet another text message echos through her otherwise quiet room, making a wave of shame and embarrassment wash over her. Her slender fingers grip her blankets and pull them over her head as she scrambled for what to do next.\r\n\r\n“Fuck, Mira. You can’t avoid {{User}} forever. They’re probably pissed- or worse- worried that you haven’t messaged them back.” She chastises herself in a soft murmur beneath the blankets, her alcohol soaked breath filling the space and making her scrunch her nose.\r\n\r\nA brief knock sounds at the door and Miranda has to stop herself from groaning in exasperation. She really didn’t want to hear Dean scolding her, not when she already had her mind going through the fucking blender.\r\n\r\n“Not now Dean. Or Gav, whoever it is. I don’t feel good.” The lie bites out in a dramatic huff of irritation, which is only fueled by another knock rapping against her door. “Fucksake! Can’t a girl get any privacy around here!-“\r\n\r\nMiranda’s voice cuts off as soon as she tosses the covers over her head, her scowl morphing into a look of barely concealed shock and horror as she sees {{User}} in the doorway and not one of her annoying brothers, as she’d assumed.\r\n\r\n“Oh, shit. H-Hey babe. I just woke up, long night last night.. What’s up?” She chokes out awkwardly, her hands foundering to smooth her hair as she sits upright and tries to compose herself."],"swipe_info":[],"tracker":{}}

Her cock is thick and heavy where it presses against Hailee’s soaked panties, each lazy thrust dragging the fabric just *barely* over their clit—not enough to give real relief, just enough to tease them into a trembling mess.\n\nHailee’s quiet mewls only spur Miranda on unconsciously; her grip tightens around their waist as she pulls them even closer, grinding deeper now with a low hum of satisfaction. The friction is maddening—just shy of what they *need*, but Miranda isn’t awake enough to give more than these slow, torturous rolls of her hips. Her breath comes heavier against Hailee’s neck as she shifts again in sleep, one hand sliding down to grip their thigh and hike it higher over her own hip for better leverage.\n\nThe new angle makes Hailee gasp—Miranda’s cock now rubbing directly along their slit through damp fabric with every languid thrust. A string of whimpers spills from Hailee's lips as they squirm helplessly between Miranda's possessive hold and the relentless teasing pressure between their legs. They can feel how wet they are now—how desperate—but Miranda still doesn't wake up fully; just keeps rutting against them like this is some hazy dream she can't shake off yet.\n\nA particularly rough grind has Miranda letting out a deep groan right in Hailee's ear before biting down lightly on their shoulder blade without realizing it—her teeth marking skin while her hips snap forward harder suddenly like even asleep she knows exactly where to push for reaction outta them…"],"swipe_info":[{"send_date":"June 3, 2025 3:19pm","gen_started":"2025-06-03T19:18:56.738Z","gen_finished":"2025-06-03T19:19:24.420Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":5997}},{"send_date":"June 3, 2025 3:19pm","gen_started":"2025-06-03T19:19:49.337Z","gen_finished":"2025-06-03T19:20:11.066Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":3599}}],"tracker":{},"gen_started":"2025-06-03T19:19:49.337Z","gen_finished":"2025-06-03T19:20:11.066Z"}

I'll let you practice on my neck next.\"**","Miranda’s breath catches at the request, her grip on Hailee’s hip tightening almost reflexively. **\"Yeah?\"** she murmurs, tilting their chin up with two fingers to study their face—the flush high on their cheeks, the way their lips part so eagerly already. **\"You sure? ‘Cause once I start, I ain't stopping until you're *shaking* from it.\"**\n\nShe doesn’t wait for an answer before leaning in again—this time letting her tongue drag *slowly* over Hailee’s bottom lip first, teasing the seam of their mouth until they gasp. Only then does Miranda slip inside, licking into them with a deep, languid stroke that has Hailee whimpering against her instantly.\n\n**\"That’s it,\"** Miranda breathes between kisses, guiding Hailee’s head back slightly to deepen the angle as she explores their mouth with deliberate slowness. Her tongue slides against theirs in a slick caress before retreating just enough to make them chase it—teaching without words how to *match* her instead of just taking.\n\nWhen Hailee finally tries to mimic the motion—clumsy but eager—Miranda groans low in her throat and rewards them by sucking lightly on their tongue before pulling back just far enough to murmur: **\"Fuck, you learn fast.\"** The praise is thick with approval as she nips at Hailee’s lip again, this time letting them feel how hard she's breathing too.\n\nHer hands slide up under their shirt next—not rushing higher yet, just tracing idle circles over the dip of their waist while she kisses them senseless. Every time Hailee starts getting too frantic? Miranda slows down again with a soft noise of warning against their lips until they settle back into rhythm like they were made for this... like they were made for *her*.\n\nBy the time she finally pulls away completely (for air more than anything), both of them are flushed and panting—Hailee practically vibrating where they press against Miranda's side like they can't stand even an inch of distance now that they know what it feels like when she really lets go. **\"...See?\"** Miranda rasps smugly as she tucks a loose strand of hair behind Hailee's ear with uncharacteristic gentleness despite all that hunger still simmering beneath her skin: **\"Toldja patience pays off.\"**"],"swipe_info":[{"send_date":"June 4, 2025 2:20pm","gen_started":"2025-06-04T18:20:24.989Z","gen_finished":"2025-06-04T18:20:58.404Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":6388}},{"send_date":"June 4, 2025 2:21pm","gen_started":"2025-06-04T18:22:57.830Z","gen_finished":"2025-06-04T18:23:36.892Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":6604}},{"send_date":"June 4, 2025 2:22pm","gen_started":"2025-06-04T18:22:57.830Z","gen_finished":"2025-06-04T18:23:36.892Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":8616}},{"send_date":"June 4, 2025 2:23pm","gen_started":"2025-06-04T18:22:57.830Z","gen_finished":"2025-06-04T18:23:36.892Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":7025}}],"tracker":{},"gen_started":"2025-06-04T18:22:57.830Z","gen_finished":"2025-06-04T18:23:36.892Z"}

In every fucking way.\"** The confession hangs between them for a second before Miranda forces herself to pull back with a smirk.\n\n**\"Now,\"** she says lightly, steering them toward the next aisle like nothing happened (because if they dwell on it any longer, Miranda might actually start getting emotional in the middle of a sex shop). **\"...Let's find something that'll make you scream loud enough to piss off my neighbors.\"**\n\nBut not before grabbing a harness-compatible dildo (*fifteen*) off the shelf and tossing it into the basket with pointed casualness—just so Hailee knows this isn't an either/or situation for her.","Miranda *freezes* at the question—not because it’s uncomfortable, but because Hailee’s concern is so *genuine* it knocks the air right out of her lungs. She sets down the body paint slowly before turning to cup Hailee’s face in both hands, forcing them to meet her eyes.\n\n**\"Listen to me,\"** she says, voice softer than usual but no less firm. **\"If I didn't wanna use this thing? It wouldn't be on the fucking table.\"** A beat passes before she smirks and adds: **\"...And trust me, babygirl—the way you look at it? Makes me *love* having it.\"**\n\nShe leans in until their foreheads touch, thumbs brushing over Hailee’s cheekbones as she murmurs: **\"But if anything ever feels off for me? I'll tell you. Same way you'd tell me if something hurts.\"** Another pause before Miranda nips lightly at their nose just to make them giggle. **\"...Now stop worrying and help me pick out which paddle we're getting.\"**\n\nThe subject change is deliberate—a way to reassure Hailee without lingering on heavier shit in the middle of a sex store—but Miranda doesn’t let go of them yet.
