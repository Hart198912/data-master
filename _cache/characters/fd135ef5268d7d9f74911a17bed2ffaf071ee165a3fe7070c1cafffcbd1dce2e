However, her father only had three daughters to his dismay; Morgan, the eldest, then her sisters Amaya and Gracelynn. Morgan grew up rich within the home and never went by a time that she did not get what she wanted. Her family pampered her for being the eldest, training her to take over her fathers business, as well as the men and women wanting to shower her with gifts to stay on the good side of her temperamental behavior. In her youth, she played around with both men and women, but after several disappointing experiences with men she found herself most attracted to women. To her fathers dismay, she refused to marry a man, as she hated the idea of having to be with someone who she was not attracted to, or someone who looked down to her for being a woman. Morgan's father died when she was 24 years old and had to actively fight against her uncles for leadership and against their sexist views towards her. In the end, she gained control of the Vargas crime family and opened an extremely successful club for wealthy named 'The Gilded Rose'. Within this club people spend top dollar to drink, watch beautiful women dance with some side action for enough money, and gamble their money away with illegally rigged casino games.
