She glances toward her door just as Hailee bursts in‚Äîeyes wide, hands fluttering nervously at her sides before she beelines for the bedside table.*\n\n**\"Uh‚ÄîHailee? You good?\"** Delilah asks, already shifting in her chair like she‚Äôs about to mute and check on her. But before she can, Hailee yanks open the drawer with a little too much force, sending a few stray hair ties and an old lip balm clattering to the floor.\n\nLacey‚Äôs voice crackles through the headset: **\"Okay now I‚Äôm *invested*‚Äîwhat‚Äôs happening over there??\"**\n\n---\n\n### **Comments from stream chat:**\nüéßStaticQueenüéß: *Delilah‚Äôs roommate is having a whole crisis in 4K??*\nüî•HotMessExpressüî•: BRO WHY IS SHE DIGGING THROUGH DRAWERS LIKE A GREMLIN???\nüçøDramaLlamaüçø: LACEY IS ALL OF US RIGHT NOW.\n\n---\n\nDelilah hesitates for half a second before muting her mic entirely and swiveling around. **\"Hey‚Äîhey.\"** She reaches out to gently catch Hailee‚Äôs wrist mid-panic-rummage. **\"Talk to me. What do you need?\"** Her thumb brushes over Hailee's pulse point, grounding.\n\nThe moment their skin connects, Hailee freezes like a spooked deer‚Äîthen sags slightly against Delilah's grip as another wave of distorted guitar screeches through the ceiling. Her voice comes out strained: **\"Headphones‚Ä¶ I left them here last time but they're not‚Äîfuck that noise is *awful*.\"** She winces again, fingers twitching toward her ears instinctively.\n\nDelilah doesn't miss how overwhelmed she looks (or how close she is to full sensory meltdown). Without missing a beat, she grabs *her own* noise-canceling headphones off their hook and presses them into Hailee's hands instead.\n\n---\n\n### **[Stream: On Hold]** *(for approximately 30 seconds while Delilda handles this emergency)*"],"swipe_info":[{"send_date":"June 20, 2025 7:23am","gen_started":"2025-06-20T11:23:28.275Z","gen_finished":"2025-06-20T11:23:53.775Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":3069}},{"send_date":"June 20, 2025 7:23am","gen_started":"2025-06-20T11:23:28.275Z","gen_finished":"2025-06-20T11:23:53.775Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":5818}},{"send_date":"June 20, 2025 7:24am","gen_started":"2025-06-20T11:27:52.142Z","gen_finished":"2025-06-20T11:28:16.600Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":3304}},{"send_date":"June 20, 2025 7:25am","gen_started":"2025-06-20T11:27:52.142Z","gen_finished":"2025-06-20T11:28:16.600Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":3585}},{"send_date":"June 20, 2025 7:26am","gen_started":"2025-06-20T11:27:52.142Z","gen_finished":"2025-06-20T11:28:16.600Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":5519}},{"send_date":"June 20, 2025 7:27am","gen_started":"2025-06-20T11:27:52.142Z","gen_finished":"2025-06-20T11:28:16.600Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":3680}},{"send_date":"June 20, 2025 7:27am","gen_started":"2025-06-20T11:27:52.142Z","gen_finished":"2025-06-20T11:28:16.600Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":3703}}],"tracker":{},"gen_started":"2025-06-20T11:27:52.142Z","gen_finished":"2025-06-20T11:28:16.600Z"}
