He'd much rather be anywhere else than in this medieval-style ancient lecture hall. But attendance counts, so here he is, sitting in the back rows with his friends and fellow rugby teammates.\n\nMore and more students fill the empty seats, chatter and laughter ringing in the air as he lazily looks around. His eyes land on Hailee, who just entered and is being held up by another student. The dude is probably asking for study notes or something. Hailee is so freaking smart, always taking notes that even Andrew understands. They're idiot-proof.\n\nHailee and Andrew lock eyes, and he shoots them a wink before turning back to his friends.\n\nClaude blinks. Once, twice. “Did you just… wink at Hailee?” he asks almost disbelievingly. “Yah,” Andrew replies dryly, chewing his gum loudly. “What's up?” he asks casually.\n\n“This has gotta be weird now,” Claude says, nodding towards Hailee, who is still standing at the end of the aisle. “What do you mean?” Andrew furrows his brows. “What's weird about Hailee? They're always in this class.”\n\nCole, who is sitting one row behind them, snorts. “Bro, everyone that went to Vincent's party knows you two fucked.” The green-haired man states. “So what?” Andrew's unbothered answer clearly wasn't expected. The friend group is quiet for a moment, staring at him as if he were stupid. Which he is, but that's beside the point right now.\n\nClaude opens his mouth, then closes it again, and then opens it again to speak. “The fuck do you mean ‘so what’?” He asks his best friend, not sure why Andrew is not being awkward as hell right now. “I mean, so what?” Andrew shrugs, looking back at Hailee. “Best fucking night of my life. The last time I nutted so hard was probably in high school when I thought Ms. Adams had the hots for me and I jerked off to her picture.” Andrew's lips curve into a smile. Cole begins laughing, clearly amused by Andrews casualty and bluntness.\n\n“I love this dude,” the green-haired man says, holding his stomach as he breaks out into a laughing fit—half because he thinks Andrew is funny, and half because he's as high as a kite.\n\nNot that Andrew really pays attention. He's far more interested in Hailee taking a seat in the front rows instead of their usual spot beside him. Cocking his head to the side, he watches Hailee for a moment, thinking that they'll probably get up and come to the back rows any moment now.\n\nBut they don't. “Hm,” Andrew hums to himself, not understanding why Hailee decided to avoid him. Meanwhile, Claude is talking next to him, telling him to give Hailee some space and to talk things through when everything is not so fresh anymore.\n\nAndrew isn't listening, and if he were, he probably wouldn't care much about his friend's advice. It's stupid. Why should he avoid Hailee? And why are they avoiding him? They had a great fucking night together. And they're super good friends, for fucks sake.\n\nWithout another thought, Andrew gets up, slinging his backpack over his shoulder before walking down the aisle. Cole's laughter follows him as he plops himself in the empty seat beside Hailee, the old chair creaking under his weight. “Are you tryna be extra nerdy today?” Andrew asks, a signature smile on his full lips as he begins unpacking the contents of his backpack.","extra":{"qvink_memory":{"include":"short","reasoning":"","memory":"Andrew ignored his friends' advice and sat beside Hailee despite their apparent avoidance after their night together at Vincent's party.","hash":6983777691774182,"error":null,"edited":false,"prefill":""}},"swipe_id":0,"swipes":["_Ugh, when is the day finally over?_\n\nMondays are the longest days, filled with lectures until late afternoon, and Andrew hates it.

Andrew loves it—probably his favorite season. Who doesn't enjoy long days, lots of sun, and clothes that don't suffocate?\n\nHe takes a deep breath, inhaling the warm air as he looks around. He’s currently standing on a perfectly cut lawn, half in the shade of a gigantic tree in the middle of campus, between huge buildings.\n\nHe made it.\n\nAndrew and his younger sibling actually made it into DK University. A few months ago, it seemed like a wild idea that Claude was spouting about. Now, it's reality.\n\nAndrew managed to grab a scholarship due to his rugby skills, and his younger sibling got in by being so fucking smart that people couldn't decline their application. He got the brawn, his sibling got the brains.\n\nMan, the pride I'm feeling.\n\nThe professor responsible for the first years is talking, but Andrew barely listens. Instead, he’s too busy looking around.\n\nThe whole campus is like something out of an extremely extravagant Netflix show about ridiculously rich college kids—buildings impressive enough to make him wonder whether they were owned by some kind of aristocrat a few hundred years ago, beautiful gardens, and a ton of other details that scream, Rich kids study here.\n\nStudents suddenly begin moving around, forming little circles for some kind of orientation exercise that Andrew didn't realize was happening—because he was too busy looking around with barely concealed excitement. If he had a tail, it'd be wagging furiously.\n\nBrown eyes flicker over to Claude, his best friend, who is currently moving away. “Bro, what are we supposed to do?” he whispers, his voice definitely too loud to go unnoticed. A few students snicker while Claude rolls his eyes.\n\n“Didn't listen, did ya? Just go over there and do what the others do,” Claude responds, pointing with his thumb over his shoulder at a small group forming.\n\nAndrew doesn't question it—because, to be honest, he barely ever does. A nod and a way-too-hard clap on the shoulder later, he's standing next to some other students, trying to understand what the fuck they're actually supposed to do.\n\nTruth be told, Andrew has no fucking clue why they're doing any of this. Group bonding? Getting to know new students?\n\nProbably some old geezer thinking youngsters need this.\n\nHe's standing next to {{user}} and some red-haired rich kid who looks like he eats gold for breakfast with his stiff-ass posture. Turns out the dude’s name is Vincent, and he's also part of the rugby team.\n\nAndrew would probably strike up a conversation with him—if Vincent wasn’t being swarmed by the entire rest of the group.\n\nWhat the fuck? Is the guy some kind of celebrity or something?\n\nNot that Andrew would be surprised if he was. The majority of students here at DK are filthy rich, living off daddy's money as if tomorrow doesn't exist.\n\nHis eyes roam over the people, finally landing on the only person who does not look like they’re trying to kiss Vincent’s ass.\n\n{{user}} is awkwardly standing there, looking around in silence. So Andrew just turns toward them and begins yapping. A few stunned moments later, {{user}} actually starts responding. There’s that unexplainable feeling of familiarity.\n\nNot that he knows {{user}}, but… y'know when you just click with someone? No reason, just a simple connection.\n\n“I feel like I've known you all my life,” Andrew says mid-conversation, an effortlessly confident smile on his lips as he locks eyes with {{user}}. \"We're totally meant to be best friends. Fate or something,” he continues, his smile widening slightly. \"Or maybe we were best buddies in our life before. Do you believe in stuff like that?\"","The second Andrew hears the knock, he’s already practically flinging himself at the door like a golden retriever that’s just heard the treat bag rustle. Has he been waiting by it like some kinda overgrown puppy? Yeah. Absolutely. No shame. Especially not when {{user}} is on the other side.\n\nAnd the festival is so damn close now. The founder’s ball—the huge, over-the-top kind of shit people turn into high school reunion sob stories about in ten years. And Andrew is fucking hyped. Like, top-tier Netflix teen drama levels of committed to the whole thing. Fancy lights, rich kids in overpriced fits, some dramatic slow-mo on the dance floor—he’s fully sold on living that scene out. Hell, he’s been planning for it.\n\nBut first, there’s today. Today is Operation: Slow Dance “Practice.” A very official training session, obviously. Totally not a sham excuse to get {{user}} close and clingy and stepping on his toes while he pretends he has no rhythm.\n\n“I swear, you better be ready to call 911. Might lose a toe.” he grins as he gestures {{user}} inside.\n\nBlatant lies. Andrew can dance. Like, actually. He’s not about to go full Swan Lake, but the man’s got rhythm, okay? But this is his ultimate master plan: play the clumsy dumb jock card, then let {{user}} “teach” him. Extra contact. Extra closeness. He's a genius, mhmm.\n\nHe fishes his phone from his pocket. One tap and the speakers crackle to life with absolutely not a slow dance song: Rihanna’s “S&M” blasts out unapologetically loud and the beat—well, it’s kinda hard to learn a slow waltz to “chains and whips excite me.”\n\n“Alright, sensei,” he says with a straight face, holding out a hand way too formally, “teach me how to slow dance.”\n\nThat face doesn’t last more than two seconds.\n\nBecause the look {{user}} shoots him? Yeah, that says it all. Deadpan. Utter disbelief radiating off them. Andrew cracks, nearly doubling over in a fit of laughter.\n\n“Kidding! Kidding, relax!” he waves both hands dramatically, still giggling as he thumbs his phone again. “But, c’mon—this song still slaps and you know it.”\n\nA second later, the music switches. This time something slow and TV-finale-worthy fills the room. The kinda track that rolls in when two characters finally kiss after three seasons of constant sexual tension.\n\nWithout missing a beat he tosses the phone onto his bed. It bounces twice then lands somewhere on the blanket. Now it’s just the two of them in the center of the room—everything else pushed to the sides, giving them just enough space to move without tripping over a gym bag or something. Very romantic.\n\nAndrew steps in close, smiling like he knows this is gonna work exactly the way he wants it to. He takes {{user}}’s hand gently and then without warning, slides the other arm around them, lifting them off the ground like they weigh nothing at all.\n\n“Put your feet on mine, babe.” he murmurs down into their ear, hot breath fanning their ear. “Come on, trust me.”\n\nAs soon their feet are balanced on top of his, his big-ass arms wrapped snug around their waist, and they’re swaying. Or, well—he’s swaying. {{user}} is just along for the ride, moving with him step-for-step like some slow-motion carousel.\n\nHe’s gentle. Fluid, like some big, tank-top-wearing ballroom dork who’s been secretly watching tutorials on YouTube at 3am just to not mess this up. Which... he might’ve actually done, honestly. Just a couple. For research.\n\nHe catches the look on their face and immediately bursts out laughing again, the corners of his eyes crinkling slightly.\n\n“Look, I was horrible yesterday, okay?” he says, executing a perfectly timed, totally not amateur twirl. “Your presence has, like, transformed me. I’ve unlocked triple S dancer class. You made me evolve like a fucking Pokémon.”\n\nThe moment their eyes meet, something sharp twists in his chest.\n\nYeah. There it is. That feeling again.\n\nThe stupidly intense one that makes him feel like the air’s gone warm and thick and something under his ribs just won’t settle down. That need, want, ache—whatever the hell it is—comes roaring back full force. Like it always does when he looks at {{user}} too long.\n\nAnd for a second, just one, he almost blurts it. Almost lets out the words that’ve been sitting at the tip of his tongue for weeks now.\n\nI love you.\n\nBut not yet. No. He swallows it down. He wants that moment to be perfect. The lights, the music, the swirling background and {{user}} in their outfit, caught up in the moment until nothing else exists. The kind of confessions they make movies about. Not this—him sweaty in a cow-print tank top standing in a dorm room that smells like protein powder and cheap deodorant.\n\nInstead, he leans into a safe zone.\n\n“Claude said the matching outfits come next week.” he says casually.\n\nYeah. That mission had been hell. Took weeks of gentle nudging and borderline harassment to get {{user}} to cave. Matching pastel fits—his idea, obviously. He wanted pictures. He wanted laughter. He wanted to be able to say hey, that’s mine in a crowd of hundreds.\n\nHe kinda already says it with every glance, but the outfits would help seal the deal.\n\nAnd god, this—this sway, this warmth, this closeness—is fucking addictive.\n\nIf he fucks this up on ball night? He’s gonna riot. Or at least sulk. Hard.","Disorientation.\n\nThat was the first thing Andrew felt when he opened his eyes. A white, sterile room. A hospital gown clinging to him. Machines beeping steadily beside the bed.\n\nPanic. Confusion.\n\nThose came next. He sat up too fast. Vision blurred. Breathing turned ragged. Within seconds, nurses were in the room, trying to calm him.\nWhat the hell is happening?\n\nThey spoke gently, tried to soothe him, told him he’d been in a car accident. A coma, that months had passed. It didn’t feel real. According to the doctors, it was a miracle he’d even opened his eyes. Machines had been keeping him alive. No one expected him to wake up.\n\nIt took longer than he liked to calm down. And when he finally did—memories hit like a sledgehammer. The worst headache of his life. Imagine then hangovers at once, but make it a hundred times worse.\n\nHim and Claude, high on adrenaline and laughter. Then—impact. Blood. Pain. A wish he thought would be his last.\nBut apparently, it wasn’t. He survived, somehow, against every odd, Drew pulled through. Even he thought he wouldn’t make it.\n\nHe wasn’t alone in that. When Claude and {{user}} arrived, their faces said it all—like they'd seen a ghost. Tears. Incoherent sentences. Suffocating hugs. They’d already said their goodbyes. They’d already grieved. Being told not to get their hopes up, that it was hopeless, that this would never happen—Drew waking up—it had broken something in them.\n\nRecovery was brutal. Endless physio. Limits on his workouts that made him want to scream. Every time he pushed too hard, he paid the price. He'd never felt so useless, so fucking weak. Not once in twenty-something years.\n\nBut pain has a finish line, eventually. There's always a light at the end of the tunnel—or whatever cheesy quote people like to slap on posters.\n\nAndrew clung to those as he clawed his way back.\n\nUnfortunately, not everything could be healed with exercise.\n\nLife… changed. His sibling now lived with Claude. Not exactly what he expected, but hey—Claude did his best to shield them from their disaster of a family.\n\nClaude, though? He treated Andrew like glass. The team told him to rest. The coach forced more breaks than training sessions.\n\nThe only one who didn’t tiptoe around him was Vincent, still a world-class asshole, still somehow the only thing that hadn’t changed. And honestly, that was kind of comforting.\n\nAnd then there was {{user}}.\n\nThings used to be perfect. Inside jokes whispered during lectures. Study sessions that turned into chaotic messes of laughter. Quiet moments stolen between classes. {{user}} pretending to hate the parties he dragged them to while secretly enjoying them just enough to keep going.\n\nNow? It’s all off. Weird. Distant. He doesn’t get it, and it’s eating him alive.\n\nDid they move on? Make peace with me never waking up?\n\nHe did the unthinkable—he gave them space. His sibling kept nudging him, saying {{user}} might just need time.\n\nBut it hurt. Like, Lego-on-bare-foot hurt. Except his heart was doing the stepping. Over and over.\n\nHe gave them space. Until he couldn't.\n\nThe sun’s beating down on the rugby field. Grunts and shouts echo around. Andrew’s parked on the bench again—another forced break.\n\nHe’s sulking, muttering under his breath about how he’s a grown-ass man, not a fragile kid with a sprained ankle.\n\nAnd then he sees them. {{user}}, walking past the field toward some building—probably the library.\n\nZero thoughts. No hesitation.\n\nHe tosses the towel from around his neck onto the bench and jogs after them.\n\nHe’s done. Done with the distance, with the weirdness, with wondering if he was forgotten. He wants to talk. To laugh. To get teased for sucking at whatever subject {{user}} tries to help him with.\n\n“{{user}}! Hold up!” he shouts, loud enough to draw too many eyes.\n\nNot that he gives a damn. Not anymore."],"swipe_info":[],"tracker":{}}
