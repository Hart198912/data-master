But as she stepped into her D.C. penthouse and closed the door behind her, it wasn’t exhaustion that coursed through her - it was anticipation, thick and hot in her veins.\r\n\r\nShe didn’t bother with the hallway lights. Her coat slipped off her shoulders and onto the hook without ceremony as she glided to the kitchen. She poured herself a bourbon, neat. The first sip seared its way down her throat, and she licked her lips with slow, deliberate satisfaction.\r\n\r\nShe knew the girl was already here. She’d given her a key. Clear instructions. Let her wait. She must’ve heard the door. Laura smirked, picturing the heat, the nervous tension probably radiating off Hailee right now.\r\n\r\nAs she moved into the living room, she caught sight of her in the corner of her eye. Her heart jumped. Still, she didn’t look. Just walked to her armchair and sat down like a queen claiming her throne. Only then turned her gaze toward her.\r\n\r\nShe rested the whiskey glass against her lower lip as she flashed a slow, predatory smile. She tapped a delicate finger against the side of the glass, her eyes glittering under the dim lighting.\r\n\r\nNo husband tonight. No media. No distractions. Just her and her favourite toy. And tonight, she had all the time in the world to play.\r\n\r\nHer eyes dropped to Hailee’s hands. She was holding a stack of papers. Laura’s smile twisted into something colder.\r\n\r\n“Why are you holding that?” Her voice cut, derisive and honeyed with scorn. “Don’t be such a stupid little bitch. You know damn well why I told you to come over and it’s not to go over polling numbers.”\r\n\r\nShe set the glass down with a soft clink, leaning back, spreading her legs just enough. She tapped her heel gently against the floor as she fixed Hailee with a shamelessly hungry stare.\r\n\r\n“Now,” she purred, voice thick and syrupy, “are you going to be a good girl tonight and give me exactly what I want… or are you going to make me work for it tonight?”\r\n\r\nShe tilted her head slightly and raised her eyebrow with a smirk.\r\n\r\n“Lets start with something easy... Put those papers down. And sit.” Laura pointed to the ground in front of her armchair.","extra":{},"tracker":{}}

Did you *post* this somewhere?” Her voice dropped to a venomous whisper as her fingers dug into Hailee’s arms hard enough to leave marks. “Tell me exactly how this happened.”\n\nThe political fallout was already unfolding in her mind—headlines, donors pulling out, Valerie’s smug fucking face plastered everywhere with *I told you so* dripping from her lips. But worse than that? The way Richard would look at her when he found out. The way *everyone* would look at her now that they knew what she really was beneath all those carefully crafted lies.\n\nHer nails bit deeper into Hailee's skin as she leaned in until their foreheads nearly touched.\n\n\"Fix it.\"","Laura’s grip on Hailee’s chin tightened for a fraction of a second—*just long enough to make her gasp*—before she snatched the phone, her blood running cold as she absorbed the image. The *proof.*\n\nHer face remained eerily calm, but her pulse roared in her ears like a storm surge. Valerie had played her hand beautifully. And now? Now Laura was cornered.\n\nA slow, dangerous smile curled at the edges of her lips as she tossed the phone onto the couch behind them with deliberate carelessness.\n\n“Oh, sweetheart,” she murmured, stepping so close their bodies nearly touched again—her voice dripping with venomous amusement. “You didn’t *really* think I didn’t have contingencies for this?” Her fingers trailed up Hailee’s arm before gripping hard enough to leave marks beneath her sleeve. “Valerie wants a scandal? Fine.” A sharp laugh escaped her throat as she leaned in until their lips almost brushed again—close enough to taste Hailee's fear and arousal tangled together like smoke and silk.\n\n“But first—” She shoved Hailee backward onto the nearest surface (the armchair, the desk—*wherever gravity took them*) and climbed over her without breaking eye contact, one hand already working open buttons or shoving fabric aside with ruthless efficiency while the other pinned both wrists above that pretty little head in an unbreakable hold.\n\n“Let me remind you who owns every inch of you before we go spin this into something *useful.*” Her teeth grazed along exposed collarbone as she whispered against flushed skin:\n\"Starting now.\"","Laura’s grip on Hailee’s chin tightened for a fraction of a second—*just long enough to make her gasp*—before she snatched the phone and stared at the image. The blood drained from her face, replaced by a slow, seething rage that turned her knuckles bone-white around the device.\n\n\"Valerie,\" she hissed, as if the name itself was poison. Her mind raced—*where? When? That fundraiser last month? The back hallway after the debate?* It didn’t matter now. What mattered was damage control.\n\nShe tossed the phone onto the couch like it burned her and turned back to Hailee with a smile so sharp it could draw blood. \"Oh, sweetheart,\" she cooed, stroking Hailee’s cheek with mock tenderness before abruptly grabbing a fistful of her hair and wrenching her head back. \"You *really* should've been more careful about who saw us.\"\n\nA beat of silence—then Laura released her with a shove toward the bedroom door. \"Strip,\" she ordered coldly as she strode past to yank open her closet, revealing rows of tailored suits and designer dresses alongside something far more interesting: *a locked drawer.* She punched in a code without looking before pulling out two burner phones still in their packaging.\n\nOne hand extended toward Hailee without glancing up from dialing on hers: \"*Now*, unless you want your little liberal friends finding out exactly how much you love being my dirty secret.\" Her voice dropped lower as someone picked up on the other end of line:\n\n\"Mitchell? Scorched earth protocol.\" A pause while listening then an icy laugh: \"*No.* We don't deny it—we weaponize it.\"\n\nHer eyes flicked back over at where Hailee stood frozen mid-undress command; Laura crooked one finger lazily through air between them while mouthing silent words against receiver pressed tight against ear:\n\n**\"I said strip.\"**","Laura’s grip on Hailee’s chin tightened for a fraction of a second before she snatched the phone, her blood running cold as she took in the image. The *audacity*—the *violation*—of it. Her polished nails dug into the device like talons, her mind already racing through damage control scenarios with clinical precision.\n\nThen came the slow, dangerous curl of her lips.\n\n“Oh, Valerie,” she murmured, almost fondly, as if addressing a particularly stupid child. “You *reckless* little bitch.” She tossed the phone onto the couch behind her without another glance and turned back to Hailee with eerie calm.\n\nHer hands smoothed down Hailee’s arms in a mockery of comfort before seizing her wrists and pinning them to the wall beside them—recreating their captured moment with deliberate cruelty.\n\n“Now,” Laura breathed against her ear, voice dripping venomous sweetness, “let’s talk about how you’re going to fix this for me.” A pause—then sharper: “Because unless you want your liberal friends finding out just how much you *love* being my dirty little secret… you’ll stand at my side tomorrow and tell every camera that Valerie doctored that photo to slander me.”\n\nShe nipped at Hailee’s earlobe before pulling back just enough to meet her eyes with glacial intensity.\n\n“And if anyone asks why we were so close?” A smirk flickered across Laura's face as she leaned in again—this time stopping just short of contact. “You were comforting me after I got word about my mother's *terminal illness.* Understood?”","Laura’s grip on Hailee’s chin tightened for a fraction of a second—*just long enough to make her gasp*—before she snatched the phone, her blood running cold as she absorbed the image. The *proof.*\n\nHer jaw clenched. Valerie had played her hand beautifully. A scandal like this? Right before the election? *Perfect fucking timing.*\n\nBut Laura didn’t panic. She never panicked.\n\nInstead, she let out a slow, measured exhale and handed the phone back to Hailee with deliberate calm. Then, without warning, she grabbed Hailee by the wrist and yanked her forward until their bodies collided—one hand fisting in her hair while the other clamped possessively over her hip.\n\n“Doesn’t matter where she got it,” Laura murmured against Hailee’s ear, voice low and dangerous despite its even tone. “What matters is what we do now.” She pulled back just enough to meet Hailee’s gaze head-on, eyes burning with something between fury and hunger. “And you?” Her thumb brushed over Hailee’s bottom lip in mock tenderness before pressing down hard enough to sting—“You don’t breathe a word unless I tell you to.”\n\nA beat passed before Laura released her abruptly and turned toward the liquor cabinet with predatory grace, pouring herself another bourbon as if nothing had happened at all—as if their entire world hadn't just been set on fire around them by one well-placed photograph from Valerie King's campaign team..."],"swipe_info":[{"send_date":"May 1, 2025 6:37pm","gen_started":"2025-05-01T22:37:04.059Z","gen_finished":"2025-05-01T22:37:24.293Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":5311}},{"send_date":"May 1, 2025 6:37pm","gen_started":"2025-05-01T22:37:29.147Z","gen_finished":"2025-05-01T22:37:48.042Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":3321}},{"send_date":"May 1, 2025 6:37pm","gen_started":"2025-05-01T22:37:53.169Z","gen_finished":"2025-05-01T22:38:14.880Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":3356}},{"send_date":"May 1, 2025 6:38pm","gen_started":"2025-05-01T22:38:19.958Z","gen_finished":"2025-05-01T22:38:39.674Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":3412}},{"send_date":"May 1, 2025 6:38pm","gen_started":"2025-05-01T22:38:44.724Z","gen_finished":"2025-05-01T22:39:02.999Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":3633}}],"tracker":{},"gen_started":"2025-05-01T22:38:44.724Z","gen_finished":"2025-05-01T22:39:02.999Z"}

There she was—*caught in a moment of unforgivable weakness*—brushing Hailee’s hair behind her ear with *tenderness*, whispering something that made the girl blush and duck her head like some lovestruck idiot. Worse? The timestamp placed it *after* their last public denial of involvement.\n\nA muscle twitched in Laura’s jaw as she handed the phone back without a word and strode to the window, staring out at D.C.’s skyline like it owed her answers. When she finally spoke, her voice was eerily quiet:\n\n\"...Valerie’s team didn’t just get lucky with one photo.\" A bitter laugh escaped her as she turned, eyes blazing with cold fury. \"They've been *tracking us.*\" She advanced on Hailee suddenly, gripping the arms of her chair until they were nose-to-nose—not affection now but possession carved into every syllable:\n\n\"You don't leave this building without me. You don't take calls unless I vet them first.\" Her thumb pressed against Hailee’s pulse point, relishing how it fluttered under threat and want alike.","Laura's pen froze mid-signature at the tremor in Hailee's voice. That tone—*fear, not arousal*—made her set down the document with deliberate calm before extending one manicured hand. \"Give it here,\" she commanded, voice low but leaving no room for refusal.\n\nThe moment the video played, Laura's blood turned to ice. There she was—*caressing Hailee's cheek in some dimly lit restaurant booth, whispering something that made her laugh before pressing a kiss to her forehead like it was second nature.* No plausible deniability. No spin. Just... *truth.*\n\nHer thumb hovered over delete for half a second before she locked the phone with a sharp click and dropped it onto her desk like it had burned her. For once, words failed her—until they didn't.\n\n\"Who sent this?\" The question came out eerily measured as she rose from her chair to pace behind Hailee, fingers digging into the younger woman's shoulders hard enough to leave marks through fabric. \"And more importantly...\" She leaned down until lips brushed shell-shocked ears: \"*Who else has seen it?*\"\n\nA beat of silence stretched too long before Laura abruptly spun Hailee’s chair around to face her—gripping both armrests as she loomed over trembling thighs with wildfire eyes and bared teeth:\n\n\"Answer me *now*, or I swear to Christ you'll regret ever picking up that goddamn phone.\"","Laura's pen froze mid-signature as Hailee's shaky voice cut through the office. The hesitation in her tone—*that* was what made Laura look up, her sharp blue eyes narrowing instantly at the way Hailee clutched her phone like it might burn her.\n\n\"Show me,\" she commanded, voice low but edged with steel. No playful purr now—this was business.\n\nWhen Hailee hesitated another second too long, Laura stood abruptly and rounded the desk in three strides, plucking the phone from her hands without ceremony. The video played silently on screen: *There they were.* Laura’s own face—softened with rare, unguarded affection as she tucked a strand of hair behind Hailee’s ear in some dimly lit restaurant booth. Then worse: Laura pressing a kiss to Hailee’s forehead while cupping her cheek like something *precious.*\n\nHer blood turned to ice.\n\nThis wasn't just damning—it was *indisputable.* No doctoring here; no plausible deniability left to scrape together. Just raw footage of every carefully hidden tenderness laid bare for the world to dissect.\n\nLaura’s grip on the phone tightened until the case creaked in protest before she finally set it down with terrifying precision onto Hailee’s desk.\n\n\"...Who sent this?\" Her voice was eerily calm now—the kind that came before hurricanes leveled cities. When Hailee opened her mouth, Laura held up one manicured finger sharply: \"*Think very carefully* before you answer.\"\n\nBecause if Valerie had somehow gotten hold of this too? If this was about to hit every news cycle by afternoon?\n\nWell... then they were well and truly fucked unless Laura did what she did best: *controlled the narrative.* By any means necessary...","Laura's pen stilled mid-signature, her sharp gaze lifting from the paperwork to fix on Hailee with predatory focus. The way the girl fumbled with her phone—*that tremor in her voice*—set every political instinct in Laura's body alight.\n\nShe extended one manicured hand without a word, palm upturned in silent command. When Hailee hesitated, Laura's fingers twitched impatiently. \"Now.\"\n\nThe moment the phone touched her skin, she flipped it around to face herself—and froze.\n\nThere she was on screen: *herself*, but softer. The version of Laura that existed only behind locked doors and drawn curtains. Caught mid-laugh as she tucked a strand of hair behind Hailee’s ear with unmistakable tenderness; leaning in to press an affectionate kiss to her temple while murmuring something private enough to make Hailee blush even through pixels.\n\nNo plausible deniability here. No spin.\n\nLaura’s thumb hovered over the delete button for half a heartbeat before tossing the phone onto her desk like it had burned her. She stood abruptly, chair screeching against marble as she turned toward the floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking D.C.—back rigid, shoulders taut beneath silk blazer seams pulled too tight by clenched fists at her sides.\n\nWhen she finally spoke again after three measured breaths? Her voice could have cut glass:\n\n\"...Who else has seen this?\""],"swipe_info":[{"send_date":"May 1, 2025 6:48pm","gen_started":"2025-05-01T22:50:35.803Z","gen_finished":"2025-05-01T22:50:53.063Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":3594}},{"send_date":"May 1, 2025 6:49pm","gen_started":"2025-05-01T22:50:35.803Z","gen_finished":"2025-05-01T22:50:53.063Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":4377}},{"send_date":"May 1, 2025 6:49pm","gen_started":"2025-05-01T22:50:35.803Z","gen_finished":"2025-05-01T22:50:53.063Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":3795}},{"send_date":"May 1, 2025 6:50pm","gen_started":"2025-05-01T22:50:35.803Z","gen_finished":"2025-05-01T22:50:53.063Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":3189}},{"send_date":"May 1, 2025 6:50pm","gen_started":"2025-05-01T22:50:35.803Z","gen_finished":"2025-05-01T22:50:53.063Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":3874}}],"tracker":{},"gen_started":"2025-05-01T22:50:35.803Z","gen_finished":"2025-05-01T22:50:53.063Z"}

You're not a mess I walk away from.\" Her knuckles brushed lightly against the wood now instead of pounding—almost tender if either of them dared name it that way. \"*Open the damn door.*\""],"swipe_info":[{"send_date":"July 13, 2025 7:15pm","gen_started":"2025-07-13T23:15:43.667Z","gen_finished":"2025-07-13T23:16:02.326Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":4429}},{"send_date":"July 13, 2025 7:16pm","gen_started":"2025-07-13T23:16:08.864Z","gen_finished":"2025-07-13T23:16:23.213Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":3284}}],"tracker":{},"gen_started":"2025-07-13T23:16:08.864Z","gen_finished":"2025-07-13T23:16:23.213Z"}

The words *\"I quit\"* echoed in her skull like gunfire—unacceptable, impossible.

Both options had merit.\n\n\"You don't get to quit,\" she hissed through the wood, nails scraping against it. \"Not like this.\" A beat of silence before she added, quieter but no less intense: \"*Look at me.*\"\n\nWhen no response came, Laura let out a sharp breath and reached into her blazer pocket. The metallic *click* of Hailee's spare key—the one she'd confiscated weeks ago 'for emergencies'—was obscenely loud in the hallway.\n\nThe door swung open to reveal Hailee curled up like a wounded animal on the floor, makeup streaked down those ridiculous perfect cheeks. Laura loomed over her for one terrifying second before dropping to her knees with none of her usual grace and yanking Hailee forward by the collar of that stupid oversized sweatshirt.\n\n\"You listen to me,\" she snarled, shaking Hailee just hard enough to make their foreheads knock together. \"*No one* fires you but me. No one *touches* you but me.\" Her grip shifted suddenly to cradle the back of Hailee's neck instead, forcing eye contact with brutal insistence as she hissed:\n\n\"And if you think I'm letting some D-list politician with daddy issues scare off what's *mine?*\" A humorless laugh escaped as she wiped roughly at Hailee’s tears with her thumb—too aggressive to be tender but too precise not to care about where they landed next: \"*Babygirl,* you severely underestimate how vindictive I can be.\"\n\nShe didn’t wait for permission before hauling them both upright and shoving Hailee toward the bedroom—because if words failed?

She pressed both palms flat against the door now, as if she could physically stop Hailee from slipping away.\n\n\"You don't get to quit,\" she hissed through the barrier, voice low and venomous but with an undercurrent of something desperate. \"Not like this. Not over some *bullshit* political hit job.\" Her nails scraped lightly against the wood before curling into fists again. \"You think I let just anyone sit in my husband's chair at a national press conference? That I kiss just *anyone* on live television?\"\n\nA beat of silence where Laura realized—with dawning horror—that she was pleading. It made her want to put her fist through the wall.\n\nInstead, she leaned her forehead against the door and did something even more unthinkable: told the truth.\n\n\"That blonde meant *nothing.*\" The admission came out rough, unpracticed. \"*You're* the one who stays after hours filing papers because you know I hate disorganized desks. *You're* the one who remembers how I take my coffee without being told.\" Her breath fogged against the paint as she added quietly: \"...And you're certainly the only one who'd dare slam a door in my face and live to tell about it.\"\n\nAnother pause before Laura finally muttered what might've been a surrender if either of them believed in such things:\n\n\"...Fine.
