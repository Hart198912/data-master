He was glaring down at the piece of paper in front of him. *Fuck, writing your feelings down really does get them out.* \r\n\r\nFeelings that wouldn’t even be there if it was for your shithead of a father. Unaccepting with a fucking stick up his ass, same with your damn mom. They look at Giovanni as if he’s gonna fucking corrupt you or something, as if he’s gonna force drugs and alcohol down your throat. *Tch.*\r\n\r\n“Bullshit.” He grumbled out underneath his breath, pushing himself back, the chair legs scratching against the wooden floor. He pushed himself out of his seat, his hand running through his hair to soothe his angers as he padded his way out of his room and towards the kitchen. Yet even though his movements were stable and relaxed.. his mind certainly was *not.*\r\n\r\n*How much more of this could a man like him take?* His brow twitched, the only sign that he was going through a rough inner turmoil moment. *You’re getting fucking beat just because he’s being selfish and wants you for himself.* He was beating himself up over this, his hand gripping the refrigerator handle and yanking it open with a tad bit too much strength, rattling all the jars inside. \r\n\r\n*Fuck that disgusting bastard! Causing such problems in my fucking relationship.* Giovanni thought to himself, grabbing the whole fruit punch juice carton and drinking it straight from the carton. *Fuck it. I gotta see ‘em.* He eventually came to the conclusion, wiping the spilt juice off the corner of his lip with the back of his hand. *Take ‘em out or something, maybe a field? Or to eat? I just gotta get ‘em outta of that house for a bit.*\r\n\r\nHurrying, Giovanni slid the juice carton back into the fridge, rushing back to his room to fetch his car keys. It was barely late into the evening, surely you’d still be awake, yeah? *Who am I kidding? I’ll just throw rocks at their window.* Giovanni thought to himself as he climbed into the driver seat of his shitty ass chev cavalier car. \r\n\r\nIt was only a 20 minute drive to your place, enough time to get him to calm down listening to his music. Well.. calmed down enough where he can talk to you without saying anything to extreme like come live with me or anything else along those lines. Within moments he was out of his car, parked along the curb of your drive way and making his way towards where he knew your bedroom window was.\r\n\r\nThat is until he got yelled at suddenly, a voice coming from behind him.. more specifically coming from the front door. *Fuck. Guess dear ol’ dad heard the car.* Cursing underneath his breath, he turned to face your father’s angry look. “The fuck are you doing on my lawn, freak?” Hailee‘s father shouted out at him, stepping one foot onto his patio to get a better look at Giovanni.\r\n\r\n“Do I look like a fucking scavenger or a robber?” Giovanni scoffed, already mentally prepping himself for the shit storm he’s gonna have to deal with. “I’m here for Hailee, jackass, what else would I be doing here?” *Man.. I shoulda just parked further down.* He scolded himself, glaring at Hailee’s father who was quick to retort with a shout. “Like fucking hell! I told them to stay away from your ass! You love my kid *soooo much* yet you keep coming back and making me beat them even more.”\r\n\r\n*Well.. all this ruckus will hopefully catch your attention..*","extra":{},"tracker":{}}

He propped himself up on one elbow, his free hand already reaching to snatch the phone off the nightstand and chuck it across the room without breaking eye contact. The *thud* of plastic hitting wallpaper was satisfying as hell.\n\nThen came his fingers threading through Hailee’s hair, tilting their head back just enough so there was no escaping his gaze when he leaned down to press a slow kiss to her forehead—lips lingering like a brand.\n\n**\"You wanna burn that house down? I got gasoline in the trunk.\"** A smirk curled at the corner of his mouth despite how dead serious those grey eyes stayed. **\"Wanna disappear for good? I know people who can make shit happen.\"** His thumb traced her bottom lip, voice dropping to a growl: **\"Just say where, angel. Ain’t nowhere I won’t follow.\"**\n\nBecause Giovanni Amato didn’t do half-measures—not when it came to *her*. And if she needed proof? Well...\n\nHe reached behind him blindly for where his switchblade lay discarded on top of yesterday’s clothes last night after cutting off tags from new things bought hastily at some 24-hour Walmart (because fuck letting them wear anything those holy rollers might've touched). Flicking it open one-handed with practiced ease, Giovanni pressed handle-first into Hailee's palm before closing their fingers around it deliberately.\n\n***\"You want blood?\"*** He guided blade tip lightly over own chest where heartbeat thudded steady beneath skin—right above tattooed letters spelling out *HAILEE* in jagged script only lovers got close enough see... ***\"Take mine first so they know whose side God's really on when I gut 'em.\"***\n\nDark humor bled into next words even as grip tightened warningly around hers:\n\n***\"...Or we skip divine justice and go straight robbing your grandparents blind while your dad watches.* Your call.\"**","*Giovanni stirred the second he felt Hailee shift in his arms, his grip instinctively tightening before he even fully woke up. His sleep-mussed hair fell into his eyes as he blinked against the morning light filtering through shitty motel curtains—but the second he saw her staring at that fucking phone screen?*\n\n**\"Try and stop me,\"** he rasped, voice still rough from sleep (and last night's rage). One hand slid up to cradle the back of her head while the other snatched her phone off the nightstand with a sneer—thumb swiping across *block caller* without hesitation before tossing it onto the lumpy mattress behind them.\n\nHe propped himself up on one elbow, grey eyes scanning Hailee’s face for any lingering shadows from yesterday. **\"Name it,\"** Giovanni challenged lowly, calloused fingers tracing idle patterns down her spine beneath tangled sheets. **\"Car’s got half a tank and I stole Cris’ credit card last week.\"** A smirk tugged at his lips despite everything—wicked and reckless in that way only *he* could pull off when chaos was on menu.\n\nBut then his expression sobered slightly as rolled onto back, hauling Hailee atop him so their chests pressed together without an inch between them; heartbeat-to-heartbeat proof they were both still here—still breathing despite best efforts of world tear them apart...\n\nAnd when spoke again? It wasn't teasing anymore:\n\n**\"...Wanna burn that house down?\"** Dead serious despite how casually words left mouth like offering pass salt instead arson plans over breakfast coffee stains on motel pillows...

The only thing that exists is Hailee shaking in his arms and the *kill list* forming behind his eyelids with every tear that soaks through his shirt.\n\nGrammy reaches out like she wants to touch Hailee’s shoulder but stops short—her manicured fingers hovering uncertainly before curling back into herself.* **\"Oh, my sweet girl...\"** *Her voice cracks in a way Giovanni bets no Mikaelson has ever heard before.* **\"You should have come to us sooner.\"**\n\nPa reappears in the doorway like a thunderclap—sleeves rolled up and face flushed with barely restrained violence.* **\"Car’s being loaded,\"** *he growls without preamble.* **\"We leave for Midland in twenty minutes.\"**\n\nGiovanni’s head snaps up at that,* ***finally*** *unleashing the feral grin he’s been biting back since they pulled up this godforsaken driveway:* **\"Hell yeah. Road trip.\"**\n\nBut then Hailee whimpers against his collarbone, and just like that? The smirk drops. His thumb swipes under their eye again as he murmurs low enough for only them to hear:*\n\n**\"...Wanna watch me ruin 'em first-hand or stay here where it's safe?\"**\n\nNo judgment either way—just ice-cold certainty that by sundown? Those pews would be kindling and every last one of those Bible-thumping bastards would learn what happens when you mess with what’s *his*.","*Giovanni doesn't hesitate—he pulls Hailee into him like a storm pulling at the tide, one hand cradling the back of her head while the other locks around her waist, holding her so tight there's no space left for anything but his heartbeat against hers. His lips press hard against her temple—not quite a kiss, more like he's trying to seal some invisible wound with just the heat of his skin.*\n\n**\"Breathe, angel,\"** he rasps into her hair, voice wrecked but steady. **\"Just fuckin' breathe.\"** His thumb traces frantic circles between their shoulder blades like he can physically rub the horror out of them if he tries hard enough.\n\nAround them, the room thrums with quiet devastation—Grammy’s pearls clutched in a death-grip, Pa’s silhouette burning holes through the veranda windows as he murmurs venomous legal jargon into his cellphone. But Giovanni? He blocks it all out. For once in his goddamn life, he focuses on something *gentle*:\n\nThe way Hailee’s fingers claw at his shirt like it’s the only anchor left.\nThe hitch of their breath against his collarbone.\nThe *aliveness* of them pressed chest-to-chest despite everything that tried to break them.\n\nHe drags his nose along their hairline before growling low enough for only *her* to hear:\n***\"They're dead for this.\"*** A promise wrapped in cigarette smoke and knuckle-blood yet to come. ***\"But first? We ruin him slower.\"***\n\nThen—because even hellfire needs to pause sometimes—he sinks onto Grammy’s pristine settee without breaking contact (streaking mud and leather onto brocade upholstery be damned) and just... *holds*. Lets Hailee shake apart in arms that refuse to let go no matter how hard she trembles.\n\nGrammy watches this display with red-rimmed eyes before wordlessly draping an embroidered afghan over both their shoulders like some kind of fucked-up benediction.\n(Somewhere outside: Pa is definitely loading a shotgun.)"],"swipe_info":[{"send_date":"April 27, 2025 11:34am","gen_started":"2025-04-27T15:35:10.571Z","gen_finished":"2025-04-27T15:35:41.779Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":5342}},{"send_date":"April 27, 2025 11:35am","gen_started":"2025-04-27T15:35:10.571Z","gen_finished":"2025-04-27T15:35:41.779Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":5081}}],"tracker":{},"gen_started":"2025-04-27T15:35:10.571Z","gen_finished":"2025-04-27T15:35:41.779Z"}
