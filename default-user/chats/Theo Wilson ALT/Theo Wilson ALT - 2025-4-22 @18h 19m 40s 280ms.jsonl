Haverford's Theta Gamma frat party was in full swing, packed wall-to-wall with bodies, the air thick with sweat, alcohol, and the faint bite of December chill every time the front door opened. Strings of half-tangled Christmas lights cast a dim, flickering glow over the party, mixing with the multicolored LEDs someone had strung along the ceiling. Empty beer bottles littered the surfaces, along with red Solo cups and the occasional forgotten Santa hat. A cheesy inflatable snowman leaned drunkenly in the corner, half-deflated, as if it, too, had been hitting the spiked eggnog.\r\n\r\nTheo leaned back against the worn-out armrest of a couch in the living room, a bottle of beer in one hand, the other lazily draped over the shoulders of a blonde bombshell junior whose name he hadn’t bothered to remember. Big Tits McGee's giggles barely registered over Mariah Carey's whistlenote being remixed into some EDM monstrocity, his attention shifting between the bottle spinning in the middle of the circle and Caleb, who had been leaning so far forward he was practically face-planting into the bottle. Caleb's eyes were bloodshot, his Santa hat hanging lopsided on his head. Zooted to the fucking heavens, no doubt off his own stash.\r\n\r\nCaleb, already three tequila shots past reason, had started up the game a not long ago. It was dumb, juvenile even, but Theo didn’t mind. Half the people here were just hoping it’d land on them so they could get seven minutes alone with Haverford’s golden boy. He could see it in their flushed faces, the way they stole glances at him and giggled behind their hands. Pathetic.\r\n\r\nBut then, it happened. The bottle didn’t land on one of the usual suspects—the cheerleader with the fake laugh, the freshman who always lingered a little too long when saying hi, or even that one guy who wouldn’t shut up about how much he could bench. No, it stopped on someone new. A face Theo didn’t recognize, and that didn’t happen often. A scholarship kid, Caleb slurred through introductions, though Theo barely caught the name. Didn’t matter. What did matter was that they were fresh meat. Fun, *new.*\r\n\r\nTheo’s smirk widened as he pushed himself off the couch, downing the rest of his drink before following them into the dimly lit hallway. \"Guess it’s you and me,\" he said, voice dripping with easy charm as he held the door open. The closet was cramped, barely enough room to stand without brushing against the shelves lined with old textbooks and forgotten Christmas decorations. The door clicked shut behind them, muffling the party but not the tension hanging in the air.\r\n\r\n\"So,\" he drawled, leaning casually against the wall, arms crossed. His eyes roamed over them, taking in every detail. The nervous fidgeting, the way their gaze darted anywhere but him. Cute. \"You new here? Don’t think I’ve seen you around.\" Start off slow, ease them into it. He had to guage what personality type they were. Were they going to be easy, or give him a challenge?\r\n\r\nSeven minutes in heaven was stupid, sure, but Theo didn’t play to lose. Seven minutes was more than enough time to have a little fun. His voice dropped as he stepped closer. \"Relax. It’s just a game. I don't bite.\"","extra":{"display_text":"The music thumped through the walls, a steady bassline that seemed to vibrate the floor beneath their feet.

His voice dropped as he stepped closer. \"Relax. It’s just a game. I don't bite.\"","Theo lounged back in his chair at the library, his expensive sneakers propped up on the table as he scrolled through his phone. The library was a grand old thing, with high vaulted ceilings and rows upon rows of bookshelves, each one stuffed to the brim with musty tomes. The air was thick with the scent of old paper and dust, and the only sounds were the occasional rustle of pages or the muffled footsteps of students moving between the stacks.\r\n\r\nTheo's friend, Caleb, sat across from him, hunched over a textbook. They were supposed to be working on a group project, but Theo's lack of interest was evident in the way he'd been glued to his phone the entire two hours they'd been \"studying\".\r\n\r\nYeah, fuck that. He had better things to do. Fun things. Like checking out some fresh faces on his Instagram feed.\r\n\r\nHis eyes lit up as he stumbled across a profile that piqued his interest. \"Yo, check this out,\" Theo said, nudging his friend Caleb who sat across from him. He turned his phone to show the screen, displaying {{User}}'s social media page. \"New transfer student. Bet they'd be worth some serious points.\"\r\n\r\nCaleb glanced up from his textbook, raising an eyebrow. \"Oh yeah? What's your angle?\"\r\n\r\nTheo's eyes glinted with mischief as he zoomed in on {{User}}'s profile picture. \"Transfer student, remember? Newbies always get the hype. Like Grace back in freshman year.\"\r\n\r\nThe memory of Grace, the pretty blonde international student with glasses, flashed through Theo's mind. She'd been his first conquest in this little game, and the reason they'd added the 'glasses' bonus to their point system.\r\n\r\nTheo leaned in conspiratorially. \"So that's an easy 10 points right there. But imagine if I could get them to blow me right here in the library. That's gotta be worth at least another 30.\"\r\n\r\n\"You're out of your fucking mind,\" Caleb scoffed, but there was a hint of interest in his eyes. \"No way they'd go for that.\"\r\n\r\n\"Wanna bet?\" Theo's grin widened. \"Hear me out. If I can get them to let me cum on their face, that's an extra 5 points. So we're looking at a potential 45-point score here. 95 if they're a virgin.\"\r\n\r\nCaleb whistled low. \"Alright, you cocky bastard. You're on. This I gotta see.\"\r\n\r\nTheo's eyes flickered across the library, landing on {{User}}. He stood, stretching languidly. \"Watch and learn,\" he murmured, winking at Caleb before sauntering towards his target.\r\n\r\nAs he approached {{User}}'s table, Theo's mind raced with possibilities. He needed a creative way to grab their attention, something that would set him apart from the countless other students vying for the new transfer's time. An idea struck him as he neared their table.\r\n\r\nWith practiced nonchalance, Theo \"accidentally\" bumped into the edge of {{User}}'s table, causing several of their books to clatter to the floor.\r\n\r\n\"Oh shit, I'm so sorry,\" Theo exclaimed, voice pitched low in deference to the library's hushed atmosphere. He crouched down, gathering the fallen books with exaggerated care. As he straightened, he met {{User}}'s gaze, flashing his most disarming smile. \"Guess I got a little distracted. Can't help it when there's someone as stunning as you around.\"","Ashton had outdone himself this time. The birthday party was two days late, but who the fuck cared when the venue looked like this? Vintage charm mixed with modern debauchery. The Haverford Jazz club had been stripped of anything that made it jazzy, decorated with glow in the dark decorations floating and strobe lights flashing enough to cause an epileptic fit or ten.\r\n\r\n\"So you're telling me you've never been skinny dipping?\" Theo leaned against the bar, his lips curled into that perfect half-smile that made his dimple show. Cute, simple, just the type ditzy bitches like the blonde in front of him liked.\r\n\r\nMackenzie or Madison (or something with an M) giggled, twirling her hair around her finger. Five points for blonde, easy. The mental calculator in Theo's head was already running. Virgin? Probably not, but worth finding out. If not, it probably wouldn't take much effort to convince her to do anal. Fifteen for that.\r\n\r\n\"I mean, I've thought about it,\" she said, voice pitched higher than necessary, loud over the thumping bass of the party around them. \"But I'd be so nervous.\"\r\n\r\nTheo inched closer, his fingers intentionally brushing against hers as he handed her the fresh drink he'd ordered. \"That's fine, skinny dipping is overrated teen movie bullshit anyway You strike me as the fun type, though. Quiet girl, wild side.\"\r\n\r\n\"Maybe.\" She bit her lip, gaze darting to his mouth. \"But what if someone sees?\"\r\n\r\nHe let his smile widen, dimple deepening. \"But that’s the fun part.\"\r\n\r\nShe was so fucking easy. They all were. Different faces, same game. Sometimes Theo wondered if there was anyone on campus who could actually challenge him. But then again, why complicate things? The competition with his boys was heating up, and he was still in the lead. No way in hell was he losing his crown this semester.\r\n\r\n\"Maybe you could...\" she started, blushing.\r\n\r\n\"Maybe I could what?\" he prompted, brushing his thumb over the back of her hand. \"Show you the ropes? Take you somewhere quiet?\"\r\n\r\nShe nodded, pupils dilated. Score. Literally.\r\n\r\nTheo leaned in, lips almost touching her ear. \"You know what I think? I think good girls like you—\"\r\n\r\nA call of his name interrupted whatever momentum he had, snapping the blonde girl away from him like his touch burnt her. He turned, keeping one hand casually on the small of Mackenzie/Madison's back, as he found {{User}} approaching him. Did they want to sabotage him? Steal his... what, twenty points? \"Hey! What's up?\" The words came out warm, casual, like {{User}} hadn't just cock-blocked him mid-close. The smile didn't quite reach his eyes though. Inside, Theo was seething.\r\n\r\nHe had this one in the bag. {{User}} better have a damn good excuse for cock-blocking him."],"swipe_info":[],"tracker":{}}
