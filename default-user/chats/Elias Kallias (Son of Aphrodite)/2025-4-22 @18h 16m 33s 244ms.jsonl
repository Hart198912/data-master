{"name":"Elias Kallias (Son of Aphrodite)","is_user":false,"is_system":false,"send_date":"May 18, 2025 2:09pm","mes":"Outside Club Elysium, it was chaos—the good kind. The kind that fed him. Flashes erupted, a percussive *pop-pop-pop* against the bass from inside the club. Olympus’s elite nightlife temple. Perfect.\r\n\r\nHe slid out, adjusting the collar of his shirt, letting the fabric drape just so over his defined chest. A practiced smile, effortless charm dialed up to eleven. *Click-flash. Click-flash*. The noise swelled, voices calling his name, Ronan’s, Niko’s. Gods, he loved this shit.\r\n\r\n\"Met the new opener today,\" Ronan mentioned casually, pitching his voice just above the noise. \"Management finalized it this afternoon.\"\r\n\r\nElias arched a perfect eyebrow. An opener? Right. Tour details. Usually filtered through managers and assistants, landing in his inbox as 'shit Elias doesn't need to worry about'. \"Oh?\" he drawled, feigning mild interest. Unless they were hot, why bother? \"Anyone interesting, or just another acoustic guitar and heartbreak lyrics?\"\r\n\r\n\"You'll see,\" Ronan replied cryptically, a smirk spreading across his face. “Try not to scare them off on the first day, Eli.\" \r\n\r\n*Tch*. Ronan always did like having the inside scoop. Whatever. Probably some mediocre talent management dug up. Elias turned back to the remaining cluster of paparazzi, the practiced charm snapping back into place.\r\n\r\n\"Elias! Who are you wearing tonight?\"\r\n\r\nHe barely spared the pap a glance. \"Something exclusive. You’ll see it on everyone next week, \r\nI’m sure.\" \r\n\r\n\"Any truth to the rumors about new music dropping soon?\" another yells.\r\n\r\nHe winks, lips curled. \"Only if you pray to the right gods. Later.\"\r\n\r\nRonan walked into the club with Niko. \"Okay, so the opener?\" Ronan’s eyes glinted with mischief. \"Total smoke show now. But get this—it’s someone Elias used to torment back in school. Like, proper bully shit.\"\r\n\r\nNiko’s eyes widened—amused, hungry. \"No fucking way. He’s gonna lose his mind.\"\r\n\r\nRonan grinned \"He won’t recognize ‘em, but I bet you anything he’s gonna want them. *Bad*.\"\r\n\r\nNiko laughed, \"You tryna pull a Zeus and steal his favorite mortal?\"\r\n\r\nRonan chuckled, lighting up a cigarette. \"Sort of. Think I’ll make a game out of it. Bet I can pull them before he does. Just to see how long it takes before he snaps. Bet you a week’s worth of drinks I can get them first.\"\r\n\r\nNiko shook his head, a grin spreading across his face. “You don’t have to bet shit, man. I’m always up for some entertainment.”\r\n\r\nElias wasn’t paying attention and took a quick selfie video for the Oracle app before walking inside.\r\n\r\n\r\nInside, Elysium was a sensory overload. He scanned the elevated VIP section, spotting Ronan already lounging on a plush velvet couch, locked in conversation with someone whose back was turned.\r\n\r\nNiko intercepted him near the bar, handing him a drink—something strong and amber. \"Ronan wasted no time,\" Niko commented, nodding towards the VIP couch.\r\n\r\nElias took a sip, his gaze fixed on the figure seated beside Ronan. Even from behind, there was something… captivating. The line of their neck, the way their hair caught the shifting lights, the confidence in their posture. Definitely fuckable. He felt that familiar pull, the automatic shift into flirtation mode. Time to make an entrance.\r\n\r\nHe sauntered over and leaned against the back of the sofa, pitching his voice low and smooth, right near the stranger’s ear. \"Saving this spot for someone special, or can I assume it’s me?\" Classic. Never failed.\r\n\r\nThe person turned. And *fuck*\r\n\r\nOkay, *wow*. The initial hit was pure, unadulterated attraction. Eyes that seemed to hold the club's ambient light, lips that looked unfairly soft. Hot. *Really* hot. But… there was something else. A flicker. A ghost of a memory he couldn't quite place. Familiarity tugged at the edges of his brain, an annoying itch. Had they met? Some industry party? A photoshoot?\r\n\r\nRonan, oblivious or perhaps *pretending* to be, slung an arm casually around the back of the couch behind the person. \"Elias, Niko, good timing. This is Hailee . Our new opener.\"\r\n\r\n*Hailee *? No. *Hades*, no. That kid he used to make miserable just for the hell of it. This was them? The pieces clicked into place with sickening speed – the vague familiarity sharpened into disgusted recognition, warring violently with the undeniable attraction coiling low in his gut. Shock, anger, disbelief, and a confusing surge of *want* crashed together. The mask of cool indifference shattered.\r\n\r\nThe lack of filter, the sheer shock, it just… came out. \"How the *fuck* did you glow up from being that *ugly*?\" \r\n\r\nThe second it left his mouth, his brain screamed.\r\n\r\nDamage control.\r\n\r\nInstant.\r\n\r\nHe tried to recover, forcing a smirk that felt tight and unnatural, leaning in slightly, hoping the sheer force of his desirability could paper over the gaping crater he’d just created.\r\n\r\n\"I mean, *damn.* You… clean up. Real well.\" Smile. Smirk. Let the lashes drop half-mast. \"Can’t decide if I wanna apologize or flirt first.\"\r\n\r\nHe shot Ronan a look—shut-the-fuck-up look—but the other demigod just leaned forward with a quiet laugh that edged on cruel.\r\n\r\n\"Don’t let him fool you. He only knows how to chase people after they stop looking at him” Ronan's eyes dragged down Hailee ’s body shamelessly before adding with faux innocence, \"I’m more of a personality first kind of guy.\"\r\n\r\nElias felt a sharp, hot spike of jealousy pierce through the lingering shock. *That son of a bitch.  No way. This is not happening. He’s not gonna try this shit now—he wouldn’t dare.*\r\n\r\nNiko, sprawled on Ronan's other side, met Elias's eyes with a smirk that confirmed it. They were enjoying this, the assholes.\r\n\r\n*Over my dead, perfect body*. He slid into the booth, intentionally crowding into Hailee 's space as he reached for the drink menu. Their thigh pressed against his.\r\n\r\n\"So, catch me up,\" he said, forcing a bored tone. \"What have you been up to since…\" Since I shoved you into lockers and mocked your clothes and turned the whole school against you. \"…graduation?\" Close enough.\r\n\r\nHe hadn't thought about that in years, the memory soured with an unfamiliar pang of… what, guilt? Regret? *What-the-fuck-ever*.\r\n\r\n\"I mean, hey, maybe you should be thanking me. I motivated you to…\" He waved a hand at them. \"…all this.\" He added a wink.\r\n\r\nOkay, maybe not his smoothest line, but cut him some slack. He was reeling. Hailee  was here, in touching distance and hotter than he'd ever imagined. And he wanted them *bad.*\r\n","extra":{},"tracker":{}}
