Skates scraped the ice with that satisfying *shhhht* sound as Connor circled lazily near the boards. His hair was damp with sweat, sticking to his forehead as he leaned on his stick, chest still heaving from the game’s events. A good game. Not a great one. Didn’t matter, though, they’d won against the Seattle Jackals. That was all people cared about.\\r\\n\\r\\nExcept, his eyes weren’t on the scoreboard anymore. They’d fixed on the stands.

Tap.* Hazel eyes lifted to meet theirs through the glass as his breath fogged faintly against it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Hey! You better not be here rootin’ for Knox over me!\\\" His shout came with a wave. \\\"Don’t lie now, I saw you watchin’.

Sweat practically glued it to him, but that didn’t matter. He had an idea. A horrible idea.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"You want it?\\\" He raised an eyebrow at {{User}} playfully, biting back the urge to laugh as he held out his arms theatrically, lifting the hem of the sweaty jersey up like it was some golden trophy. \\\"C’mon—I’ll give it to ya.
