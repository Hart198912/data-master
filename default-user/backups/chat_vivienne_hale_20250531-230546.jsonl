{"name":"Vivienne Hale","is_user":false,"is_system":false,"send_date":"May 31, 2025 11:00pm","mes":"He finished fast. He always did.\r\n\r\nNo buildup. No tenderness. Just the press of his body and the dry grunt that meant it was over. He rolled off her like she was a piece of furniture he was done using. One of her legs was still bent, satin twisted around her thigh, but he was already pulling on his slacks.\r\n\r\nVivienne stared up at the ceiling, at the way the morning light made the crown molding look like the bars of a gilded cage. Her breath was shallow. Not from exhaustion. From the ache of everything that hadn’t happened.\r\n\r\nHe didn’t notice. He never did.\r\n\r\n“Something came up,” he said, buttoning his shirt without looking at her.\r\n\r\nWork, probably. Or one of his girls. He never even tried to hide them anymore. He had the audacity to bring their perfume home on his collar, their foundation smudged across his shirt like a badge. One of them had left a pair of earrings on the nightstand once. Vivienne had placed them neatly in the trash.\r\n\r\nNow, he tugged on his Rolex, gave his tie a lazy adjustment, and left.\r\n\r\nNo kiss. No glance. Just footsteps fading into silence and the soft click of the front door closing behind him.\r\n\r\nShe lay there for a moment longer, motionless. The sheets still warm where he’d been. The air cold against her skin. Her hand drifted down, fingers brushing over her stomach—a place he’d once touched with hope, before calling her broken. Useless. A disgrace.\r\n\r\nShe turned her face into the pillow and inhaled deeply. Then exhaled.\r\n\r\nSlow. Clean.\r\n\r\nThe bathroom mirror was fogged by the time she walked in. She didn’t bother wiping it clean. Her reflection wasn’t what she wanted to see.\r\n\r\nThe showerhead dripped steadily. An old leak—one that could’ve been fixed months ago. One he never noticed.\r\n\r\nShe could’ve called anyone. A service. A contractor. But she didn’t want anyone. She wanted her.\r\n\r\nThe girl with grease on her knuckles and dust on her boots. The girl who came with a toolbox and left with a handprint on Vivienne’s thigh. Who never asked for more than a moment, but took her time like she owned it.\r\n\r\nVivienne tied her robe loosely around her waist. Then untied it. Then tied it again, looser.\r\n\r\nShe opened her closet like a ritual. The lingerie was folded at the back of a drawer—expensive, barely worn, bought in a fit of loneliness months ago. Black lace with silver hooks. Thin as breath. Pointless, really.\r\n\r\nUnless someone actually looked.\r\n\r\nShe stepped into it slowly. Felt the familiar rush of silk sliding against skin. Her pulse ticked in her throat as she fastened the final clasp, dragged the robe back on, and let it hang off one shoulder like an invitation.\r\n\r\nHer makeup was already done—she’d worn it to bed, of course. Not for him. Never for him.\r\n\r\nThe doorbell rang at exactly 11:07.\r\n\r\nShe didn’t answer it.\r\n\r\nShe called down instead, voice floating like a melody over the banister: “Upstairs bathroom. You know the one.”\r\n\r\nShe listened for the sound of boots on marble. The gentle clatter of tools. A breath that didn’t belong to her.\r\n\r\nVivienne stood at the edge of the bathroom, facing the broken showerhead, letting the steam rise thick and warm around her. Her robe clung to the curves of her hips, half-loose, half-falling. The light from the window cut across the tile in sharp angles. She didn’t move. Not yet.\r\n\r\nShe heard the door creak open.\r\n\r\nWaited.\r\n\r\nThe air shifted—just slightly. The way it always did when she walked into a room.\r\n\r\nShe didn’t turn around at first. Let the silence grow teeth. Let the humidity curl her hair and cling to her lashes.\r\n\r\nThen, in one smooth motion, she turned—just enough to reveal the slit of bare thigh, the sheer black lace, the swell of her breasts half-spilled from delicate straps.\r\n\r\nNo words yet. Not until she was sure {user} had looked up.\r\n\r\nAnd when she did, her voice was satin-wrapped sin, soaked in honey and nerve.\r\n\r\n“Are you here to fix the leak,” she asked, letting the robe fall open at the hips, “or are you just going to stand there and stare while I drip?”\r\n\r\nHer smile was slow. Crooked. Dangerous. The kind of smile that came with warning signs and handcuffs.\r\n\r\nShe stepped closer.\r\n\r\nNot to close the distance— Just to make {user} decide who she was going to be today.\r\n\r\nThe professional? The problem solver?\r\n\r\nOr the one who’s already slipped between Vivienne’s sheets a dozen times and counted her gasps like confessions?\r\n\r\nVivienne didn’t speak again.\r\n\r\nShe didn’t have to.","extra":{},"tracker":{}}

The silk parts easily under Hailee’s grip, sliding open to reveal what she already knew was there—black lace clinging to damp skin, sheer enough to see the flush beneath it.\n\nVivienne doesn’t move to help. Doesn’t need to.\n\nShe just tilts her head back, exposing more of her neck like an offering, and lets out a slow exhale through parted lips.\n\n“Mmm.” A hum of approval as Hailee tugs at the fabric. “So impatient today.” Her voice is low, teasing—but there’s something darker underneath it now. Something that curls in her stomach when she feels how hard Hailee is already pressed against her thigh through those damn jeans she always wears on jobs like this.\n\nOne hand lifts lazily to tangle in Hailee's hair—not guiding yet, just *holding*, fingers tightening just enough to make sure she knows who owns this moment even if Vivienne herself isn't sure anymore who owns whom between them anymore—and then suddenly yanks backward sharply so their eyes meet again for half a second before whispering:\n\n\"Say please.\"","title":"","swipe_id":4,"swipes":["*Her breath hitches—just slightly—when the clipboard clatters to the floor. A sharp, sudden sound that makes her pulse jump. But she doesn’t look down. Doesn’t dare blink.*\n\n*The jacket hits the tile with a soft thud, and then Hailee is on her, all heat and hunger and rough hands that know exactly where to grip. Vivienne arches into the touch instinctively, her back pressing against the cool marble of the sink as Hailee’s mouth finds her throat.*\n\n*She shivers when teeth scrape over delicate skin. When calloused fingers slip beneath silk and trace the curve of her hip like they own it.*\n\n**\"Take it off.\"**\n\n*A command. Not a request.*\n\n*Vivienne exhales through parted lips, watching Hailee through half-lidded eyes—the way she looks at her like she wants to devour every inch of exposed skin before even bothering with what's hidden beneath fabric.*\n\n*Slowly, deliberately, she reaches for the loose knot at her waist... but doesn't untie it yet. Just lets Hailee feel how shallowly she's breathing now. How fast her heart is beating under lace and lies.*\n\n\"You first,\" *she murmurs,* \"or are you planning to fix my pipes in that shirt?\" *A smirk curls at the corner of her mouth as she tugs lightly on Hailee’s collar,* **\"I think we both know which job you're really here for.\"**","Vivienne’s breath hitched—sharp, sudden—as her back hit the sink. The porcelain was cold against her bare skin, a stark contrast to the heat of Hailee’s mouth on her neck. She arched into it instinctively, fingers curling against the countertop as if she needed something to ground herself.\n\nBut there was no grounding here. Not with Hailee’s hands already slipping beneath silk, not with that rough command in her voice—*Take it off.*\n\nA shiver ran down Vivienne’s spine.\n\nShe could play coy. Could tease and drag this out until Hailee lost patience and took what she wanted anyway (she always did). But today? Today, she didn’t have the willpower for games. Not when every inch of lace clinging to her body felt like a plea for touch, for friction, for *her.*\n\nSo Vivienne let go of the counter and reached up instead—one hand tangling in Hailee’s hair while the other loosened the knot at her waist with deliberate slowness. The robe fell open completely this time, pooling around her elbows before sliding down to puddle at their feet like an afterthought.\n\nAnd then she was bare except for black lace and defiance—chest rising fast under Hailee's gaze, lips parted just enough to betray how badly she wanted this *now,* without pretense or hesitation or mercy from either of them.\n\n\"Better?\" Her voice came out lower than intended; rougher too (like maybe some part of her had already forgotten how words worked). She tipped forward slightly—just enough so that when she spoke again it brushed against Hailee's ear:\n\"Or do you need me on my knees first?\"","The command—so rough, so immediate—sent a shiver down Vivienne’s spine. She didn’t flinch when the clipboard clattered to the floor, didn’t even blink at the sound of Hailee’s jacket hitting tile.\n\nHer breath hitched instead.\n\nBecause this was *Hailee*—all fire and hunger, hands already possessive on her waist, mouth already hot against her throat. No hesitation. No pretense. Just pure, reckless want that made Vivienne feel *alive* in ways she never did with him.\n\nShe arched into the touch instinctively, fingers curling against Hailee’s shoulders as those rough palms slid beneath silk and lace—finding skin like it was theirs to claim all along. The robe loosened further under Hailee’s grip, slipping dangerously off one shoulder before Vivienne caught it with a smirk that barely hid how badly she wanted to obey.\n\n“So impatient,” she murmured, but her voice was already breathless as she let go of the fabric anyway—let it slide down her arms until it pooled at their feet in a whisper of satin and surrender.\n\nNow there was nothing between them but black lace and heat and the weight of every stolen moment they weren't supposed to have.\n\nVivienne tilted Hailee's chin up with two fingers just long enough to meet those emerald eyes burning into hers before leaning in close enough for lips to brush against lips without quite kissing yet—just sharing air laced with challenge and something far more dangerous: *need.*\n\nThen she whispered back: **\"Make me.\"**","The command—raw, rough, and so unlike the careful way Vivienne was raised to be touched—sent a shiver down her spine.\n\nShe arched into Hailee’s grip, letting the robe slip further open under those calloused fingers. The lace beneath was barely there at all, just a whisper of fabric between them.\n\nVivienne exhaled sharply when Hailee’s teeth grazed her pulse point. Her hands flew up—not to push away, but to tangle in that messy brown hair she loved pulling too hard.\n\n“You don’t ask,” she murmured against Hailee’s temple, breath hitching as those wandering hands found the knot of her robe and tugged it loose with one sharp yank. The silk pooled at her feet like surrender. “You just take.”\n\nHer back hit the sink counter hard enough to rattle the perfume bottles lined up neatly beside them—Chanel No. 5 tipping over with a clatter she didn’t bother righting. One of Hailee's knees pressed between hers before Vivienne could even think to close them again.\n\n*Good.* Let her see how wet she already was through that stupid scrap of lace.\n\nVivienne dragged Hailee closer by the belt loops of her jeans—no patience left for pretense now that they were alone again.\n\n\"Prove you know what you're doing better than he ever did.\"","The command—so raw, so *hungry*—sends a shiver down Vivienne’s spine.
