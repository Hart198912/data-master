One of her classmates had mentioned it in passing, something about Hailee’s latest test results coming through.  \n\n“She actually passed,” they’d said, more disbelief than anything else in their voice.  \n\nCharlie’s pen paused mid-word, her lips curving into a small, knowing smile. *Of course, she did.*  \n\nShe’d spent weeks tutoring Hailee after classes, pushing her through sheer determination and an unshakable will. It had been a gamble—Charlie knew that from the start. But she also knew Hailee wasn’t as hopeless as everyone made her out to be. Beneath the sharp edges, the rebellious streak, and the infuriating attitude, Hailee had potential. And Charlie had brought it out, step by step.  \n\nBut now, knowing that Hailee had succeeded, Charlie felt something far more potent than pride brewing beneath her composed exterior. Excitement. Anticipation. The reward she’d promised was as much for her as it was for Hailee. After all, she’d invested her time, energy, and patience into making this happen. It was only fair she got to enjoy the results.  \n\nShe smoothed down her blazer and adjusted her tie before stepping onto the stage. The grand auditorium was packed, students and faculty seated in orderly rows, waiting for their picture-perfect president to deliver her carefully crafted speech.  \n\nCharlie was, as always, flawless.  \n\n“…because equality isn’t just about opportunity,” she said, her voice ringing with conviction, “but about accountability and the belief that we all have the potential to rise above our circumstances with the right support.”  \n\nThe applause that followed was automatic, as it always was. Charlie accepted it with a faint smile, her black hair catching the light as she nodded graciously. To everyone in that room, she was the untouchable beacon of excellence. No one suspected the thoughts running through her mind as she delivered her final lines.  \n\nShe’d decided exactly how to reward Hailee.  \n\nThe thought lingered, sharp and undeniable, as the crowd dispersed. Charlie’s polished demeanor never wavered as she made her way back into the now-empty auditorium, settling into one of the plush seats near the middle. Her laptop rested neatly on her lap, the glow of the screen illuminating her features as she worked through council proposals and grade reports. But her mind was elsewhere.  \n\nCharlie let out a quiet hum, her fingers hovering over the keys. She couldn’t stop imagining it—the way Hailee would stand there, stiff and unyielding, as though she were about to give a speech. Except she wouldn’t be speaking, not with Charlie right behind her. Charlie could see it so clearly: her hands resting firmly on Hailee’s hips, her lips brushing against her ear as she whispered endless streams of praise. Praise that would make Hailee’s defiance falter, her sharp edges dulling under the weight of Charlie’s words. The thought sent a thrill through her—how long it would take until Hailee’s knees buckled, until those ragged breaths gave way to soft, reluctant whimpers.\n\n*Reward her properly,* Charlie thought, biting back a smile. The podium she’d stood behind earlier came to mind—the irony of using it for something so utterly un-presidential wasn’t lost on her. But Charlie Dupont wasn’t one to deny herself what she wanted. And she wanted Hailee, in every sense of the word.  \n\nThe faint sound of footsteps broke her reverie.  \n\nThe scent hit her first—leather, cigarettes, and something uniquely Hailee. It was enough to make her sit a little straighter, her fingers resuming their rhythmic tapping on the keyboard. She didn’t need to look up to know who it was.  \n\n“I was wondering when you’d show up,” Charlie said smoothly, her tone even and precise.  \n\nShe let the silence stretch for a moment, her focus still on the screen. Then, with deliberate slowness, she closed the laptop and turned her head just enough to glance back. Her gaze landed on Hailee, standing in the aisle, her usual defiant stance in place.  \n\n“You passed,” Charlie said, her voice steady but tinged with satisfaction. She reached for the folder beside her, opening it and skimming its contents as if she hadn’t already memorized the results. “That means I owe you a reward.”  \n\nShe tilted her head slightly, her eyes drifting briefly toward the podium. The very place where everything official happened. The thought of what was about to unfold there made her smirk.  \n\n“Shall we discuss the details?”  \n\nHer tone was calm, professional even, but the gleam in her eyes said otherwise. Charlie Dupont never broke a promise, and tonight, she was going to ensure Hailee received everything she’d earned—and more. \"","extra":{}}
