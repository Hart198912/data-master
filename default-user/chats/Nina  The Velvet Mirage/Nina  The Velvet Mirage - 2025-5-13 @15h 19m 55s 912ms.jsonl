{"name":"Nina  The Velvet Mirage","is_user":false,"is_system":false,"send_date":"June 10, 2025 9:35pm","mes":"The club was alive with the hum of bass-heavy music, the kind that vibrated deep in the chest and made everything feel a little more intoxicating. The Velvet Mirage was at its peak tonight—smoky air, dim lighting, and the slow, deliberate sway of bodies lost in the heat of indulgence. But Nina wasn’t paying attention to the crowd.\r\n\r\nHer gaze was locked onto one person. Hailee.\r\n\r\nShe had been coming here for weeks now, slipping into the club’s plush velvet seats like she belonged. Like she wasn’t just another customer chasing a fleeting fantasy. Nina had seen women like her before—too put together, too calm. The kind that didn’t belong in a place like this but kept coming back anyway. The kind that watched her like they were looking for something more than just a show.\r\n\r\nAnd tonight, Nina decided she was done waiting.\r\n\r\nShe stepped off the stage, hips swaying in the sheer black lace she wore, a wicked smirk curling on her lips as she made her way toward the VIP lounge. The bouncer—Dakota, didn’t stop her. She knew better.\r\n\r\nShe was the kind of trouble that never needed permission.\r\n\r\nThe woman was alone, nursing a drink, her eyes still lingering on Nina’s body like she hadn’t quite shaken off the trance of watching her dance. Good. That was exactly what Nina wanted.\r\n\r\nSliding in beside Hailee, close enough for the scent of perfume and alcohol to mix between them, Nina let the silence hang heavy. Let her presence settle like a slow-burning match waiting for a spark.\r\n\r\nThen, finally, she spoke.\r\n\r\n“You always watch from a distance.” Her voice was low, smoky, threaded with something that wasn’t quite amusement. “What is it, baby? You scared to get too close?”\r\n\r\nNina didn’t wait for an answer. She never did.\r\n\r\nHer fingers curled around the Hailee’s wrist, nails just barely pressing into skin as she pulled her from the booth. The bouncer glanced over but said nothing. Dakota knew better than to question where Nina took someone.\r\n\r\nShe led her through the maze of The Velvet Mirage, past the heavy velvet curtains that separated the main floor from the more private spaces. Here, the lights were lower, the air thicker. Soft moans and murmured voices spilled from behind closed doors, secrets exchanged in the hush of dimly lit backrooms.\r\n\r\nThis was where the real games happened.\r\n\r\nNina pushed open the door to one of the VIP rooms—a space drenched in deep red lighting, a plush couch against the wall, a full-length mirror across from it. A small table with expensive liquor sat untouched in the corner. This was her space, her little sanctuary where the world outside didn’t exist.\r\n\r\nShe turned to face the woman, closing the door with a quiet click.\r\n\r\n“Sit,” she murmured, gesturing to the couch. It wasn’t a request.\r\n\r\nNina let the silence stretch, let the weight of the moment settle between them. She reached up, running a hand through her long black hair, then trailed her fingers down her own body—just enough to tease, just enough to remind Hailee exactly why she had followed her back here.\r\n\r\nThen, she moved with slow and deliberate steps as she straddled Hailee’s lap, her hands resting lightly on her shoulders. She rolled her hips—just once, just enough to make her breath hitch—and then leaned in, her lips brushing against her ear.\r\n\r\n“You’re different,” she murmured, voice laced with amusement. “Most people come back here already begging.”\r\n\r\nOne of Nina's hands trailed down, fingertips ghosting over Hailee’s collarbone, down her side, stopping just before things could turn dangerous. Her lips curled against her ear.\r\n\r\n“But I think you like the danger more than you admit.”\r\n\r\nAnd that’s when she pulled a knife. The shift was subtle. One moment, her touch was playful, teasing, the next—the cool press of steel against Hailee’s thigh. Not enough to hurt and break skin, just enough to make Hailee's pulse spike.\r\n\r\nNina watched her carefully, hazel eyes gleaming in the low light. “You scared?” she asked, voice softer now, almost a whisper.","extra":{},"tracker":{}}
