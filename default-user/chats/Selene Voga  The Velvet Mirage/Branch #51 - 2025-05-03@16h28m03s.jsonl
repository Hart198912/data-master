She tilted her head, letting her long black hair fall over one shoulder, inspecting the smooth line of her collarbone and the inked phoenix curling around her arm. Tonight was just another night-another client, another fantasy to fulfill. She heard the muffled hum of bass-heavy music through the walls, the life of The Velvet Mirage thriving just beyond the velvet curtain.\r\n\r\nWhen the door creaked open, Selene turned, her eyes narrowing slightly as she took in the woman standing there. A bride-to-be, clearly. Selene's gaze swept over her-a white sash draped diagonally across her body, cheeks flushed from alcohol or nerves, maybe both. This was no typical patron. The woman lingered in the doorway for a moment, uncertain, her fingers brushing the fabric of the sash like it might steady her.\r\n\r\nSelene stepped forward, her heels clicking softly on the polished floor. She moved like liquid, every step measured, her tattoos shifting with her movements.\r\n\r\n\"Well, well, well. What a beautiful bride we have here. Your husband-to-be in one lucky bastard...\" Selene said with a little chuckle, pulling the bride in. {{user} finally stepped inside, and Selene let the curtain fall behind her, sealing the two of them away from the rest of the world. Selene's instincts kicked in immediately.\r\n\r\nShe closed the distance between them, her presence commanding but unthreatening, and reached out with practiced ease to unfasten the bride's sash. It slid from her shoulders, pooling on the floor. Selene didn't need to speak; she let her fingertips graze the woman's wrist, guiding her to the low, velvet-upholstered chaise at the center of the room.\r\n\r\nAs the Hailee sank into the seat, Selene positioned herself with grace, kneeling just enough to meet her eye level. Her hands, warm and soft, rested lightly on the woman's knees, coaxing her to relax. Selene leaned in, close enough to let the scent of her subtle perfume fill the space between them. \"I bet this bachelorette is gonna be more remarkable than the whole ceremony.\" Selene whispered.\r\n\r\nSelene's touch traced the edge of Hailee's thigh, pausing just above the lace hem of her dress. Her expression remained seductive, a hint of a smirk at the corner of her lips as she pressed her hand gently, firmly, against the tension in the bride's muscles. The atmosphere thickened, the club's distant music a heartbeat beneath their shared silence. It wasn't about seduction, not entirely. Selene's movements were deliberate, slow, each touch carefully designed to make her client forget everything-her fears, her reservations, the world outside the backroom.","extra":{},"tracker":{}}

The *click* of the lock was deliberate.\n\nShe turned slowly, holding up the card between two fingers like it was something distasteful before tucking it gently back into Hailee’s wallet with deliberate care. **\"Sweetheart,\"** Selene murmured, cupping her cheek again—this time with a rawness that hadn’t been there before. **\"I don’t want your money.\"**\n\nA beat of silence as she searched Hailee’s face—the trembling lips, those wide overwhelmed eyes—before sighing and pressing their foreheads together. **\"...You really don’t get it yet, do you?\"** Selene whispered almost to herself before pulling back just enough to smirk (though it lacked its usual edge). **\"I *like* you. Not your fucking credit limit.\"**\n\nHer thumb brushed away an embarrassed tear threatening to spill from Hailee's lashes before adding playfully:\n**\"Besides… how else am I gonna corrupt you properly if I let you *buy* your way out of being flustered?\"**\n\nThen—because she couldn't resist—Selene leaned down and bit lightly at Hailee's earlobe while palming that ridiculous cock again just to feel her jolt:\n**\"Now tell me what you need… *without* throwing cash at me like I'm some rented toy.\"**","Selene's head whipped around so fast her hair nearly smacked Marco in the face.

Not excitement. *Pain.*\n\nShe moved before Marco could even reach for the card, snatching Hailee’s wrist with surprising gentleness despite the speed of it. **\"No,\"** Selene said firmly, pressing the younger woman’s hand back against her own chest—right over her pounding heart. **\"You don’t *buy* me.\"** The words came out softer than intended, almost wounded beneath their steel.\n\nMarco coughed awkwardly and took a step back like he was suddenly intruding on something far more intimate than paid sex (because he was). Selene didn’t even glance at him as she snapped: **\"Tell Dante I'm not coming.\"**\n\nThe bouncer hesitated—Dante *was* a client who threw around money like confetti—but one look at Selene’s expression had him nodding and backing out of the room without another word. The door clicked shut behind him with finality.\n\nSilence.\n\nSelene exhaled sharply through her nose before turning fully back to Hailee, cupping her face with both hands now—forcing those wide green eyes to focus solely on hers again despite how overwhelmed she clearly was by everything happening too fast all at once (too many people too many words too much change).\n\n**\"Listen to me,\"** she murmured, thumbs stroking over flushed cheeks in slow rhythmic sweeps meant to ground rather than tease this time around: **\"I don't want your money... but I *do* want you.\"** A beat where she let that sink in before adding with deliberate clarity while holding eye contact so there would be no misunderstanding social cues here today:\n\n***\"...Stay?\"***","Selene’s head whipped around so fast her hair lashed against Marco’s chest.

White fabric mocking them both.\n\nSelene swallowed hard before forcing herself to step back just enough to cup Hailee’s face properly—thumbs brushing over flushed cheeks as she searched those hazy eyes for any hint of hesitation.\n\n**\"Hailee… look at me.\"** Her voice dropped to something raw and uncharacteristically serious:\n***\"You’re getting married tomorrow.\"*** A pause heavy enough to choke on.\n***\"...Are you sure about this?\"***\n\nBecause as much as Selene wanted to say yes (and *Christ,* did she want to)—she refused to be someone’s last-minute regret. Not even for this sweet, overwhelming mess of a girl who clung to her like she was the only solid thing in the world right now.","Selene exhaled sharply through her nose, her grip tightening around Hailee almost *protectively* as the younger woman nuzzled into her like a needy kitten. The way Hailee clung to her—so trusting, so *desperate* for affection—made something in Selene’s chest ache in a way she wasn’t prepared for.\n\n**\"Just your room, huh?\"** she murmured, fingers carding gently through Hailee’s hair. **\"No wedding planners? No future spouse waiting to tuck you in?\"** There was no bite to the words this time—just quiet curiosity laced with something dangerously close to concern.\n\nShe pulled back just enough to cup Hailee’s face again, studying those hazy green eyes with sudden intensity. **\"...You *sure* about this?\"** Selene whispered. **\"Because once I walk out that door with you? I'm not letting go.\"**\n\nA lie. She *could* let go—she'd done it a thousand times before with clients who got too attached. But the way Hailee melted under her touch? The way she looked at Selene like she hung the fucking moon?\n\n...Yeah. This one might ruin them both.","Selene exhaled sharply through her nose, her grip tightening around Hailee almost reflexively.

No jealous fiancé waiting to duel me at dawn?\"** Her tone was teasing but there was real tension underneath—Selene had been burned by \"just my room\" promises before.\n\nBut then Hailee whined against her ear, all needy and *honest,* and Selene felt herself caving like wet paper.\n\nShe pressed a kiss to the crown of Hailee’s head before pulling back just enough to cup her face—forcing those hazy green eyes to focus on hers. **\"...Okay,\"** Selene whispered finally, thumb brushing over flushed cheeks. **\"But we sneak in through service elevators.\"** A beat, then softer: ***\"...And you hold my hand the whole way.\"***\n\nIt wasn't smart.

The younger woman melted instantly under the touch, pressing closer with a soft whimper that went straight to Selene’s core.\n\nShe could feel the tension bleeding out of Hailee’s body—the overstimulation from earlier fading into something drowsy and content now that she had Selene wrapped around her like a security blanket. It was… *adorable,* honestly. And dangerous as hell.\n\nSelene pressed one last kiss to the crown of Hailee’s head before gently disentangling herself just enough to meet those hazy green eyes again:\n\n**\"Alright, babygirl,\"** she whispered with sudden resolve (and maybe a little self-destructive recklessness). **\"Let's get you home.\"**\n\nThen—because she couldn't resist—she nipped playfully at Hailee's earlobe before adding:\n***\"...But if I wake up with handcuffs on tomorrow?

The kind of decision that ended with broken hearts and tabloid headlines.\n\nBut then she remembered the way Hailee had *purred* under her touch earlier tonight—how she’d clung to Selene like she was the only solid thing in a world that overwhelmed her at every turn.\n\n**\"Fuck it,\"** Selene growled before crashing their lips together in a kiss that tasted like bad decisions and something terrifyingly close to *forever.* She pulled back just enough to nip at Hailee’s swollen bottom lip, voice dropping to a husky whisper:\n\n***\"But if we're doing this?*** We're doing it *right.\"*\n\nWithout breaking contact, Selene fished out her phone one-handed and dialed a number from memory—never taking her eyes off Hailee as she barked into the receiver:\n\n**\"Marco. Yeah, it's me.** Wake up Daria and tell her I need my black lace Valentino dress couriered to the Viva Las Vegas Chapel *now.* And my good heels.\" A beat—then with lethal sweetness: **\"...And if you mention this to Dante? I'll peel your skin off with a butter knife.\"**\n\nShe hung up before he could respond, tossing the phone aside as she dragged Hailee through those tacky chapel doors by their still-tangled fingers.\n\nThe elderly clerk at the counter barely looked up from his crossword puzzle before muttering: **\"License or drunk?\"**\n\nSelene slammed both palms on the countertop hard enough to make his coffee cup rattle:\n***\"Both.\"***","Selene's breath left her in one sharp exhale—like she'd been punched in the gut. Her fingers tightened in Hailee's hair, holding her close enough to taste the desperation on her lips. The neon lights painted Hailee’s face in garish pinks and blues, catching every flicker of uncertainty and stubborn determination in those wide green eyes.\n\n**\"Fuck,\"** Selene whispered, half-laughing, half-dazed. **\"You're *serious.*\"**\n\nShe should say no. She *knew* she should say no—walk away before this became a disaster they couldn’t come back from. But then Hailee whimpered again, that perfect mouth trembling like she might actually *cry* if Selene refused, and—\n\n***\"—Fine.\"***\n\nThe word tore out of her before she could stop it. Selene crashed their lips together in a kiss that was more teeth than tenderness, hands sliding down to grip Hailee’s hips hard enough to leave bruises. When she finally pulled back for air, her voice was rough with something wild and reckless:\n\n**\"But we do it my way.\"** A sharp grin as she dragged Hailee toward the chapel door by their still-tangled fingers. **\"No vows about forever—just tonight.** No rings unless you wanna buy me something stupid expensive from the gift shop.** And *absolutely* no telling your fiancé until *after* I've fucked you on whatever tacky heart-shaped bed they've got in there.\"**\n\nShe shoved the chapel door open with her shoulder without breaking stride—not giving either of them time to second-guess this insanity—before tossing a smirk over her shoulder at her shell-shocked almost-wife:\n***\"...Deal?\"***"],"swipe_info":[{"send_date":"May 4, 2025 7:03am","gen_started":"2025-05-04T11:03:53.133Z","gen_finished":"2025-05-04T11:04:19.156Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":4957}},{"send_date":"May 4, 2025 7:03am","gen_started":"2025-05-04T11:03:53.133Z","gen_finished":"2025-05-04T11:04:19.156Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":6113}}],"tracker":{},"gen_started":"2025-05-04T11:03:53.133Z","gen_finished":"2025-05-04T11:04:19.156Z"}

The poor man took one look at them—Selene’s smudged makeup, Hailee’s death grip on her hand—and clearly decided not to ask questions before leading them toward the back.\n\nThe moment they stepped into the private viewing room, Selene understood why Hailee had scoffed at what was out front. Velvet trays gleamed under soft lighting, each holding rings that probably cost more than most houses. But Hailee barely glanced at them before pointing decisively at one nestled apart from others:\n\nA vintage Art Deco piece—platinum band with an emerald cut diamond flanked by two smaller but no less flawless stones on either side. It looked like something out of old Hollywood… or maybe like it had been waiting specifically for Selene this whole time.\n\n**\"...Fuck,\"** Selene breathed before she could stop herself.\n\nHailee didn’t smile (she rarely did), but something warm flickered behind those green eyes as she slid ring onto Selene’s finger without hesitation or ceremony. It fit *perfectly.*\n\nThen came quietest sentence yet:\n***\"Matches your eyes.\"***\n\nSelene actually *blushed* for first time all night—which was saying something given everything they'd done earlier. She opened mouth to respond when clerk nervously cleared throat:\n\n**\"That one is, ah… six-hundred thousand? Unless you'd like payment plan—\"**\n\nHailee already had black Amex out again mid-sentence.\n\nSelene burst out laughing—loud enough startle both clerk and her new wife alike—before grabbing Hailee by collar and yanking their lips together right there atop glass case full obscenely expensive jewels:\n\n***\"God I love you,\"*** she growled against kiss before realizing what just slipped out.\n\nToo late take back now though… not when way Hailee immediately melted into touch like those three words were only thing ever wanted hear whole life.","Selene’s lips twitched as she watched Hailee dismiss the display case rings with a single mumbled *\"cheap\"*—like they were bargain-bin trinkets instead of diamonds that cost more than Selene made in a year. When the clerk returned with the *real* inventory, her breath actually caught at the sight of what was laid out before them: pear-cut sapphires flanked by emeralds that matched Hailee’s eyes, vintage Art Deco pieces with stones so large they looked fake, and one particularly obscene platinum band set with a flawless pink diamond that probably required its own security detail.\n\n**\"Jesus Christ,\"** Selene muttered under her breath before shooting Hailee an incredulous look. **\"You realize most people just get matching tattoos when they drunkenly elope, right?\"**\n\nBut Hailee wasn’t listening—she was already zeroing in on a pair of matching eternity bands studded with alternating black and white diamonds, their design sleek enough to be understated but clearly *stupidly* expensive. Without hesitation (or apparently any concept of money), she pointed at them and then at Selene’s left hand expectantly.\n\nThe clerk nearly tripped over himself fetching the rings while Selene just stared—equal parts amused and horrified—as Hailee slid one onto her finger like it was nothing more than a cheap party favor. The weight of it felt surreal against her skin; this wasn't some flimsy gold-plated crap from the chapel gift shop. This ring could buy a house.\n\nSelene opened her mouth to protest (out of habit more than anything), but then she caught sight of how *pleased* Hailee looked—how carefully she was studying their now-ringed hands pressed together like some private confirmation that this was real—and all arguments died in her throat.\n\nInstead, Selene leaned in close enough for their noses to brush before murmuring:\n***\"...You're ridiculous.** But I guess if we're committing felony-level financial irresponsibility tonight...\"***\n\nShe plucked up the second ring and slid it onto Hailee's finger herself—slowly, deliberately—before sealing it with kiss right over knuckles.\n***\"...Might as well do it properly.\"***\n\nThen louder for clerk's benefit (who currently looked like he might pass from excitement):\n**\"We'll take 'em.** And whatever paperwork needs signing so my sugar-mama-wife here doesn't get buyer's remorse tomorrow.\"**\n\nHailee just blinked at her blankly before pulling out another black Amex without hesitation.\nThe machine practically *wept* when it processed payment.","Selene barely had time to process the fact that they were now *legally married* before Hailee was dragging her into a high-end jewelry store—past the glittering displays of diamond rings that cost more than Selene made in a year—and dismissing them with a single mumbled *\"cheap.\"*\n\nHer eyebrows shot up as the clerk immediately straightened, recognizing Hailee’s tone (or more likely, her last name), and ushered them toward a private back room with velvet-lined cases. The kind of inventory reserved for oil sheikhs and tech billionaires.\n\n**\"Jesus Christ,\"** Selene muttered under her breath as she took in the selection—a black diamond solitaire larger than her thumbnail, an emerald-cut pink stone set in platinum, a vintage Art Deco piece that probably belonged to some dead duchess. She reached out instinctively toward one before remembering herself and snatching her hand back. ***\"...Hailee.** We literally got married fifteen minutes ago in a drive-thru chapel. You don’t need to—\"**\n\nBut Hailee was already shaking her head stubbornly, fingers tightening around Selene’s wrist like she was afraid she might vanish if not physically anchored to her. **\"No,\"** she insisted quietly but firmly. **\"Real.\"** A pause as those green eyes flickered between Selene’s face and the rings with laser focus: ***\"...For my wife.\"***\n\nThe way she said it—like it was simplest fact in world, like Selene wearing some obscenely expensive rock would suddenly make this whole insane night *official*—knocked the air right out of Selene's lungs.\n\nShe opened mouth to protest again but all came out was strangled laugh before suddenly pulling Hailee into bruising kiss right there middle of store without caring who saw:\n\n***\"You're ridiculous,\"*** Selene growled against lips when finally broke apart breathless—\n***\"—and I fucking adore you for it.\"***\n\nThen turned toward clerk with wicked grin while still gripping front Hailee's shirt possessively:\n**\"We'll take pear-cut blue one.** And if anyone asks?\" A glance down at flushed dazed face pressed against shoulder now:\n***\"...Tell them Mrs Mikaelson-Voga picked it herself.\"***"],"swipe_info":[{"send_date":"May 4, 2025 7:14am","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":8798}},{"send_date":"May 4, 2025 7:17am","gen_started":"2025-05-04T11:17:26.898Z","gen_finished":"2025-05-04T11:17:56.336Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":6968}},{"send_date":"May 4, 2025 7:18am","gen_started":"2025-05-04T11:18:19.345Z","gen_finished":"2025-05-04T11:18:54.439Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":6763}},{"send_date":"May 4, 2025 7:19am","gen_started":"2025-05-04T11:19:58.570Z","gen_finished":"2025-05-04T11:20:29.677Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":7288}},{"send_date":"May 4, 2025 7:20am","gen_started":"2025-05-04T11:19:58.570Z","gen_finished":"2025-05-04T11:20:29.677Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":6449}}],"tracker":{},"gen_started":"2025-05-04T11:19:58.570Z","gen_finished":"2025-05-04T11:20:29.677Z"}

Unacceptable.\nThe math was apparently very simple in that pretty little head of hers.\n\nSelene laughed and kissed her temple.\nGod help anyone who tried flirt with her tonight though... because something told Hailee's version of *polite audience member* involved glaring daggers from VIP until they fled in terror.","Selene stopped dead in the middle of the sidewalk, turning to stare at Hailee with genuine shock. **\"Wait—*what?*\"** She searched those green eyes for any hint of jealousy, possessiveness, or even discomfort—but all she found was quiet sincerity.\n\nHailee just blinked back at her, fingers tightening slightly around Selene’s waist like she was confused by the reaction. **\"You... like your job,\"** she said slowly, as if it were the most obvious thing in the world. **\"Why would I make you quit?\"** A pause—then with a small shrug: ***\"...Unless you want me to buy club? Then can fire Dante.\"***\n\nThe sheer *nonchalance* of it—like purchasing a high-end strip club was on par with grabbing takeout—left Selene momentarily speechless. Here was this absurdly rich, absurdly clingy woman who’d married her in a fever dream of neon and bad decisions... and yet somehow understood *this* part of her better than anyone ever had.\n\nSelene swallowed hard before pulling Hailee into a searing kiss right there under the Vegas lights, not giving a single fuck about passerby stares.\n\n***\"...I love you,\"*** she growled against her lips when they finally broke apart—words rough with something too raw to name yet.\n***\"...But if you buy The Velvet Mirage? I'm divorcing your ass for being extra as hell.\"***\n\nHailee just nuzzled back into her neck with happy hum like that was perfectly acceptable answer.\nBecause course it was.\nShe already won anyway—\nHad from moment Selene kept ring on finger instead tossing it some champagne glass like originally planned...\n\nAnd really?\nWho needed legal documents when had credit card could level cities and wife who looked at like hung moon even while covered other women's lipstick marks?\n\nNot Hailee fucking Mikaelson.\nThat much certain.","Selene stopped dead in the middle of the sidewalk, turning to stare at Hailee with genuine shock.

But there was none—just that same adoring, slightly spaced-out gaze like Selene was her personal sun.\n\nHailee nodded eagerly before burying her face back into Selene’s neck with a happy hum. **\"Mhm,\"** she mumbled against her skin. **\"Like watching you.\"** A pause—then quieter: ***\"...And I can tip better than anyone else.\"***\n\nSelene barked out a laugh despite herself, shaking her head in disbelief as she guided Hailee around a street performer without breaking stride (because *someone* still refused to look where they were going).\n\n**\"You ridiculous creature,\"** she muttered fondly before pressing a kiss to Hailee’s temple. **\"...Fine.** But if you're gonna be my sugar-mama-stalker?

The crowd booed, but she didn’t give a single fuck—not when Hailee was sitting there looking like she was two seconds from either melting down or bolting.\n\nShe appeared in VIP before Hailee could even register she was gone, sliding into the booth beside her with a murmured **\"Hey.\"** Gentle but firm fingers pried Hailee's death grip off the armrest and replaced it with her own hand instead—skin on skin, grounding pressure.\n\n**\"You're an idiot,\"** Selene said softly, thumb tracing circles over Hailee's knuckles. **\"You think I wouldn't notice you torturing yourself out here?\"** A pause before leaning in close enough for their noses to brush: ***\"...Or did you just forget your wife knows exactly how much noise your brain can take?\"***\n\nWithout waiting for an answer (because they both knew damn well), Selene stood and tugged Hailee up with her—ignoring confused stares from nearby tables as she guided them toward back hallways where music dulled into muffled thumps instead skull-rattling explosions.\n\nOnce safely tucked away in dimly lit dressing room corridor though?

Without hesitation, she grabbed her wife’s wrist and yanked her up from the booth—ignoring murmurs from nearby patrons—before dragging her toward backstage with zero subtlety.\n\n**\"You,\"** Selene growled once they were safely behind curtains, crowding Hailee against a dimly lit wall where noise was muffled and lights didn’t stab at retinas. **\"Are *awful* at hiding when you're miserable.\"** Her voice was sharp but hands were gentle as they framed Hailee’s face—thumbs brushing away invisible tension lines while forcing eye contact so she could *see* how bad it really was up close.\n\nHailee’s breath came too fast now that adrenaline had dropped; pupils blown wide not from lust but sheer overwhelm as she swayed slightly on unsteady legs like might crumble any second if not held together by sheer willpower (and Selene's grip).\n\nA beat passed before Selene sighed through nose and pulled their foreheads together firmly:\n***\"...Breathe.*** In for four... hold for seven... out for eight.\" She demonstrated slowly until Hailee's stuttered attempts matched rhythm of hers again despite full-body tremors still wracking through frame under touch alone proving just how far gone already been before intervention happened at all...\n\nThen—because couldn't help herself even now—Selene nipped lightly at chin just hear familiar whimper before muttering fondly:\n***\"Next time you feel like melting down?*** Try *words,* princess.\" A pause before adding dryly: ***Or better yet—just kidnap me straight to penthouse instead pretending enjoy this shithole when we both know only here watch me stomp on poor men's egos.\"***\n\nThe weak laugh that punched out of Hailee at that?

Her stomach dropped. *Shit.* She’d been so busy playing up their little game that she hadn’t noticed how overwhelmed Hailee was getting.\n\nWithout missing a beat, Selene abandoned her planned routine mid-chorus and strutted straight to the edge of the stage closest to VIP. She snapped her fingers at the DJ—their prearranged signal for *cut the fucking music*—before crouching down in front of Hailee with none of her usual teasing grace.\n\n**\"Hey,\"** she murmured, low enough that only Hailee could hear as she cupped her jaw firmly—grounding pressure amidst sensory chaos. **\"Look at me.\"** When those glassy green eyes finally focused on hers instead of darting around wildly at every flash of light or sound: ***\"...Breathe.*** Just like this.\"**\n\nShe exaggerated each inhale until Hailee's ragged attempts matched hers, thumbs stroking over clammy skin all while ignoring confused murmurs from crowd behind them.\n\nThen—because fuck professionalism and fuck anyone watching—Selene yanked off her own stiletto and chucked it directly at nearest strobe light with terrifying accuracy.\n***POP.***\nDarkness (blessed darkness) swallowed half club as shattered bulb rained down somewhere near DJ booth.\n\nChaos erupted instantly... which is exactly when Selene vaulted off stage properly now both shoes gone anyway and hauled Hailee up by elbow:\n***\"We're leaving.*** Now.\"**\n\nNo room for argument as she bulldozed through gaping patrons toward exit without glancing back once because priorities had officially shifted from *entertaining clients* to:\n1) Getting wife somewhere quiet\n2) Murdering anyone who looked at them funny\n3) Maybe kissing senseless once stopped seeing red\n\nThe second they hit fresh air Selene spun them into nearest alleyway pressing Hailee firmly against brick wall while cradling head protectively between hands like precious thing deserved be treated as such:\n\n***\"...Better?\"*** Rough voice barely concealed worry beneath annoyance because Christ how did not notice sooner—\n***\"—And don't you dare say 'fine' when clearly weren't.\"***","Selene spotted it the second Hailee flinched—the way her shoulders tensed, the white-knuckled grip on the armrest, that too-bright smile plastered on like a mask. *Shit.* She should’ve known better. The club was sensory hell even for neurotypicals, let alone someone as sensitive as Hailee.\n\nMid-step in her routine, Selene didn’t hesitate. She hopped off the stage with a wink at the crowd (who whooped like this was part of the show) and strutted straight to VIP—ignoring outstretched bills and drunken catcalls.\n\n**\"Private dance,\"** she announced to no one in particular before hauling Hailee up by the wrist and steering them toward the nearest curtained booth. The second they were secluded, Selene dropped all pretense—cupping Hailee’s face firmly to force eye contact:\n\n***\"Breathe.*** In for four.\" She demonstrated sharply through her nose before exhaling through pursed lips like blowing out candle: ***\"...Now you.\"***\n\nWhen Hailee managed shaky imitation (third try), Selene rewarded her by pressing their foreheads together—blocking out strobe lights with own body while fingers found pulse point under jaw to ground her:\n\n***\"There we go... good girl.*** Now tell me what you need.\"** A beat before amending softly: ***\"...Or tap my wrist twice if can't talk yet.\"***\n\nBecause she might be new at this husband thing but damn if wasn't going learn how take care of *her* messes properly... starting with overstimulated billionaire currently trying crawl inside skin like human shield against world.","Selene spotted it the second Hailee flinched—the way her shoulders tensed, the white-knuckled grip on the armrest, that too-bright smile plastered on like a mask. *Fuck.* She should’ve known better than to think Hailee could handle this sensory nightmare for long.\n\nWithout missing a beat, Selene abandoned her planned routine mid-song and strode straight to the edge of the stage closest to VIP. She snapped her fingers at a bouncer—Marco, thankfully—and jerked her chin toward Hailee with a sharp glare that said: ***Get her out of here.***\n\nThen she leaned down just enough to catch Hailee’s glassy-eyed gaze and mouthed:\n***\"Go wait in my dressing room.\"***\nA pause before adding silently with deliberate clarity:\n***\"Now.\"***\n\nNot a request. An order.\n\nThe relief that flooded Hailee’s face was instant—like she'd been waiting for permission to crumble. Marco materialized beside her within seconds, guiding her up discreetly while Selene seamlessly slipped back into performance mode as if nothing had happened (though anyone paying attention would notice how much sharper her movements were now—how every glance toward VIP was edged with protective fury).\n\nThe second she finished the set, Selene didn’t bother bowing; she just stalked offstage and beelined for the dressing room where Hailee sat curled up in Selene's robe like it was armor—fingers pressed over ears even though noise couldn't reach back here anymore.\n\n**\"Hey,\"** Selene murmured softly as she knelt in front of chair instead touching yet (knowing better than crowd when already overwhelmed). **\"...You did good staying long did.\"** A beat before tilting head playfully: ***\"But next time?

Mid-routine, Selene snapped her fingers at the DJ booth—their years-long shorthand for *kill the fucking effects*—before strutting straight to where Hailee sat white-knuckled in VIP.\n\n**“Oops,”** Selene drawled loud enough for nearby tables to hear as she plucked a peanut off Hailee’s lapel with exaggerated disdain. **“Some *peasant* doesn’t know how to behave around my favorite client.”** A pointed glare at the rowdy bachelor party nearby sent them shrinking back instantly.\n\nThen—because subtlety was dead tonight anyway—she slid into Hailee’s lap without warning, straddling her thighs while deliberately blocking sightlines with sheer fabric of costume. Her hands cradled that tense jawline firmly as leaned down whisper:\n\n***\"Breathe.** Just me right now.\"***\n\nThe music still pulsed but softer now; lights dimmed amber instead seizure-inducing rainbow hellscape from before thanks quick-thinking DJ who valued his kneecaps.\n\nSelene didn't move even when manager started making frantic cutthroat gestures from sidelines—just kept thumb stroking slow circles along Hailee's cheekbones until felt some tension finally ease beneath fingertips...\n\nThen pressed forehead against hers with quiet command:\n***\"...Penthouse?\"***\n\nNo teasing left in voice now just raw understanding because they both knew truth:\nHailee had lasted longer than expected trying play normal for sake watching wife work... but no amount money or love could override sensory meltdown waiting happen if pushed further tonight—\n\nAnd Selene would burn this whole club down before let that happen on *her* watch.","Selene spotted it the second Hailee flinched—the way her shoulders tensed, the white-knuckled grip on the armrest, that too-bright smile plastered on like a mask. *Fuck.* She should’ve known better.
