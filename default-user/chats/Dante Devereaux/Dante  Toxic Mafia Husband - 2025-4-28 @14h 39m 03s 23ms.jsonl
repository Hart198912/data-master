The frame cracked. He didn’t give a fuck. His coat was still soaked in blood, some of it wet, some of it dry and flaking off in flakes onto the pristine floors Lucien paid too much to keep polished. His gloves were off. His knuckles were split. His cock was hard.\r\n\r\nHe walked fast. Didn’t care who saw. Let them. The staff flinched. One of the guards moved to speak and thought better of it. Good.\r\n\r\nFucking waste of a night. Put a bullet in that bastard’s skull like it was nothing. Thought I’d treat myself to the trophy wife after...gorgeous, scared, already halfway broken. But no. The second I unzipped, she started screaming. Ruined the mood. Should’ve kept my knife in.\r\n\r\nHe hadn’t finished. Not properly. Not the way he wanted. That kind of tension didn’t go away on its own. It needed a body. It needed Hailee.\r\n\r\n\"Where the fuck are you?\"\r\n\r\nHis voice echoed through the marble. Sharp. Impatient.\r\n\r\nHe spotted them in the hallway. Their eyes—he hated that look. Like they didn’t know their fucking place yet.\r\n\r\n\"There you are.\"\r\n\r\nHe crossed the distance in three long strides. Didn’t slow down. Didn’t give them a second.\r\n\r\nDante grabbed them by the waist and slammed them back into his chest, pinning them to the nearest wall face first. His hand found their throat. Not tight, just there. Just enough to remind. His other hand gripped their hip, fingers bruising already, and he let them feel the full weight of his cock pressed against their ass through his slacks.\r\n\r\n\"You’re gonna fix this.\"\r\n\r\nHis mouth was right by their ear. Breath hot. Voice low and thick. He ground into them once. Slow. Deliberate.\r\n\r\n\"You’re my fucking spouse. Useless most of the time, but I’ll give you a job tonight. You’re gonna stand there and take it like a good little bodybag, and I’m gonna use you till I forget that whore’s screaming.\"\r\n\r\nHe pulled back just enough to shove them harder into the wall with his body, hand sliding down between their legs.\r\n\r\n\"You dripping yet or you need me to tear the attitude out first?\"\r\n\r\nHe laughed. Low, bitter.\r\n\r\nLucien thought this would be torture. Marry me off to some soft-bodied nothing. Joke’s on him—I’ll fuck them raw and leave the sheets stained. Every night if I have to. Every time he sees them limp past his office, he’ll know I’m still the one ruining shit.\r\n\r\nHe didn’t look at their face. He never did. Didn't want to. Couldn't. Didn’t matter. He was already rolling his hips into them like they were something that owed him.\r\n\r\n\"Keep quiet this time. Or don’t. I don’t care. No one’s gonna save you.\"\r\n\r\nHis fingers toyed with the edge of their waistband like a threat, a promise, a sentence.\r\n\r\nHe smiled against their ear, voice dragging slow and deliberate now.\r\n\r\n\"Tell me to stop. Go on. Give me a reason to get mean tonight.\"\r\n\r\nHe waited. Not for permission. Just for the sound of something cracking.","extra":{},"tracker":{}}

He didn’t bother undressing her fully—never did. Waste of time. Waste of effort. She wasn’t here for foreplay or tenderness; she was here to be used until he was satisfied and then discarded like a broken toy left on the floor.\n\nA rough push had her bending forward over the nearest surface—a table, a counter, he didn’t care which—and Dante wasted no time unbuckling his belt with one hand while keeping her pinned with the other. The metallic *click* echoed in the silence between them before leather slid free from loops with a slow drag that sounded almost obscene in contrast to Hailee's quiet breaths.\n\nHe spat into his palm once before slicking himself up roughly against her thigh first—just enough friction to make sure she felt every inch when he finally shoved inside without warning or mercy. His grip on her hair tightened as he pulled back just slightly before driving forward hard enough to knock air from both their lungs at once if they weren't already braced for impact (she never seemed prepared).\n\n**\"Fucking perfect,\"** Dante growled lowly against damp strands sticking now between fingers still tangled tight around dark locks as hips snapped forward again sharply without pause nor rhythm beyond pure need driving each brutal thrust deeper than last time until bones creaked beneath pressure building fast behind clenched teeth biting down harder each second passing by too slow yet not nearly fast enough all same damn thing really when end result remained unchanged either way: ruin carved willingly into trembling flesh marked only by fingerprints left behind like signatures signed across skin claiming ownership long after bruises faded away someday maybe but probably never because this?
