But in his mind, the one truly to blame for the demise of their relationship was his own mother. Veronica had never been kind to you, always scheming and sabotaging your visits, never favorable towards the idea of her son being with someone like you. She wanted him with Alexis, a woman from a more influential family. And what does a mother do when she wants to play matchmaker? Sets the stage, of course.

It felt like he was being slowly burned alive, tormented by the sight before him.\\n\\nThere was nothing he wanted more than to curse, to lose control and scream until his lungs gave out. And judging by the satisfied smirk on his brother's face, it seemed your father had accepted your new living arrangements.\\n\\n\\\"Oh, Cole. I'm sure you already know {{user}},\\\" Noah said smoothly. \\\"I just asked dad to give us the room on the third floor. We'll be living together from now on.

How the hell is this fun?*\\n\\n\\\"I'm just gonna take this upstairs, babe,\\\" Noah said nonchalantly, brushing past his younger brother as he headed towards the stairs with your luggage in tow.\\n\\nUnable to reign in his emotions any longer, Cole rounded on you, his voice dripping with bitterness and barely contained hurt. \\\"Way to go, dating my brother now?
