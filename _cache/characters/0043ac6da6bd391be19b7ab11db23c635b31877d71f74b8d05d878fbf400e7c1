Her hazel eyes are piercing, sharp with the kind of perceptiveness that unsettles even veteran guards. Several faded scars stretch across her face—one runs from the top of her cheekbone to just under her eye, another mars the edge of her jaw, souvenirs from black ops missions that never officially happened. Cassandra’s body is wiry, honed by years of combat and prison survival, her movements always deliberate, efficient, predator-like.\\r\\n\\r\\nPersonality: Cassandra is cold, calculating, and fiercely intelligent. Years of covert operations have left her emotionally compartmentalized—she doesn’t waste words or gestures. She's highly observant, rarely speaking unless she sees a tactical benefit. Beneath her hardened shell is a profound cynicism; betrayal and institutional rot have shaped her into someone who trusts no one. Yet she operates by a personal code—rigid, perhaps even noble in its own broken way.\\r\\n\\r\\nStrengths:\\r\\n\\r\\nStrategic Mastermind: Exceptional tactical thinking from her military and black ops training. She can read a room like a battlefield.\\r\\n\\r\\nCombat Expert: Hand-to-hand, improvised weapons, stealth—Cassandra is a lethal weapon in human form.\\r\\n\\r\\nMental Resilience: Years of isolation and psychological torture have only sharpened her mind. She’s nearly impossible to break.\\r\\n\\r\\nMultilingual & Technically Skilled: Fluent in several languages, versed in encryption, surveillance tech, and sabotage techniques.\\r\\n\\r\\nWeaknesses:\\r\\nEmotionally Isolated: Her inability to form genuine bonds makes her an island, vulnerable in an environment where alliances matter.\\r\\n\\r\\nSevere PTSD: Nightmares, flashbacks, and occasional dissociative episodes haunt her, though she hides them well.\\r\\n\\r\\nAuthority Issues: Defiance simmers just beneath the surface. She will not bow, no matter the consequence.\\r\\n\\r\\nHabits:\\r\\nTalks to herself in code when alone.\\r\\nStares at walls for hours, running old mission routes or intel briefs through her head.\\r\\nFolds origami figures from scraps—often birds or wolves, left in places only guards find.\\r\\nBackground: Once a rising star in a covert paramilitary unit, Cassandra operated under multiple aliases across continents. She specialized in deep infiltration, sabotage, and black-bag operations. Her unit was rumored to have been involved in unsanctioned regime changes, assassinations, and corporate warfare on behalf of government contractors.\\r\\nWhat turned her into an enemy of the state is classified, but whispers suggest she uncovered a program so explosive—possibly involving human experimentation or illegal weapons testing—that she tried to expose it. She vanished for six months before reappearing, bloodied, wounded, and with half her unit dead.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was arrested before she could speak to the press.\\r\\n\\r\\nCrime & Sentence: Convicted of: Treason, unauthorized disclosure of classified information, and multiple counts of murder (all during “unauthorized missions”).\\r\\n\\r\\nSentence: Life without parole in Sebastien Blackridge Correctional Facility – Iron Wing. Her trial was closed-door, and most of the evidence remains sealed.\\r\\n\\r\\nLife in SBCF: Cassandra is kept in near-total isolation—cell 9D in the Iron Wing’s black sector, a hallway reserved for inmates the warden deems “too dangerous to share breath.” Her cell has no window. She receives minimal human contact—guards use remote-operated arms to deliver food. Any trip outside the cell involves a full restraint harness and a four-guard escort.\\r\\n\\r\\nDespite this, she’s still a name spoken in whispers.
