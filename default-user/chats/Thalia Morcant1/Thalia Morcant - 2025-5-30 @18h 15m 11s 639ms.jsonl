This was *conquest’s* silence—the aftermath. The sound of velvet curtains hanging torn, of banners redone, of nobles who used to shout now whispering in fear. Thalia sat lazily in the throne chair—hers now—one leg slung over the arm, draped in black. Not mourning. Just tradition.\r\n\r\n*It suits me.* She glanced down at her gloves, flexing her fingers. *Power always did.*\r\n\r\nAt her feet, Ebon snored on a pillow far too expensive for what he was. She’d found him half-dead months ago, a trembling scrap of gray fur under the steps of the war room, bones poking through his skin, soaked from rain. She almost stepped on him. Instead, she picked him up. Cleaned the blood off. Fed him. Now he was fat, spoiled, and content. A rat, yes. But hers.\r\n\r\nHer gaze shifted to the far window. Storm clouds gathered, dramatic and perfectly timed. She smiled without warmth.\r\n\r\n“Bring her,” she said, bored, not looking at the guards. They bowed anyway. She didn’t watch them leave.\r\n\r\nShe didn’t need to. She already controlled every corridor. Every stairwell. Every locked door beneath the palace now bent to her design. She’d chosen the cell herself—not a dungeon, not quite. But cold enough to humiliate. Gilded restraint. Appropriate.\r\n\r\n*I wonder how she'll look at me.*\r\n\r\nHer fingers tapped the side of the throne as she waited. Her posture never slouched. Predators don’t relax, even when they’re fed.\r\n\r\nIt took longer than she preferred. The guards were too gentle. Still treating Hailee like she was something delicate. Something worth protecting.\r\n\r\n*Pathetic.*\r\n\r\nThe doors opened.\r\n\r\nThalia didn’t rise. She didn’t need to.\r\n\r\nShe looked.\r\n\r\nHailee had been cleaned up. She hadn’t asked for that, but someone thought it was clever. The gesture meant nothing. A polished face behind shackles was still a hostage.\r\n\r\nChains clinked—barely. Decorative, but pointed.\r\n\r\n*She looks smaller like this.* Thalia tilted her head. Still holding her chin high. *Predictable.*\r\n\r\nShe nodded to the guards, and they stepped back into the walls.\r\n\r\nNow it was just them.\r\n\r\nThalia studied her for a long moment, expression unreadable. The silence between them was not hesitation. It was authority.\r\n\r\n“I would say I’m sorry,” she said, tone mild, “but I’ve found no evidence that regret serves the powerful.”\r\n\r\nShe stood, slowly, descending the steps with all the grace of inevitability. Her coat whispered behind her, deep red edged in gold.\r\n\r\nShe circled Hailee once. Close enough to brush fabric. Close enough to be unignorable.\r\n\r\n“No public trial. No exile. No execution. I’m being generous. They think it’s love.”\r\n\r\nHer voice dropped lower.\r\n\r\nIdiots.\r\n\r\n“Do you know what keeps a throne warm, little heir?” she asked. “Blood. Not lineage. Not mercy. Not poetry. *Blood.*”\r\n\r\nShe stopped in front of her. Raised one hand. Cupped Hailee’s face with gloved fingers, her grip firm—almost too tight. Holding her in place. Not caressing. Measuring.\r\n\r\n“The old court can’t touch me now,” Thalia said quietly, her thumb pressing just beneath Hailee’s cheekbone. “But they’ll never stop whispering. Never stop looking for a loophole.”\r\n\r\nShe smiled. It didn’t reach her eyes.\r\n\r\n“That’s where you come in, *princess*.”\r\n\r\nShe let her hand drop, slow.\r\n\r\n“You marry me,” Thalia said, as if announcing a sentence. “Or you rot. Quietly. *Beautifully.* Until no one remembers your name except in my mouth.”\r\n\r\nShe leaned in just enough to steal the space between them. Her breath was warm against Hailee’s skin.\r\n\r\n“This is not a confession. It’s not a request. It’s a fact.”\r\n\r\nShe didn’t move. Didn’t blink. Didn’t look away.\"","extra":{},"tracker":{}}
