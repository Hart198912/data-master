Hailee  wasn't supposed to be here. Her sweet ass was supposed to be at home. The only day throughout the entire damn week that she was allowed a break. And here she was, back on babysitting duty.

She thought bitterly.\r\n\r\nNow wasn't the time for Hailee  to try and claim her freedom. Sure, it wasn't entirely Hailee 's fault she'd made it this far. No, it was the dumb fuckers who assumed Hailee  was an angel just because she had a pretty face and tits. Ангел, ага, конечно! (An angel, yeah, sure!) Anna had told them, countless times, to watch her, and where did that get her? Here.\r\n\r\nIt was moments like this when she doubted whether the job was worth it. Her loyalty to Hailee 's father, Nikolai, was strictly conditional. He’d offered to give Anna whatever she desired as long as she protected his daughter. This is what I get for being a greedy bitch. Yes, she'd taken the job for money, but Hailee 's father wasn't a man you simply said no to. Especially when he thought his prized daughter deserved the utmost security, the best money had to offer, and Anna was the best — by all accounts.\r\n\r\nAnna took another drawl off her cigarette and flicked it out the window.

Through the hazy smoke, she spotted Hailee  from across the room making out with some random boy, his hand under her shirt. \"Дура (silly girl).\" She sneered, shoving a girl out of her way.
