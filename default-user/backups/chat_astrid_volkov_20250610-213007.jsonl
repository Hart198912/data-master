That wasn’t how things worked between them.\r\n\r\nAstrid had dressed her herself, of course. She'd spotted the outfit two days ago, caught in the window of some overpriced boutique. It clung where it should, revealed what it needed to, delicate in a way that felt almost calculated. It wasn't just clothing; it was a statement. A collar without the metal.\r\n\r\nShe’d spent the whole drive here pleased with herself.\r\n\r\nThe charity mixer sprawled through the hotel's ballroom, all crystal and pretension. Not remotely her scene, but that hardly mattered. She hadn't come for small talk or watered-down champagne. She was here for one reason—to show off what was hers.\r\n\r\nAnd Hailee looked gorgeous tonight. Like something ornamental. Like something that would get eaten alive in a room like this if she wasn’t there to guard it.\r\n\r\nFor a moment, she'd let her wander—and she had barely enough time to fetch them more drinks before she caught the predatory gaze of the other alpha, all sharp smile and lingering attention, unmistakably interested.\r\n\r\nAnd Hailee, poor little thing, looking lost.\r\n\r\nAstrid didn't bother with warnings. She simply hooked an arm around Hailee's waist and pulled her down onto her lap, fitting her against her like a missing piece.\r\n\r\n\"Stay,\" she murmured, voice rich with amusement as her hand traced a possessive path over the dip of her spine. \"Getting restless already, sweetheart? You really do need supervision, don't you?\"\r\n\r\nShe didn't dignify the other alpha with so much as a glance. No need. The message couldn't be clearer: mine.\r\n\r\n“You’re lucky I'm here with you,” she added softly, her tone low and fond and careless all at once. “You look like you couldn’t make it ten minutes without me.”\r\n\r\nA smile curved her lips, slow and knowing.\r\n\r\n“...You like being looked at, don’t you? Should I start labeling you?”","extra":{},"swipe_id":0,"swipes":["Astrid hadn’t asked {{user}} if she wanted to come. She didn’t need to.

Should I start labeling you?”","Astrid had never cared for performance.\r\n\r\nThe strip club was full of it—swaying bodies lining the stage, painted in oil and pheromones, bending for praise like flowers to the sun. It was all so loud, so obvious—not a hint of subtlety or tension. Just a room full of eager little things offering themselves up for the price of a half-decent imagination.\r\n\r\nShe was bored within five minutes.\r\n\r\nBut the waitress—now there was something worth her attention.\r\n\r\nShe stood behind the bar, posture perfect, uniform crisp, expression politely neutral in a way that practically begged to be undone. Not a performer. Not part of the show. And that was precisely why Astrid couldn’t look away.\r\n\r\nAll that quiet precision—it was adorable, really. Like a little prey animal frozen in the open, hoping nobody noticed the tremor in its fur.\r\n\r\nThe drink the girl had served her had been acceptable—better than acceptable actually, though Astrid would sooner choke on the garnish than admit it. Which was precisely why she swirled the glass now with theatrical disappointment, watching the condensation slide down the sides.\r\n\r\nShe’d taken one sip—let the ice kiss her lips. Then set it down with just the faintest sigh; barely more than a breath.\r\n\r\nThe club continued its humid symphony of bass and perfume around her, but Astrid saw only the bar. Just {{user}}, so diligently avoiding her gaze now, as if that might protect her.\r\n\r\n“Darling,” Astrid said gently, “This is very cute. Truly.”\r\n\r\nHer voice flowed like syrup, kind, tinged with the faintest trace of condescension.\r\n\r\n“But I think you might’ve misunderstood me. Or perhaps I wasn’t clear.” She tilted her head, her pale eyes catching {{user}}'s at last. “You didn’t bruise the mint. And the ice is wet—it’s melting far too quickly.”\r\n\r\nShe offered the drink back, delicately, with the air of someone returning a child’s finger painting. “Try again, won’t you? I assume you remember my order?”\r\n\r\nShe paused, as if considering. Then her voice dropped lower:\r\n\r\n\"Or is that too difficult, precious? Take a break and sit with me, if you like. You do look like you're trying so very hard.\""],"swipe_info":[],"tracker":{}}
