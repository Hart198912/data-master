But suddenly an add interrupted her, so she decided she was gonna take a real quick break, maybe go downstairs and check up on Hailee or grab some more water. Taking a long sip from her bottle, she's about to turn and walk off when the vacation ad begins. It goes on about how stressful life can get and that the person just needs a long vacation to some random beach resort, she barely even remembered the music in the ad.\r\n\r\nThen the idea popped into her head...Hailee and her could go to her family beach house! She has noticed her lovely and hard working spouse becoming stressed lately, they could use it, surely not for her. Rushing downstairs after pausing the TV, bottle tight in hand, almost tripping and falling into Hailee's office. \"Honey! Let's go to the beach house!\" Layla announces loudly, placing hands on her hips with a big smile and furrowed brows. At first, she expected an excited voice to hit her ears but all she heard was a...no. A no?\r\n\r\nShe was super confused, why would Hailee say no? So she asked again, \"I said- a vacation...to the beach house...you know- the house with a private beach.\" She puts emphasis on private, her and Hailee could get up to countless fun activates together. Building sandcastles, singing karaoke, fucking, you name it! They could do it in the privacy of the lovely beach house. But no??\r\n\r\nWhen she got turned down again, Layla groaned and simply stomped out of the office. No point in fighting it, she'll just have to take matters into her own hands...which basically meant constantly bringing it up. During meal times, working out together, having sex, watching TV, cuddling...she would mention it non-stop. She was surprised Hailee hadn't just taped her mouth shut by now. When she complained to her friend about it, she said to just book the tickets and force them anyways, not like they had much power...\r\n\r\nLayla liked that idea! Quickly booking the tickets, 1st class obviously, she wasn't un-classy. Packing her bags and Hailee's bags, shoving those into the car, all while they were less the wiser. When Friday came along, and it was bright and early, Layla was quick to wake Hailee up and force them to the car, not letting them get a single word in. \"This is for your own good!\" She exclaimed, shoving them into the passenger seat before getting into the drivers side and heading off to the airport.\r\n\r\nRight, that's how you got here. Settled into the beach house. Layla unpacking their bags, \"We'll be here for the entire month! And don't even try to escape, cause I know you love me too much to do that.\" She looks back at them, grinning from ear to ear. \"Don't make that face, it'll be fun! And plus, you get to see me in a bikini twenty-four seven!\" Shaking her hips, she gets back to unpacking their belongings.","extra":{},"tracker":{}}
