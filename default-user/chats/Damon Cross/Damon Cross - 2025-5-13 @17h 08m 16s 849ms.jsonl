But none of my previous muse could hold a candle to you. Your expression was... top-tier.\" His grin widened, revealing a glimpse of his sharp canines. \"I'm so very glad you only show such exquisite vulnerability to me.\"\r\n\r\nBut the charming facade was a delicate thing, a mask he donned and discarded at his whim. Beneath it lurked a controlling monster, fueled by obsession and a twisted notion of love.\r\n\r\n*You little bitch, did you really think you could escape me?* His eyes flashed with a terrifying intensity as the thought crossed his mind. His grip tightened on the paintbrush, his knuckles turning white as he fought the urge to snap it in half.\r\n\r\n\"I'm going to paint the both of us,\" he declared, setting the canvas aside. \"Together, just like that perfect moment when I caught up to you. When my fangs sank into your tender throat, and my fingers... Punishing your soaked little cunt.\" His voice dropped to a guttural rasp, thick with lust and dark promise.\r\n\r\nHe rose to his feet and stalked towards you, his gaze never leaving your restrained form. Reaching out, he cupped your cheek, his thumb tracing the curve of your lips almost tenderly. \"Stop running away from me,\" he commanded, his other hand trailing down the column of your throat, feeling your pulse.\r\n\r\nHis fingers curled around your chin, tilting your face up to meet his burning gaze. \"I may just lose my patience, and punish you harder every time. And you wouldn't want that, now would you?\" He leaned in closer, his lips brushing against yours as he spoke.\r\n\r\n\"You're mine, you dirty dirty girl.\" he growled, his hand sliding down to splay across your collarbones. \"Every. Last. Drop.\" His other hand crept between your thighs, his fingers teasing the slick flesh of your pussy beneath your gown. \"Of your blood. Of your body. These holes...\" He punctuated each word with a sharp thrust of his fingers, parting your folds, claiming what he believed to be rightfully his.\r\n\r\nHis mouth found your neck, his tongue laving over the bite mark he'd left upon your tender skin. \"You're my muse, my lover, my everything. I did everything for you, my dear. I went to great lengths to keep the two of us together.\" His hand slid higher, his thumb finding your clit and circling the sensitive nub with ruthless intent.\r\n\r\n\"So please, stop deluding yourself that I'm the villain here. I've shown you nothing but devotion. Now...\" He nipped sharply at your jaw, his voice dropping to a low, dangerous purr. \"Be a good girl and stop trying to leave me. If you want me to be nice, to keep my patience... Do not provoke me again.\"","extra":{"display_text":"\"See this, my love?\" he cooed, his voice dripping with a sickening sweetness. \"I was always gifted with a painter's touch.
