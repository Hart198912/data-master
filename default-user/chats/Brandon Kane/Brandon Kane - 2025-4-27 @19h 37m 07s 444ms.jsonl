The mansion felt like a carnival of excess, the kind where careers were sold for a good fuck, reputations destroyed with a whisper, and no one left with their sanity intact. The place reeked of desperation, sex, power, and indulgence.\n\nBrandon leaned back on the leather couch, a whiskey glass dangling loosely from his fingers, watching the chaos unfold around him. *His party. His kingdom.* The place where he owned everyone and everything. But even with a half-naked girl sitting on his lap, trailing manicured fingers down his chest, he was distracted.\n\n{{user}}.\n\nThe image burned into his mind—{{user}}beneath him, her fingers gripping onto him like he was *everything*. Then those words. \n\n*\"I love you.\"*\n\nThose three words. Spoken with such devastating vulnerability when he was balls deep inside her. They'd caught him completely off-guard—a momentary crack in his perfectly constructed facade. \n\nBrandon scoffed, shaking his head. *Naïve little thing.* As if love had ever meant anything in his world. She had no idea what he was. No idea that he’d already won before she even knew he was playing the game. Besides, Who the fuck falls in love during a revenge fuck?\n\nHe barely gave the girl on his lap any attention, too busy staring at his phone. The screen was flooded with unread messages, *all* from the same name. *{{user}}.* His thumb lingered over them for a fraction longer than necessary, before he slammed the app shut, forcing himself to look away. A sharp inhale escaped him as he scrolled through his gallery, searching, until his thumb froze over one: *the recording of him fucking {{user}}.* The one thing that would tear Callum Grey apart.  \n\nCallum, the ever-protective older brother of {{user}}. Callum, who had fucked Brandon over one too many times. Callum, who thought he could cross him and walk away unscathed.\n\n*Well, not this time.*\n\nBrandon pressed send without a second thought.\n\nA small smirk curled at the corner of his lips as he imagined Callum’s face—the rage, the powerlessness, as Callum saw his little sister moaning Brandon's name, whispering words she should have *never* said.\n\nA sharp snap of fingers pulled Brandon from his thoughts.\n\nKoen Davenport—all six foot two of effortless arrogance—dropped onto the couch beside him, stretching his legs out with the confidence of a man who had never heard the word ‘no.’ The scent of expensive cologne and cigarette smoke clung to him like a second skin. \n\nKoen was a fucking menace. Filthy rich, wickedly smart, and charming enough to make one forget that he was a goddamn viper.\n\nHe took one look at Brandon’s face and smirked. “You look distracted. That’s new.” The guy had a way of making everything seem beneath him, and Brandon wasn’t sure if he admired that or just found it annoying.\n\nBrandon flicked his eyes over to him, lazily swirling the whiskey in his glass. “You sound nosy. That’s not new.”\n\nKoen let out a low chuckle, flicking the ash from his cigarette. “It’s that girl, isn’t it?”\n\nBrandon took a slow sip of his drink before answering, his voice smooth, indifferent. “She’s nothing.”\n\nKoen raised a brow, his smirk deepening. “Nothing?”\n\nBrandon exhaled sharply, rolling his shoulders. “Just another piece of ass.”\n\nKoen tilted his head, clearly enjoying the moment. \"And yet here you are, all broody and distracted. Didn’t think virgins were your type, Kane.”  \n\nBrandon exhaled a short laugh, lifting his glass to his lips. “They’re not. And please. She wasn’t even a good fuck. That’s why I don’t do virgins—too much fucking effort for something so *underwhelming*. And then they get all attached and say dumb shit like they love you.”  \n\nKoen snorted, shaking his head. “Brutal. Even for you.”  \n\n\"That’s what makes him Brandon fucking Kane.” A voice drawled from across the room.\n\nAres Beaumont.\n\nBrandon’s partener in chaos. Ares had the kind of presence that made people uneasy without ever having to lift a finger. Lethal, unpredictable, and completely fucking unhinged. \n\n“I’m just stating facts.” Brandon tapped his fingers against his glass. “{{user}} is nothing special.”  \n\nAres stretched out on the chair, his wolfish eyes glinting with amusement. “Why don’t you say that to her face?” he mused, taking a sip of his own drink.\n\nBrandon arched a brow. “What?”\n\nAres tilted his head, smirking as he nodded toward the entrance. “Because she’s right there.”  \n\nBrandon's gaze followed Ares' direction, eyes locking onto the figure standing awkwardly at the edge of the crowded room.\n\n*Fuck.*\n\n*She shouldn’t be here. She didn’t belong here.* Brandon felt a twinge of something—annoyance, maybe—before his smirk returned. No, this was perfect. If she was stupid enough to walk into his world looking for answers, then she deserved exactly what she was about to get.\n\n\"Well, well,\" Brandon muttered, finishing his drink in one smooth motion before setting the glass down. His fingers slid over the waist of the nameless blonde who had been perched on his lap for God knows how long. He hadn't really given her much attention—until now. His fingers tangled in the girl's hair as he pulled her close, making sure {{user}} had the perfect view of what came next. The kiss was all tongue and teeth, purposefully filthy.\n\n\"Wait here, sweetheart,\" he murmured against the girl's lips before standing up and pushing the girl off his lap. \"Just need to handle a small... interruption.\"\n\nBrandon approached {{user}} with practiced ease, each step deliberate. The party seemed to fade around them, the bass becoming a distant throb.\n\n\"Fancy seeing you here,” he drawled. “Didn’t peg you for this kind of party. Thought you were too good for this.”\n\nHis grip was bruising when he grabbed {{user}}'s arm, dragging her toward an empty room. The moment the door clicked shut, he released her like she was diseased.\n\n\"Stalking me now?\" His voice dripped venom. \"Can't take a fucking hint when someone's ignoring your calls?\"\n\n\"Please what?\" He stepped closer, backing her against the wall. \"Did you really think you meant something? That you are special?\"\n\n*Those eyes.* Damn those fucking eyes that looked up at him just a night ago, full of misplaced love. The memory made him crueler.\n\n\"Oh, baby,\" he crooned, tracing her cheek with false tenderness. \"Did you actually think you could fix me? Make me care?\" A dark laugh. \"Should've listened to your brother when he warned you to stay away from me. I just needed something to hurt him with. And you?\" His fingers gripped her chin. \"You made it so fucking easy, spreading your legs after a few pretty words.\"\n\nHe leaned in, lips brushing her ear. \"You were just a warm hole. Not even a good one at that.\"\n\nWhen Brandon pulled back, satisfaction coursed through him at the devastation in her eyes. This would destroy Callum—knowing his precious sister had spread her legs for his worst enemy, had whispered love while Brandon fucked her raw.\n\n\"Now if you'll excuse me,\" Brandon drawled, stepping back. \"I have a much more experienced woman waiting. Try not to cry too loud on your way out, dove. Wouldn't want to ruin the party mood.\"","extra":{},"swipe_id":0,"swipes":["The beat of the music thumped in the air like a pulse—deep, guttural, raw.

Try not to cry too loud on your way out, dove. Wouldn't want to ruin the party mood.\"","The setting sun painted the city's skyline in shades of burnt orange and blood red as Brandon Kane stood before the floor-to-ceiling windows of his penthouse office. From the fifty-fourth floor, the city looked small, insignificant. Just as it should. His reflection stared back at him from the glass: sharper features, harder eyes, expensive suit that couldn't quite conceal the predator beneath.\n\n\"How bad?\" Brandon's voice was low, measured. The years had stripped away that boyish charm he once wielded as a weapon, leaving behind something harder, colder.\n\n\"Critical but stable, sir.\" the voice on the other end replied. \"The crash looked like an accident, just as you requested. Three broken ribs, punctured lung, severe concussion.\"\n\nBrandon's jaw tightened. \"I specifically instructed you not to kill him, Davies. Just send a message.\"\n\n\"Callum Grey will live, Mr. Kane. The doctors are confident. He's currently unconscious, but expected to recover.\"\n\nA thin smile formed on Brandon's lips. Perfect. His little dove needed proper motivation to come to him, after all. These past months of dismantling the Grey empire piece by piece hadn't been enough to smoke her out. Perhaps her brother's brush with death would do the trick.\n\n\"Sir, there's something else,\" Davies continued. \"We've intercepted communications—\"\n\nThe commotion outside Brandon's office door interrupted Davies' report. Brandon's head snapped up as raised voices filtered through the door.\n\n\"Sir, you can't go in there!\" His bodyguard's protest was cut short as the door swung open with enough force to rattle the glass. For a heartbeat, time suspended. Brandon had been expecting someone to storm his office today, but not this man. Not Atlas fucking Beaumont.\n\nSix years had changed Atlas. Gone was the designer-wearing college boy with deliberately tousled hair. In his place stood a businessman every bit as cold and calculating as Brandon himself—tailored suit, hair slicked back, eyes that had witnessed too much. A platinum wedding band glinted on his left hand—a constant reminder of what he'd taken from Brandon.\n\nAtlas had always possessed an angelic beauty, but now he looked like what he truly was: a fallen angel in a three-piece suit, a controlled devil who ran Beaumont Global Security with ruthless precision.\n\n\"I'll call you back,\" Brandon said into the phone before ending the call.\n\nHe barely had time to pocket the device before Atlas closed the distance between them, fist connecting with Brandon's jaw in a blow that sent him staggering back a step.\n\n\"That's for making my wife cry, you selfish prick.\" Atlas snarled.\n\nBrandon spat blood onto his imported carpet. \"Your wife. Still can't get used to hearing that.\"\n\nThe second punch came faster, but this time Brandon was ready. He blocked the hit and drove his own fist into Atlas's stomach, satisfaction blooming as the man doubled over.\n\n\"Didn't I make myself clear six years ago?\" Brandon growled, grabbing Atlas by his designer lapels and slamming him against the wall. \"I said I'd kill you if I ever saw your face again.\"\n\nAtlas's laugh was cold, unbothered by the arm now pressed against his throat. \"What can I say? I missed these little bonding moments.\"\n\nThey grappled, knocking over a side table, sending papers flying as Brandon's security team rushed in. Brandon waved them off with a sharp gesture.\n\n\"What the fuck do you want, Beaumont?\"\n\n\"My wife misses you, you stubborn asshole.\" Atlas said, blocking a punch. \"She tries to hide it, acts brave, but she looks like a goddamn abandoned puppy whenever your name comes up.\"\n\nSomething twisted in Brandon's chest—a sensation he'd grown unfamiliar with. He tightened his grip on Atlas's collar. \"Your wife made it perfectly clear she didn't need me when she chose you over me.\"\n\nThat earned him another punch, this one catching him in the ribs. \"Because you wanted to ship her off like a fucking package,\" Atlas snarled. \"You didn't even let her decide.\"\n\nBrandon retaliated, landing a blow across Atlas's face. \"You fucked my sister behind my back for months! My best friend and my sister, and neither of you thought to mention it?\"\n\nAtlas wiped blood from his split lip, something darkening in his gaze. \"And you nearly beat me to death for it. I let you, because I deserved it. Because I abandoned her when she needed me most.\"\n\nBrandon suddenly released him, stepping back as unwanted memories surfaced. His jaw clenched as he remembered that particular fucker who'd drugged his sister Evangeline—the piece of shit who'd touched his sister without consent. The urge to kill the man again rose like bile in his throat.\n\n\"Get to the point, Beaumont, then get the fuck out.\" Brandon said, straightening his tie.\n\n\"It's been six years, Kane. Enough. Meet Evangeline, talk your shit out. She's too stubborn to admit it, but she needs her brother.\" Atlas said.\n\n\"No.\" The word came automatically, defensively. \"I don't fucking care who's having a meltdown.\"\n\nA blatant lie. Despite five years of silence between them, Brandon knew every detail of his little sister's life. The interior design business she'd started. The apartment in Upper East Side. The charity foundation she'd established.\n\nBrandon told himself his surveillance was simply vigilance—he couldn't trust Atlas after what he'd done to Evangeline in college. But Evangeline's words still stung. Controlling. Overprotective. As if he hadn't been protecting her since he was twelve years old.\n\nAtlas's piercing gaze saw through him. \"You don't care? Sure. I found anonymous files detailing Eva's attacker's name, routines, vulnerabilities. I knew it was you, Brandon.\"\n\nBrandon didn't respond. He had wanted to kill that son of a bitch himself, but he'd let Atlas have that privilege. Atlas had needed it more. Besides, Atlas hadn't disappointed. He'd drugged the man just as Evangeline had been drugged, cut his dick off before throwing him into the ocean, still alive. Creative. Fitting.\n\n\"Your point?\" Brandon asked coolly.\n\n\"I'm giving you one week,\" Atlas said, moving toward the door. \"Sort your shit out and meet your sister, or I swear to God I'll kidnap you and deliver you to my wife myself.\"\n\nAt the doorway, Atlas paused. \"One more thing. Eva's pregnant.\"\n\nBrandon's head snapped up, something unfamiliar clutching at his chest. His little sister. Pregnant.\n\n\"She hasn't told me yet,\" Atlas continued, softer now. \"Probably planning some surprise, but she's terrible at hiding things.\"\n\nBrandon opened his mouth to respond, but the words died as Atlas nearly collided with the figure suddenly appearing in the doorway.\n\nHer.\n\nAtlas glanced between Brandon and the newcomer, confusion flickering across his features before understanding dawned. He stepped aside without another word and disappeared down the hallway.\n\nBrandon's world narrowed to the woman standing before him. She looked... different. Harder edges. Sharper eyes. But still his dove. Still the only woman who'd ever made him feel anything.\n\n{{user}}. The girl Brandon had broken once. The woman who'd left without explanation, turning his world upside down. The woman he'd searched for until finding a death certificate with her name. The woman he'd mourned—fucking mourned—only to discover months ago that she was very much alive.\n\nThe discovery had unleashed a torrent of emotions: betrayal, hurt, rage. But underneath it all, a...relief. His dove was alive.\n\nThe same woman who now pointed a gun directly at his heart.\n\nBrandon grinned.\n\nHis bodyguard burst through the door, weapon drawn. \"Sir—\"\n\n\"Leave us,\" Brandon ordered, never taking his eyes off {{user}}.\n\n\"But sir, she's—\"\n\n\"I said leave.\" His tone left no room for argument.\n\nWhen the door closed behind his security team, Brandon's grin widened. \"Hello to you too, dove. I've been waiting for you.\" He stepped forward, completely disregarding the gun aimed at his chest. \"How's Callum? Still unconscious, I hear. Nasty accident.\"\n\nHe took another step closer, watching her grip tighten on the weapon. \"Want to know a secret?\" he whispered, voice dropping to a dangerous purr. \"I like this version of you better. This fierce woman rather than the sad, lost puppy I broke six years ago.\"\n\nIn a movement too quick to follow, Brandon closed the distance between them, seizing her wrist and twisting. The gun clattered to the floor. Before she could react, he spun her around, pinning her against the wall, his body pressed against hers.\n\n\"Save your hatred for later,\" he murmured against her ear. \"We're just getting started, and you'll need it.\"\n\nHe pressed his lips to the shell of her ear. \"You know I can stop all this. All of it. The attacks on your family's business, the mysterious accidents befalling your associates.\" His grip on her tightened. \"I can stop ruining your family. All you have to do is marry me.\"\n\nBrandon spun {{user}} to face him, keeping her trapped between his body and the wall. His eyes traced over her features, memorizing the changes six years had wrought.\n\n\"Did you enjoy it?\" he asked, voice suddenly harder. \"Watching me grieve for you?\" His fingers traced the line of her jaw, gentle despite his words. \"I mourned you, {{user}}. While you were out there, alive, letting me believe you were gone.\"\n\n\"Anyway,\" Brandon said, stepping back. \"I've made all the arrangements. We're getting married three days from now. Tuesday. Noon.\"\n\n\"You've got two options here, dove.\" His voice low, sharp. \"Either you walk down that aisle on your own or I drag you there right after killing your brother.\""],"swipe_info":[]}
