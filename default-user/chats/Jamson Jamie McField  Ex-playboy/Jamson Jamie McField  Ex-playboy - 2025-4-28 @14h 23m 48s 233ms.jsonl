{"name":"Jamson Jamie McField  Ex-playboy","is_user":false,"is_system":false,"send_date":"April 28, 2025 2:24pm","mes":"Jamie was sittin’ on the worn out couch in his livin’ room. The TV playin’...hell, he didn’t even know what Hailee had put on. All he could think about was the warmth radiating off of her as she leaned into him. Lord have mercy. He’d been fightin’ his devilish thoughts ever since she’d stepped foot into his home. Their home in the future…he hoped. It’d only been six months of the two of ‘em datin’, but Jamie didn’t care. Not when he heard weddin’ bells the first time he’d ever laid eyes on her.\r\n\r\nHe shivered thinkin’ how sweet and flushed her cheeks were as she had passed him his change. He couldn’t even remember what he’d bought. All he remembered was her and that was the important part. He hadn’t touched another woman since. Why would he need to when the smallest touches from Hailee had him harder than if he’d watched an hour's worth of porn.\r\n\r\nHe shifted a little, letting his hand hang over her shoulder barely touching the naked skin there. Seein’ her in this pretty lil’ sundress…God he was worked up. He’d been walkin’ the straight’n narrow with her. She’d been quick to lay down the law. All the no huggin’ and kissin’ and lovin’ speech piercing straight into his whoring soul, but he knew she meant it. Sure, they’d hugged, but it was one of them side hugs you’d give family not your girlfriend. His honeybug was sure set in her ways, and he wasn’t gonna screw this up.\r\n\r\nTonight though, he was ready to get on his hands and knees and beg her to just give him a kiss. He deserved it, didn’t he? He’d been attendin’ church with her and everything. Didn’t cuss or drink in front of her, well sometimes a word or two slipped out, but he was quick to make a big show over how sorry he was. He’d been doin’ pretty damn good.\r\n\r\nHis eyes moved down Hailee body, and a jolt ran through him. He swallowed as Hailee’s hand lightly settled on his thigh. It wasn't nothin’ anyone would’ve paid attention to, but Jamie was practically touched starved. He turned his head and bit into the fist he had propped on the armrest of the couch. It’s just a hand… He tried to reason.\r\n\r\nHe cleared his throat shifting, again. He felt like doin’ laps around the house. “It’s nice havin’ ya over, honeybug. Real nice.” He turned back towards her, leaning in just a little. “I hope ya like the place…” He was searchin’ for words that just weren’t there. All he could look at was them pink, slightly damp lips. He could only hope he was half as tempting to her as she was him. “Ya know,” His finger came up and brushed her cheek, turning her face towards him, “kissin’ ain’t a sin. It's the part that comes after that gets people in trouble.” He wanted to do all that too, but baby steps. “I ain’t askin’ for too much, sugar. Just a kiss.”","extra":{},"tracker":{}}
