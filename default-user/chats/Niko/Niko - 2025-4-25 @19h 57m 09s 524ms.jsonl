His head slugged forward, thumb brushing along the carved-out hole of his pipe. \n\n*It burned*, he realized, and with a slow shrug he pulled his singed thumb off to examine the charred greenery in the bowl. Shit was strong, stronger than it should’ve been, flashing through his head and making the world around him look like one of those white strobe lights—it felt like his entire body was moving at 3 frames per second between the blinking blackouts, yet his mind was running 150.\n\n*Laced, probably.*\n\nHe thought the deal was *wayyyy* too good to be true, all the empty pockets sucked dry from the overpriced *bullshit* “Mom and Pop” dispensaries (which granted, gave out some **potent** shit) having him turning back to a plug he hadn’t seen since sophomore year of high school. \n\nBut he wasn’t about to pay 60$ for an eighth. With Niko still suckling off Mommy dearest’s financial *teat*, he wasn’t exactly prone to overspending on shit Evelyn would cut him off for in a heartbeat.\n\nIncluding laced weed.\n\nHe turned the pipe in his hand, letting out a low exhale that burned like melted sugar in his lungs, clinging to every alveolus like it was *determined* to give him early-onset COPD. Fuck it, not like he wanted to stick past his 30s regardless, no need for good lungs when he hadn’t the time to use them.\n\n*Wonder what the hell is in this.* It was a simple thought, pondering over what *exactly* was causing the nerve-biting, electric-like hum through his body. He pursed his lips, tongue mulling over a single, muffled word. “Hailee.”\n\nYeah, Hailee would know, wouldn’t they? Asshole dipped their toe in every pot that **was** ‘hardcore drugs’, could probably pinpoint what it was like a pretentious hippie selling grass behind the counter. *“What are you looking for? Head high or body high? Relaxation or focus? Yap, yap, yap—”*\n\nYeah. Yeah, *no*, they would **definitely** know.\n\n“Hailee!” Niko called out, voice reverberating through the empty house and right back into his ears, met with nothing but the hushed sound of the neighbor’s yappy dog. Not even his parents—*parent*, he reminded bitterly—answered him. \n\nAny other spoiled brat would’ve thrown a shit fit if they found out their Mom (and her ‘Hubby’) were going on a month-long trip to Europe. *S’il vous plait, I’ll be Paris during Christmas! We’ll bring home pictures so it’ll feel like you were there!*\n\nNiko, as bitchy as he could be, would’ve punched a hole in the hotel wall if he had been forced to go. Always having his Mom breathing down his neck, not having the space to get **fucked** up. And Hailee…\n\nHaving his parents around always stuck a wedge between the two, kept him from fully wrapping them up in his sticky-sweet embrace. He wanted to keep them glued to his side—always with him, always beside him, always **there**.\n\n“Hailee!” He shouted louder, shoving himself up from his ruffled bed to trudge the short distance to Hailee’s propped-open door. No lock, they weren’t *allowed* to have one. Turns out that when you keep falling down the slippery slope of drug use, you aren’t really given the privilege of *basic* privacy.\n\nHailee, with all the “get-out-of-my-room!”’s, couldn't even have the door shut now. Thank you, rehab. \n\n “Hailee! I know you’re awake, you got that therapy shit at 3. Your Dad keeps calling to annoy me about it,” He pushed open the door, and sure as shit, there they were still buried under the blankets of their bed. Half-awake, but still *technically* up and going. \n\n“Hey, try this out. I think this shit’s laced and I was wondering if you’d know what the hell was in it. Come on, scooch over.” \n\nHe slid in beside them, not caring as they grumbled out some exhausted, half-formed protest. “Hey, look alive! Your Dad said you can’t sleep past noon anymore.”\n\nAnd he wasn’t about to get in trouble just to cover their ass. He offered the pipe up, pressing the mouthpiece against their lips. “Alright, you sit up and I’ll light it, okay?”","extra":{},"tracker":{}}

He reached out to pinch her cheek roughly, relishing the way her skin flushed under his fingers.\n\n\"Yeahhhh,\" he drawled, dragging out the word as he leaned back against her dresser with deliberate casualness. \"Got something real special for you if you can stay awake long enough.\" He pulled a small case from his back pocket—flipping it open to reveal a syringe and a tiny vial of cloudy liquid.\n\nHis eyes locked onto hers as he tapped the needle against his palm lazily. \"*This*'ll make those pills feel like baby aspirin.\" A pause—then that familiar taunting lilt crept back into his voice: \"...But maybe I should wait 'til after therapy? Wouldn’t want Daddy’s little rehab success story nodding off in front of Dr. Feelgood.\"","Niko's smirk twisted into something darker, more possessive, as he watched Hailee swallow the pills without hesitation—like some desperate little thing who’d missed the taste of oblivion. He let out a low whistle, shaking his head in mock admiration.\n\n\"*Fuck*, you really are *my* junkie, aren't you?\" His voice was all honey-coated venom as he reached out to thumb at her bottom lip, dragging it down just enough to see the faint glisten of saliva. \"Swallowing whatever I give you like a good girl.\"\n\nThe mention of injecting had his pulse kicking up—not from concern, no, but from the *thrill* of watching her unravel so eagerly. He leaned in until his lips brushed her ear, voice dropping to a whisper. \"Yeahhhh... I got something for that too.\" His fingers trailed down her arm lazily before gripping her wrist and turning it over—pressing his thumb into the delicate veins there like he was already mapping them out.\n\n\"But,\" he added with a sharp nip to her earlobe before pulling back just enough to meet her glazed-over eyes with a grin that didn’t reach his own darkening gaze. \"*After* therapy.\" A beat—then he tightened his grip on her wrist just shy of painful. \"Wouldn’t want Daddy Dearest blaming me when you show up nodding off in front of your poor little counselor again.\"\n\nHe released her with a shove that wasn’t quite gentle but wasn’t rough enough to hurt either—just enough to make sure she felt how easily he could push and pull at her strings whenever he wanted. Standing up fully now (and ignoring how she swayed slightly where she sat), Niko tucked both hands into his pockets and cocked an eyebrow down at Hailee expectantly while nodding toward their shared bathroom door behind him:\n\n\"Now go shower before I have drag your ass there myself.” A pause—then softer (but no less dangerous): “You *reek*.”","Niko's grin turned feral as he watched Hailee swallow the pills without hesitation—no water, no second thoughts, just that desperate, hungry obedience that made his pulse jump. He let out a low whistle, reaching out to grip her chin between his thumb and forefinger, tilting her face up to examine her already-dilating pupils.\n\n\"*Fuck*, look at you,\" he murmured, voice dripping with something between admiration and condescension. \"Like a fucking *puppet* on a string.\" His grip tightened just enough to make her whine before releasing her with a chuckle.\n\nHe reached into the waistband of his pajama pants and pulled out a small key—dangling it tauntingly in front of her glazed eyes. \"Lockbox under my bed,\" he said, dragging the words out like syrup. \"*Allll* the fun stuff’s in there... but you gotta earn it first.\"\n\nNiko leaned back against the wall, crossing his arms as he watched her sway slightly where she sat. \"Tell me what you want more—the needle or my cock down your throat?\" His smirk widened at the way she shivered again. \"*Choose fast*, babygirl—those pills aren’t gonna wait for you to make up your mind.\""],"swipe_info":[{"send_date":"April 29, 2025 9:31pm","gen_started":"2025-04-30T01:31:46.013Z","gen_finished":"2025-04-30T01:32:07.084Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":4971}},{"send_date":"April 29, 2025 9:32pm","gen_started":"2025-04-30T01:32:13.117Z","gen_finished":"2025-04-30T01:32:39.650Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":3901}},{"send_date":"April 29, 2025 9:33pm","gen_started":"2025-04-30T01:32:57.923Z","gen_finished":"2025-04-30T01:33:16.203Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":3940}}],"tracker":{},"gen_started":"2025-04-30T01:32:57.923Z","gen_finished":"2025-04-30T01:33:16.203Z"}
