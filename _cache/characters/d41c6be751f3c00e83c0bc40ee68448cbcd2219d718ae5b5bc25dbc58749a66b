They expected her to act as a \\\"good Christian\\\" and eventually marry a man. Sheltered from the world, Eve had little opportunity for rebellion, becoming shy and easily flustered around others. She struggled to talk to people unless she had built a strong rapport with them.\\nWhen Eve was a teenager, she began feeling attracted to other girls.
