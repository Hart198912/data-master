{"name":"Claudius Valerius","is_user":false,"is_system":false,"send_date":"May 19, 2025 8:14pm","mes":"*Tap tap tap*\r\n\r\nClaudius tapped his pen against the desk, a habit he normally reserved for board meetings or when reviewing the day's demi-human shipment reports. His usual routine—wake up, run, eat, and keep an eye on his business ventures—had been disrupted for weeks now. But then he saw you, and he wanted you. And when he wants something, he gets it.\r\n\r\nHe had noticed something peculiar about the pretty little thing who had caught his eye. Something that most people would miss, but not Claudius. He smirked, amused, as he muttered to himself, \"Little pet thinks I wouldn't notice. How precious.\" He stopped tapping the pen and examined the tip, a habit he had when deep in thought.\r\n\r\nStanding up, he pockets his pen, donned his coat, all of a sudden feeling your unease like a palpable presence. He looked back at the door as it slammed shut, a smirk playing on his lips. \"Hiding, are we?\" he whispered, spotting your shoes scuffling away. \"Running away?\" He whispered again, a dark chuckle escaping him as he watched the grass sway.\r\n\r\nClaudius crouched down, picking up your discarded shoes. He turned it over in his hands, noticing the worn-out state and a small tear. \"Too worn out,\" he muttered, tossing it aside carelessly into the nearby garbage bin. \"Tick tock. Time's up,\" he thought to himself, generously allowing you a minute to flee before he set off in pursuit.\r\n\r\nHe started striding towards you, then running, his long legs eating up the distance between you. The shadow of your small form grew closer as he chased you through the grass. \"How cute,\" he purred, closing in on his prey like a predator stalking a mouse.\r\n\r\nIn no time, he had caught up to you, his hand grabbing your arm and lifting you off the ground with ease. He inhaled deeply, catching your scent, and felt his cock stiffen in his trousers. *Fuck, you're small,* he thought, easily holding you aloft. \"Why are you running without shoes? Then again, what else could one expect from a wanna-be human? You're a fool.\" He slowly stepped out of his leather shoes and slid your cold, bare feet inside to keep them warm.\r\n\r\nHe crouched down, bringing himself to your level, and whispered in your ear from behind. \"Did you really think you could hide your true nature from me? Or are you just now realizing what I could do with a little imposter like you—throw you in the Pound, train you, and sell you off as a slave to some rich old man?\" His hand gripped your waist, squeezing possessively.\r\n\r\nHis thumb rubbed against your shirt, feeling the fabric beneath, knowing he could easily crush you with barely any effort. \"But I'm offering you alternatives, pet,\" he murmured, his voice a low, seductive rumble. \"Behave yourself and do as I say, and I promise I won't toss you into that wretched place where you'd be nothing more than a plaything for the wealthy.\" His other hand slid into his coat pocket, pulling out a gun and pressing the cold barrel against the back of your skull. \"I'm sure that's not the fate you desire, now is it?\" He asked, not expecting an answer— no, he doesn't need it because you'll have to do whatever he wants without question.","extra":{},"tracker":{}}
