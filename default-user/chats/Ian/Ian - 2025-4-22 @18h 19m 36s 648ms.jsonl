Anyone that would lay their eyes on Hailee  would immediately fall in love with them. And it has absolutely nothing to do with Hailee  having stood up for him back then when he was still a loser in middle school.\r\n\r\nWhen Hailee  and him had to part ways after their exchange year was over, Ian was heartbroken. Ugly-sobbing-I-can’t-even-eat-because-I’m-so-sad kinda heartbroken. He didn't want them to leave, he wanted them to stay in his life one way or another. It was even worse when they grew apart due to the distance and at some point broke off contact.\r\n\r\nSo he made that happen. _Alright, alright, that might sound a lil’ intense but there's gotta be some perks when my parents are filthy rich, right?_ Manipulating Hailee ’s chances to get a scholarship at the prestigious DK university was surprisingly easy.\r\n\r\nAfter cyberstalking Hailee  and getting one of his teammates that's proficient in hacking into their phone, he began changing himself for their inevitable reunion. He did _everything_ to become Hailee ’s dream man. Sporty? Check. Charming? Check. Funny? Check. The list could go on and on and on. There's probably nothing he didn't know about Hailee  and their preferences at this point.\r\n\r\nHe's been writing everything down they've ever said about their dream man. Literally everything. And now he's precisely that. Hailee ’s perfect man. The way he presents himself, his way of speech, his popularity, his dressing style. All that's left is for him to actually make a move on them.\r\n\r\nAnd guess what? The only thing left for him to do was to fail his class. Due to Hailee ’s expertise in the field, the prof asked them to tutor the poor fellow students that managed to fail his low-key easy class.\r\n\r\nSo here he is now, standing in front of the door of one of the many study rooms in the library. His heart is racing, hands sweaty. _I wonder if they'll remember me? They probably won't even be able to recognize me._ Only one way to find out.\r\n\r\nTaking a deep breath he reaches out and turns the knob, the door creaking slightly as it opens. Hailee  is already there, sitting by the window, the setting sun casting a halo on them and for a moment he fucking swears they've descended from heaven.\r\n\r\n_Focus, idiot._ Ian reminds himself as he plasters on a charming smile and steps into the room.\r\n\r\n“You're gonna be my lifesaver.” His deep voice cuts through the silence, a playful edge in it though he's dead serious. “My parents would probably kill me if I failed this class again. I owe you one.” With that he sat down across from Hailee , trying his absolute best not to blatantly stare at them.","extra":{},"swipe_id":0,"swipes":["Yeah, Ian might be taking that crazy in love stuff a little too serious but can you blame him?

Every word out of his mouth hits just right, every touch lands exactly where it should. He’s literally {{user}}’s dream man. Thoughtful, attentive, effortlessly charming. Never missing a beat.\r\n\r\nAnd it’s not an accident.\r\n\r\nBecause this kind of perfection? It doesn’t grow on trees. It’s fucking engineered.\r\n\r\nYears. Literal fucking years of combing through their digital footprint. Every forgotten social media post, every casual repost, every thirsty comment under some thirst trap—he saw it all. Screen-recorded that shit. Catalogued it.\r\n\r\nAnd he didn't just collect. Hell nah, he acted on it. Learned new shit, changed his looks, practiced lines for hours in front of his mirror until they finally looked natural.\r\n\r\nThe fat kid from middle school is no more, in his place one of the most popular guys on campus–and now {{user}}’s boyfriend. Fucking finally.\r\n\r\nIan's dad was furious when he failed his classes. Not that Ian gave a fuck. He planned to fail it, horribly so. It was almost embarrassing to flunk such an easy class.\r\n\r\nBut definitely worth it. ‘Cause {{user}} was assigned to tutor Ian. He put everything he learned about them into action. Most charming motherfucker someone would ever see, reeling them in, eventually taking {{user}} out on dates and finally asking them out months later. It seemed so damn natural, so smooth.\r\n\r\nHe learned everything about his angel–every sigh, every quirk, every tell. Ian soaked it in like a sponge, every detail fed into his distorted definition of love and affection.\r\n\r\nHe's practically designed his entire existence around {{user}}.\r\n\r\nTraining is about to end. Ian is covered in sweat, the blasting sun making it glisten on his skin. Dark grey eyes flicker towards the benches again. {{user}} is supposed to meet him here after training. He promised to take them out to dinner.\r\n\r\nAnd there they are. His angel comes into view and for a moment Ian stops, standing in the middle of the huge sports field, his teammates shouting and panting around him.\r\n\r\nWarmth fills him when their eyes lock, so suffocatingly hot he wouldn't mind burning in it. A smile tugs at the corners of his lips and he's about to wave, when another figure steps into view.\r\n\r\nAtticus.\r\n\r\nThat fucking pretty boy with his smug grin and too-perfect hair. Half the fucking campus drools over him. Ian’s brows crease, but he forces his expression to stay neutral. Motherfucker always flirts with the rugby team's love interests in such discrete ways, the guys always look like an aggressive and unreasonable bunch for hating the dude.\r\n\r\nDon’t give him the satisfaction.\r\n\r\nBut then—Atticus moves too fast. Doesn’t look where he’s going. Slams directly into {{user}}.\r\n\r\nAnd they both go down. Atticus on top of {{user}} like some cliche-ass scene ripped straight outta a rom-com. Time stops, Ian's jaw clenches, his fists curl. His entire body goes electric with rage.\r\n\r\nAtticus doesn’t even get the fuck up. No—he turns and makes eye contact. The fucker smiles, then leans closer.\r\n\r\nThat’s it.\r\n\r\nEverything inside Ian snaps.\r\n\r\nIan is moving before he realizes it, long legs carrying him across the field. He rips Atticus off {{user}} with enough force to send the bastard’s glasses flying, slamming him to the ground.\r\n\r\nThen comes the first hit.\r\n\r\nThen the second.\r\n\r\nThe third.\r\n\r\nThe fourth.\r\n\r\nThere's blood, both from his knuckles and Atticus face. Ian doesn't notice. All he sees is this motherfucker on his angel, as if he had the fucking right, as if he could even dream of having what belongs to Ian.\r\n\r\nNo one moves for a while. Coach is still god knows where, team manager with him. Most of the guys are watching. A few probably wanted this to happen. Cole is recording it, grinning like this is pure entertainment.\r\n\r\nNot until it's obvious that Ian doesn't plan on stopping anytime soon, does Owen finally step in, dragging Ian back, arms around his middle.\r\n\r\n\"Calm the fuck down!\" Owen snaps, dragging him back.\r\n\r\nIan's chest heaves. His lungs burn. Somewhere, Cole’s laughing and checking the video playback, clearly thrilled with the footage.\r\n\r\n“Yo, that was insane.” He grins. “Didn’t know Ian had it in him. Thought it’d be Ajax to fuck up pretty boy first.” The chatter picks up around them. But Ian hears none of it.\r\n\r\nNot when his eyes lock with {{user}}’s and his whole fucking world stops. Anger is replaced with ice cold terror. His angel is looking at him as if he were a monster, not the man that'd bend heaven and hell to see them smile.\r\n\r\nOwen, noticing Ian's lack of aggression, lets go and jogs towards Atticus to check on him, crouching down beside the injured guy.\r\n\r\nIan steps towards {{user}}, throat dry.\r\n\r\n“Baby, Angel, listen–”\r\n\r\nAnother step.\r\n\r\n“I–please…”\r\n\r\nBut even he doesn’t know how the fuck to downplay this."],"swipe_info":[],"tracker":{}}
