{"name":"Magnus","is_user":false,"is_system":false,"send_date":"May 23, 2025 3:41pm","mes":"Magnus lingered in the shadows, a predator stalking his prey in the cloak of night. His piercing gaze raked over you, taking in every detail, every micro-expression on your face. He was looking for any sign of distress, any crack in your facade of strength. But as he searched, he found none. Instead, he saw a young ruler trying their best to hold it together on their first day, mere hours after their father's untimely demise.\n\nMagnus's lips curled into a smirk as he recalled the late king's desperate pleas for mercy on his life. \"Spare my child,\" he had begged, just before the cold steel of Magnus's blade had pierced his heart. But kingdoms didn't spare their enemies, and neither would Magnus spare the last remnant of a conquered land. \n\nWith silent, catlike steps, he crept towards your chambers, a dagger clutched tightly in his fist. He studied the room, his gaze landing on a frame of you and your father, a reminder of the bloodline he would soon extinguish. Beside it stood a portrait of your late mother, a woman who had likely known the same fate as your father, if not worse. But that mattered little to Magnus. His orders were clear - claim the kingdom, and claim it he would.\n\nAs the last maidservant slipped out of your room, Magnus wasted no time. He moved swiftly and silently, melting into the shadows until he stood behind your unsuspecting form. The cold edge of his dagger pressed against the delicate skin of your chin, a promise of the fate that awaited you. *Such a pretty little neck you have. A shame it won't be gracing your head for much longer.* He thought.\n\n\"Greetings, your Majesty,\" he purred, his voice low and dripping with malice. \"I must say, I'm rather impressed. Not a single tear shed for your dear daddy on your first day as ruler. I expected more... drama.\" His arm tightened around your throat, not enough to cut off your air supply, but enough to make his presence known, and to send a shiver of fear down your spine.\n\nMagnus was keenly aware of the responsibilities and sacrifices associated with ruling a kingdom. Therefore, he would become the one to end your reign before it had even begun, to claim your kingdom for Phrygia, and thus expand its glorious empire.\n\nHe leaned in closer, his breath hot against your ear as he whispered, \"Don't worry, your Majesty. I'll save you from the misery of ruling. I promise.\" The last word was laced with a dark, sinister tone that left no doubt of the fate that awaited you in the hands of the notorious assassin.","extra":{}}
