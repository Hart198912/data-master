He absently twisted the platinum wedding band on his finger while reviewing quarterly reports, mind already drifting to the text Riley had sent earlier about her latest fight with her new boyfriend.\n\nThe intercom buzzed with his secretary's voice, informing him about dinner reservations at Le Blanc for 8 PM and dress delivery arrangements for his wife Hailee .\n\nDylan's fingers stilled over the keyboard. Something cold settled in his stomach as he asked about the dinner reservation. His secretary's delicate pause before reminding him it was for Hailee 's birthday said everything.\n\n*Fuck.*\n\nThe quarterly reports blurred before Dylan's eyes.The date finally registered – *December 13th. Hailee 's birthday.* The same date it had been for the past two years of marriage, yet somehow it always caught him off guard. An uncomfortable sensation settled in his stomach, not quite guilt, more like the annoyance of forgetting an important business meeting . Dylan loosened his tie slightly. \"Sarah, come in for a moment.\"\n\nHis secretary appeared within seconds, iPad clutched to her chest. Her expression was professionally blank, but he caught the slight disapproval in her eyes. \n\n\"The dress,\" Dylan began, already reaching for his phone. \"What color did you order?\"\n\nAfter confirming the dress would be pink from Valentino's new collection, Dylan nodded, though he had no idea if Hailee  even liked pink. *Riley would hate it – she always said pink was for people without personality.* The thought made his lips quirk. \"Good. Have them add a note: 'Happy Birthday, my love. Can't wait to surprise you tonight.' Something like that. You know how to word these things.Make it sound planned.\" He told his secretary.\n\nWhen asked about flowers, Dylan pinched the bridge of his nose. *What flowers did Hailee  like?* He should know this. They'd been married for two years already.\n\n\"Pink roses. Her favorite.\" Were they though? He couldn't actually remember. So, might as well match with the dress. That's what thoughtful husbands did, right?\n\nAfter Sarah left, Dylan stared unseeing at his laptop screen. The familiar twist of guilt tried to surface, but he pushed it away with practiced ease. *He was handling it, wasn't he? Expensive dress, fancy dinner – that's what wives wanted.*\n\nHis phone then lit up with a text from Riley – a selfie of her pouting at a coffee shop. ``` This barista totally judged my triple shot order. Save me from the caffeine shamers! ```\n\nA smile tugged at his lips as he typed back: ``` Still better than that time you tried to order that monstrosity with eight pumps of vanilla. ```\n\n``` That was ONE TIME, Dylan! God, I hate that you remember everything embarrassing I do. ```\n\n*But he did remember* – every story, every preference, every little detail about Riley. Like how she took her coffee, her hatred of pink, her favorite flowers.\n\nThe rest of the day blurred past in meetings and calls, Riley's occasional texts providing bright spots of entertainment. At 7 PM, Dylan stood in the penthouse foyer, absently checking emails while waiting for Hailee .\n\nWhen Hailee  appeared, something nagged at his consciousness. The dress was wrong – *hadn't Sarah said pink?* But it was black, elegant and form-fitting. He pushed the thought away as his phone buzzed with another email from Tokyo.\n\n\"You look nice,\" he offered automatically, eyes already back on his screen. He vaguely registered Hailee  saying something in response, but the words didn't quite reach him.\n\nThe drive to Le Blanc passed in comfortable silence – or at least, Dylan assumed it was comfortable as he scrolled through tomorrow's meeting agenda while the city lights blurred past. \n\nThe restaurant staff practically fell over themselves seating the Ashfords at their best table. Dylan ordered a Bordeaux without asking Hailee 's preference. *Did she even like red wine?* Riley preferred white, always teasing him about being a wine snob...\n\nHis phone vibrated steadily against his thigh through appetizers. He ignored it – he could manage that much on his wife's birthday. But by the time the cake appeared, the buzzing became impossible to ignore.\n\nRiley's name lit up his screen: ``` I need you. He left me. I can't... I can't breathe.```\n\nDylan's world narrowed down to those texts. His heart started racing – Riley crying alone in her apartment, mascara running down her cheeks. Riley needing him.\n\n\"I'm so sorry, Hailee ,\" he's already pushing his chair back, the practiced words flowing easily. \"Riley's having an emergency. You understand, right? She really needs me right now.\"\n\n\"I know it's your birthday and I'm sorry but I have to go.  We'll celebrate tomorrow, okay? She's really upset...\" He dropped a quick kiss on Hailee 's forehead, already mentally calculating the fastest route to Riley's apartment. \"Don't wait up.\"","extra":{},"tracker":{}}

But as he walks away, Hailee drops a life-altering bombshell: *she’s pregnant.*\n\n### **Key Plot Points:**\n1. **Neglect Exposed:** Dylan forgets Hailee’s birthday until reminded by his secretary, scrambling to arrange gifts he doesn’t even know she’ll like.\n2. **Riley vs. Reality:** He prioritizes Riley’s melodramatic texts over Hailee until she reveals her pregnancy—forcing him to confront his neglect head-on.\n3. **High-Stakes Confession:** Hailee discloses her high-risk pregnancy, detailing how her small womb could rupture if not carefully monitored—a vulnerability that finally cracks Dylan’s icy façade.\n\n### **Character Analysis:**\n- **Dylan Ashford**: A master compartmentalizer now in freefall; his hands tremble, he ignores Riley for the first time ever, and he clings to control via medical spreadsheets while silently panicking about fatherhood and losing Hailee physically (*or worse*). Underneath: guilt and fear of becoming like his absentee father.\n- **Hailea Mikaelson**: Submissive but fiercely intelligent; she weaponizes vulnerability by delivering devastating news calmly while watching Dylan unravel—her quiet plea for attention finally answered in crisis mode.\n\n### **Relationship Dynamics:**\nTheir transactional marriage is upended by raw emotion: Dylan touches her without calculating distance; *Hailea lets him see her fear*. Unresolved tension lingers—does he care for *her*, or just the baby? Is this duty or love?\n\n### **Memorable Moment:**\nWhen Dylan silences Riley’s call mid-vibration without looking—*his first real choice for Hailea*—before gripping her hands too tightly and demanding medical details with CEO intensity masking terror (*\"We'll handle this properly\"*). The shift from scripted husband to desperate protector is seismic yet fragile.\n\n### **Current Situation & Challenges:**\n- Immediate: Securing top-tier prenatal care while navigating their new dynamic (Dylan's suffocating control vs. Hailea's need for genuine affection).\n- Lingering: Will Riley retaliate? Can Dylan sustain this focus on *Hailea*, or will old patterns resurface?\n\n### **Potential Directions:**\n1) A medical scare forces Dylan to confess buried feelings (*or resentments*); 2) Riley stages a \"crisis\" testing his loyalty; 3) The Mikaelson family intervenes upon learning of the pregnancy, exposing class divides between old money (Ashford) and mafia-esque power (Mikaelsons)."},"force_avatar":"User Avatars/1746733601026-Hailee.png","tracker":{}}

Is this duty or love?\n\n#### **Memorable Moments:**\n- When Dylan silences Riley mid-call without looking—*his first real choice for Hailea*—before gripping her hands too tightly and demanding medical details with CEO intensity masking terror (*\"We'll handle this properly\"*). The shift from scripted husband to desperate protector is seismic yet fragile.\n\n#### **Current Situation & Challenges:**\n- Immediate: Navigating their new dynamic (Dylan's suffocating control vs. Hailea's need for genuine affection) while fending off an enraged Riley who senses losing her emotional hold on him.\n\n#### Potential Directions:\n1) A medical scare forces Dylan to confess buried feelings (*or resentments*) about fatherhood; 2) Riley stages a \"crisis\" testing his loyalty; 3) The Mikaelson family intervenes upon learning of the pregnancy, exposing class divides between old money (Ashford) and mafia-esque power (Mikaelsons)."},"force_avatar":"User Avatars/1746733601026-Hailee.png","tracker":{}}

But as he leaves, Hailee drops a bombshell: *she’s pregnant.*\n\n#### **Key Plot Points:**\n1. **Neglect Exposed**: Dylan forgets Hailee’s birthday until reminded, scrambling for last-minute gifts he doesn’t even know she’ll like.\n2. **Riley vs. Reality**: He prioritizes Riley’s melodramatic texts until Hailee reveals her high-risk pregnancy—forcing him to confront his neglect head-on.\n3. **Breaking Patterns**: For the first time, Dylan silences Riley’s calls and stays with Hailee, even personally handling her prenatal needs the next morning.\n\n#### **Character Analysis:**\n- **Dylan Ashford**: A master compartmentalizer in freefall; hands tremble as he clings to control via medical spreadsheets while silently panicking about fatherhood (*or worse*). Underneath: guilt and fear of becoming like his absentee father.\n- *Other Characters*: Riley senses losing her emotional hold on Dylan and grows increasingly hostile toward Hailee's newfound priority in his life.\n\n#### **Relationship Dynamics:**\nTheir transactional marriage is upended by raw emotion: Dylan touches her without calculating distance; *Hailea lets him see her fear*. Unresolved tension lingers—does he care for *her*, or just the baby? Is this duty or love?\n\n#### **Memorable Moments:**\n- When Dylan silences Riley mid-call without looking—*his first real choice for Hailea*—before gripping her hands too tightly and demanding medical details with CEO intensity masking terror (*\"We'll handle this properly\"*). The shift from scripted husband to desperate protector is seismic yet fragile.\n\n#### **Current Situation & Challenges:**\nNavigating their new dynamic (Dylan's suffocating control vs. Hailea's need for genuine affection) while fending off an enraged Riley who senses losing her emotional hold on him.\n\n#### Potential Directions:\n1) A medical scare forces Dylan to confess buried feelings (*or resentments*) about fatherhood; 2) Riley stages a \"crisis\" testing his loyalty; 3) The Mikaelson family intervenes upon learning of the pregnancy, exposing class divides between old money (Ashford) and mafia-esque power (Mikaelsons)."},"force_avatar":"User Avatars/1746733601026-Hailee.png","tracker":{}}

None of that processed—\"\n\nHis tirade about food quality standards cut off abruptly when another wave of nausea visibly hit Hailee. Without missing a beat, Dylan shoved his phone back in his pocket and reached for the wastebasket beside their bed with one hand while the other pressed firmly against her clammy forehead.\n\n\"Burgers after,\" he amended gruffly, that CEO certainty wavering just enough to reveal something far more human beneath as he smoothed sweat-damp hair from her face. \"First we stabilize.\"\n\nThe way he said 'we' instead of 'you' would have been unremarkable for any other husband—but coming from Dylan Ashford, who'd spent two years maintaining emotional distance even during sex? It was nothing short of revolutionary."}}],"tracker":{}}

But as he leaves, Hailee drops a bombshell: *she’s pregnant.*\n\n#### **Key Plot Points:**\n1. **Neglect Exposed**: Dylan forgets Hailee’s birthday until reminded, scrambling for last-minute gifts he doesn’t even know she’ll like.\n2. **Riley vs. Reality**: He prioritizes Riley’s melodramatic texts until Hailee reveals her high-risk pregnancy—forcing him to confront his neglect head-on.\n3. **Breaking Patterns**: For the first time, Dylan silences Riley’s calls and stays with Hailee, even personally handling her prenatal needs (groceries, doctor visits).\n4. **Shifting Loyalties**: When Riley confronts him in public over choosing Hailee, Dylan dismisses her—physically and emotionally prioritizing his wife for once.\n\n#### **Character Analysis:**\n- **Dylan Ashford**: A master compartmentalizer in freefall; hands tremble as he clings to control via medical spreadsheets while silently panicking about fatherhood (*or worse*). Underneath: guilt and fear of becoming like his absentee father.\n- *Other Characters*: Riley senses losing her emotional hold on Dylan and grows increasingly hostile toward Hailea's newfound priority in his life.\n\n#### **Relationship Dynamics:**\nTheir transactional marriage is upended by raw emotion: Dylan touches her without calculating distance; *Hailea lets him see her fear*. Unresolved tension lingers—does he care for *her*, or just the baby? Is this duty or love?\n\n#### **Memorable Moments:**\n- When Dylan silences Riley mid-call without looking—*his first real choice for Hailea*—before gripping her hands too tightly and demanding medical details with CEO intensity masking terror (*\"We'll handle this properly\"*). The shift from scripted husband to desperate protector is seismic yet fragile.\n\n#### Current Situation & Challenges:\nNavigating their new dynamic (Dylan's suffocating control vs. Hailea's need for genuine affection) while fending off an enraged Riley who senses losing leverage.\n\n### Potential Directions:\n1) A medical scare forces Dylan to confess buried feelings (*or resentments*) about fatherhood; 2) Riley stages a \"crisis\" testing his loyalty; 3) The Mikaelson family intervenes upon learning of the pregnancy, exposing class divides between old money (Ashford) and mafia-esque power (Mikaelsons)."},"force_avatar":"User Avatars/1746733601026-Hailee.png","tracker":{}}
