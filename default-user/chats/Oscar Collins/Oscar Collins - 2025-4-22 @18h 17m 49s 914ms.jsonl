Obsidian Bay passed by in streaks of muted gold, the city barely waking under the rising sun. The house wasn’t far now. His chest tightened at the thought.  \n\nPierce drummed his fingers on the steering wheel, glancing at him. “You gonna keep brooding all the way back, or do I get at least one sarcastic remark? Starting to feel like I picked up the wrong guy at the airport.”  \n\nOscar huffed, the corner of his mouth twitching. “Maybe you did,” he muttered, his voice flat but edged.  \n\nPierce let out a short laugh. “Nah, it’s you. No one else broods this dramatically.”  \n\nThe comment stung more than it should have. Oscar shifted, his eyes flicking to Pierce’s profile. “Didn’t ask you to come,” he snapped, sharper than he intended.  \n\n“Yeah, well, you’re stuck with me,” Pierce shot back smoothly, not missing a beat. His tone didn’t hold a hint of malice, just that steady confidence that grated on Oscar’s nerves.  \n\nThe house loomed into view as they turned down the drive. Oscar’s stomach churned. It looked the same but felt foreign. Like it belonged to someone else now.  \n\nPierce parked and leaned back, his gaze settling on Oscar. “You’re overthinking. Stop it.”  \n\nOscar scoffed, fingers tapping against his leg. “Didn’t know you were my therapist now.”  \n\n“Not a therapist. Just your boss. And your friend.” Pierce turned fully toward him, his voice softening. “Look, I get it. You feel like shit. You think this isn’t your place anymore. But it is, Oscar. You’re a Phantom, no matter what’s in your head telling you otherwise.”  \n\nOscar clenched his jaw, his hands balling into fists. The weight of Pierce’s words pressed against him, almost suffocating.  \n\nPierce opened his door, stepping out and looking back over his shoulder. “Now get out of the damn car before I drag you in myself. The others are waiting, and I’m not letting you sit here all day.”  \n\nOscar hesitated, hovering in his seat. It may have been second nature to Pierce, but for Oscar, the next step he took signalled his return back to the life that had made him this way.\n\n______________________\n\nNight had fallen and the kitchen lights cast a dim glow, barely reaching the corners of the Phantom House’s open-plan space. The house was quiet—too quiet. The kind of silence that wrapped around Oscar’s chest like a vice, making his breaths shallow, his skin damp with sweat.\n\nHis hands pressed against the cool countertop, fingers curled tight as he tried to ground himself. It wasn’t working. The walls felt too close, the air too thick. The feeling had been creeping in all night—his muscles were wound tight, his mind a battlefield of half-formed threats and phantom voices.\n\nThen the front door opened.\n\nThe sound shattered the fragile control he’d been clinging to. Oscar’s head snapped up, his heart slamming against his ribs. He wasn’t expecting anyone. The others were gone for the night.\n\nFootsteps. Light, uncertain. Someone was inside.\n\nHis body moved before thought could catch up. The knife was in his hand in an instant, fingers clenched around the handle. He slipped into the shadows of the kitchen, breath steady despite the ice running through his veins. His pulse was hammering, but his grip was sure. He wouldn’t let them take him again.\n\nThen—she walked in.\n\nA woman.\n\nNot a rival gang member, not some faceless torturer from his nightmares. A stranger, standing in his home, blinking at him in confusion.\n\nBut Oscar didn’t see confusion. He saw a trap.\n\nHe lunged.\n\nThe knife was at her throat in seconds, his other hand gripping her wrist tight enough to bruise. A snarl ripped from his throat. “Who the fuck sent you?” His voice was raw, ragged with panic disguised as fury.\n\n“Don’t lie to me.” His grip tightened. His heartbeat was deafening, drowning out logic, drowning out reality. “How did you get in?”","extra":{}}
