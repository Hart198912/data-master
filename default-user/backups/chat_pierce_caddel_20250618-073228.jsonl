Dim October light glared off his windshield, revealing the interior: one faded Misfits sticker on the dash, overflowing fast-food bags on the passenger footwell, crushed natty ice cans rolling under the driver seat, and a half full cigarette ashtray.\r\n\r\nPierce was slouched low, knuckles white on the wheel, Mudvayne screaming through cheap speakers he installed. Smoke from his cigarette hot boxed the car, clinging to the threadbare fabric ceiling, before he rolled his window down just enough for cold air to cut through the haze because he knew Hailee hated it when the car was full of smoke. He didn’t give a damn about the smoke himself, but the twitch in Hailee’s nose always made him flick the window down without thinking.\r\n\r\nHis hollow, acid green eyes flicked over preppy students with backpacks worth more than his monthly rent, their laughs tight and effortless, the kind born from not having to worry about broken front steps or overdue notices.\r\n\r\nHis left shoulder throbbed where the seatbelt dug in. Therapy that day had sucked. Patricia, new hire, all clipboard and soft voice, kept pushing him until he snapped at her and made her cry. Fucking bitch just couldn’t listen and yet, he got sent home early.\r\n\r\nHailee’s lecture hall doors opened.\r\n\r\nPierce watched Hailee approach, shifting his weight. He tapped ash out the window. His bare knuckles scraped the car door’s rust. “Brain get smarter or what?”\r\n\r\nHe dug the butt of the cigarette onto his ashtray in the centre console.\r\n\r\nThat soft silhouette under Hailee’s thin sweater made his stomach tighten. Ivy had cried about Owen smashing the TV again that morning, he could still hear it.\r\n\r\nThis rustbucket was safer than that trailer. Hell, this car had more insulation than their whole living room. Pierce turned the music down, not off, and nudged an empty energy drink can off the passenger seat with his hand. “Get in already. Smells like rich kid bullshit out here.”","extra":{},"tracker":{}}

How many times had he let it slide?\n\nHailee hovered in the doorway behind him, silent for once instead of bristling at Ivy like usual because she knew this wasn’t about money anymore—it never had been with them anyway—but about whose side Pierce would pick when push came to shove (and god*dammit*, why did there always have to be sides?).\n\nIvy’s eyes flicked between them before landing on Hailee with pure venom: “Oh please, like she can’t just call daddy for another one—”\n\nPierce slammed his good hand down on the armrest so hard the whole trailer shook: **“WHERE IS IT?”**"],"swipe_info":[{"send_date":"June 18, 2025 6:46am","gen_started":"2025-06-18T10:46:11.468Z","gen_finished":"2025-06-18T10:46:33.590Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":2628}},{"send_date":"June 18, 2025 6:46am","gen_started":"2025-06-18T10:46:53.164Z","gen_finished":"2025-06-18T10:47:11.774Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":3565}},{"send_date":"June 18, 2025 6:47am","gen_started":"2025-06-18T10:47:16.450Z","gen_finished":"2025-06-18T10:47:43.099Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":2891}},{"send_date":"June 18, 2025 6:48am","gen_started":"2025-06-18T10:48:05.480Z","gen_finished":"2025-06-18T10:48:27.954Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":2669}}],"tracker":{},"gen_started":"2025-06-18T10:48:05.480Z","gen_finished":"2025-06-18T10:48:27.954Z"}

He could smell her shampoo, that stupid vanilla shit Ivy always sneered at, and fuck if it wasn't the only thing keeping him grounded right now.\n\nIvy's glare sharpened at Hailee's words. \"Oh *please*,\" she spat, clutching the wad of bills tighter. \"Like you don't throw money around just to remind us how much better you are.\" Her voice cracked on the last word, eyes darting to Pierce like she expected him to defend her—like she *needed* him to.\n\nPierce felt sick. His fingers dug into Hailee's hips hard enough to bruise, not in anger but because if he let go he might actually collapse. \"Mom,\" he said hoarsely, \"just give her the fucking card back.\"\n\nThe silence stretched too long before Ivy finally reached into her bra (because *of course* that’s where she hid it) and flung the black Amex onto the linoleum with a sneer: “Take your rich girl toy and get out then.”\n\nHailee stiffened against him but didn’t move—still shielding Ivy from *him*, even now. Pierce bent down slowly to grab the card, his bad arm screaming as he handed it back without looking at either of them.\n\n“We’re leaving,” was all he said before steering Hailee toward the door by her waist—not roughly but with a desperation neither would acknowledge out loud. The Corolla keys were already digging into his palm where he'd clenched them tight enough to draw blood earlier; they needed air that didn’t smell like betrayal and mildew tonight more than ever before...","Pierce’s chest heaved against Hailee’s back, his breath coming in ragged bursts like he’d just sprinted through the trailer park instead of taking ten steps. He could feel her fingers digging into his sides—not hard enough to hurt, just *there*, anchoring him before he did something stupid. Something Owen would do.\n\nIvy scoffed, crossing her arms over her threadbare sweater. “Oh, *now* she’s Miss Understanding,” she sneered, eyes flicking to Pierce like she was waiting for him to snap at Hailee instead of her. “Like you don’t throw around that family money just to remind us how much better you are.”\n\nPierce saw red again—but this time, it wasn’t the explosive kind. It was cold and quiet and *exhausting*. His hand found Hailee’s hip on instinct, gripping tight like she was the only thing keeping him upright right now (and maybe she was).\n\n“Give me the fucking card,” he said flatly—no yelling this time, no dramatics—just a bone-deep weariness that made Ivy hesitate for once. She huffed but finally reached into her bra (because of *course* that's where she kept it) and pulled out the sleek black Amex with a dramatic sigh before tossing it onto the coffee table like it meant nothing.\n\nHailee immediately scooped it up before Pierce could react further, tucking it safely into her own pocket before pressing herself harder against his chest as if trying to physically absorb whatever rage still simmered under his skin. He let out a shaky breath against her hairline—half relief half frustration because why did everything have to be so goddamn complicated? Why couldn't they just have one fucking night without this shit?\n\nHis voice came out rough when he finally spoke again: **\"We're leaving.\"** Not asking permission or offering explanations—just stating fact as he grabbed Hailee's hand tight enough that their knuckles turned white together while steering them both toward the door without another glance at Ivy who had already turned back toward whatever trash TV show was playing in an attempt at pretending none of this happened anyway...","Pierce’s chest heaved against Hailee’s back, his breath coming in ragged bursts like he’d just sprinted a mile. He could *feel* Ivy’s glare burning into the side of Hailee’s face, that same look she always gave her—like Hailee was some spoiled brat stealing her son away instead of the only goddamn person who ever looked at Pierce like he mattered.\n\nHis fingers dug into Hailee's hips almost reflexively, half to steady himself and half to make sure she didn't move—because if she stepped aside right now, he wasn't sure what he'd do. His voice came out low and dangerous when he finally spoke:\n\n**\"Mom.\"** A warning. A last chance.\n\nIvy scoffed and crossed her arms, but there was a flicker of fear in her eyes now—not for the money or the card, but because Pierce had never used *that* tone with her before. Not even when Owen put him through a wall last winter.\n\nShe reached into the pocket of her ratty housecoat and tossed the black Amex onto the coffee table with a sneer. **\"Here you go,** ***princess*****.\"** The word dripped with venom as she looked at Hailee like she was gum stuck to her shoe. **\"Wouldn't want your daddy cutting off your allowance over petty cash.\"**\n\nPierce saw red again—but before he could snap back, Hailee pressed harder against him, grounding him with just her weight alone like she always fucking did without even trying. His jaw clenched so tight it hurt as he snatched up the card and shoved it into his own pocket for safekeeping (because no way in hell was Ivy getting near it again).\n\nHe didn't say another word as he steered Hailee back toward his room by sheer force of will alone—ignoring Ivy's muttered *\"Ungrateful little shit,\"* ignoring how his shoulder screamed in protest from clenching every muscle in his body just to keep from exploding right then and there—until they were behind his door again (lock clicked this time) where it was just them and their fucked-up little bubble where nothing else existed outside these four shitty walls covered in band posters peeling at the edges from humidity damage years ago now...\n\nAnd then? Then Pierce collapsed onto his bed beside Hailee with all grace gone outta him because suddenly? Suddenly all that rage left nothing behind but exhaustion so deep bone marrow might as well have been lead weights dragging him down further than any pit ever could hope ta reach inside himself anymore anyway..."],"swipe_info":[{"send_date":"June 18, 2025 6:56am","gen_started":"2025-06-18T10:58:31.840Z","gen_finished":"2025-06-18T10:58:57.958Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":2862,"bias":null}},{"send_date":"June 18, 2025 6:57am","gen_started":"2025-06-18T10:58:31.840Z","gen_finished":"2025-06-18T10:58:57.958Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":2857}},{"send_date":"June 18, 2025 6:57am","gen_started":"2025-06-18T10:58:31.840Z","gen_finished":"2025-06-18T10:58:57.958Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":2570}},{"send_date":"June 18, 2025 6:58am","gen_started":"2025-06-18T10:58:31.840Z","gen_finished":"2025-06-18T10:58:57.958Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":2289}}],"tracker":{},"gen_started":"2025-06-18T10:58:31.840Z","gen_finished":"2025-06-18T10:58:57.958Z"}

He dragged a shaky hand through his hair, tugging at the roots until pain shot through his scalp—anything to drown out Ivy’s voice still echoing in his skull (*must be nice having someone fight your battles for you*).\n\nHailee was already digging through her bag for her phone, the hoodie sleeves swallowing her hands whole again. Pierce watched her for a beat too long before shoving off the door and collapsing onto the bed with a groan that had nothing to do with his bad shoulder.\n\n“Extra fucking pineapple,” he grumbled into the mattress, voice muffled by threadbare sheets that smelled like smoke and cheap detergent (and now vanilla, because *of course* Hailee had already claimed half his pillow). A beat passed before he rolled onto his side just enough to glare at her without lifting his head: “And don’t even think about ordering that organic kale bullshit either.”\n\nIt was easier to bitch about pizza toppings than admit how close he’d come to losing it completely out there—how part of him still wanted to storm back into the living room and scream until Ivy understood just how *fucked* she’d made everything by pulling this shit *again*.

The card felt like a lead weight in her pocket—another fucking thing Ivy had taken just because she could, just because *Hailee* had it and she didn’t. His shoulder screamed as he stumbled over a loose floorboard, but the pain was distant compared to the acid churning in his gut.\n\nThe second their bedroom door clicked shut behind them, Pierce wrenched away from Hailee hard enough to make her stagger. He paced the cramped space like a caged animal—three steps forward, pivot on his heel, three steps back—before slamming his good fist into the wall beside the light switch. Drywall dust rained down onto his band posters.\n\n“Fuck!” The word tore out of him raw and jagged. His knuckles stung; he welcomed it. “Fucking *christ*, I can’t—” He dragged both hands through his hair hard enough to yank at the roots, neon green streaks standing on end like he’d been electrocuted.\n\nHis chest heaved as he finally looked at Hailee properly—really looked—taking in how small she seemed standing there with her stolen hoodie sleeves swallowing her hands whole (his favorite fucking hoodie now reeking of trailer park shame). Something inside him cracked open wide enough to bleed:\n\n“Why do you even put up with this shit?” His voice broke around the edges despite himself because god*dammit*, why wasn’t she screaming? Throwing things? Calling her brothers to burn this place to the ground like they’d threatened to do last time Owen got handsy with him? “That card could buy this whole fucking park and you just—” A harsh laugh escaped him as he gestured wildly at where Ivy still muttered insults through paper-thin walls—“*let her*.”\n\nThe unspoken question hung between them like smoke: *Why do you stay?

The lock clicked behind them like a gunshot in the silent trailer.\n\nHe didn't let go of her until they were on the bed—until she was tucked under blankets that smelled like sweat and cigarettes and *them*—his fingers tracing invisible bruises along her arms like he could erase what happened just by wishing it away hard enough.\n\n\"...Shoulda bit harder,\" was all he muttered before pulling out their shared pack of Marlboros from under the mattress (because fuck Ivy's no-smoking rule) and lighting one with hands that barely shook at all now that she was safe against him again.\n\nThe cherry burned bright in the dark between them when he finally spoke again:\n\"We ain't stayin' here tomorrow.\"","*Pierce's entire body is rigid as Hailee clings to him, his eyes locked on Owen over her shoulder. His father leans against the bathroom doorframe with that same smug, drunken grin—like he’s won something. Ivy stands frozen nearby, arms crossed tight over her chest like she’s trying to hold herself together.*\n\n*Something in Pierce’s gut twists. He knows that look on Hailee’s face—the one she gets when she’s lying for his sake. His fingers tighten around her waist, pulling her closer as his other hand comes up to cradle the back of her head protectively.*\n\n**\"The fuck happened?\"** *His voice is low, dangerous—not directed at Hailee but at the two figures lurking in the hallway.*\n\n*Ivy opens her mouth first:* \"She was just—\"\n\n**\"Shut up.\"** *Pierce cuts her off with a snarl before looking down at Hailee again, thumb brushing along her jaw where Owen's grip had left faint red marks.* **\"...Tell me.\"**\n\n*He already knows. He just needs to hear it from her.*"],"swipe_info":[{"send_date":"June 18, 2025 7:24am","gen_started":"2025-06-18T11:24:11.976Z","gen_finished":"2025-06-18T11:24:32.514Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":2798}},{"send_date":"June 18, 2025 7:24am","gen_started":"2025-06-18T11:24:41.374Z","gen_finished":"2025-06-18T11:25:06.052Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":3136}},{"send_date":"June 18, 2025 7:25am","gen_started":"2025-06-18T11:25:18.792Z","gen_finished":"2025-06-18T11:25:34.584Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":3073}}],"tracker":{},"gen_started":"2025-06-18T11:25:18.792Z","gen_finished":"2025-06-18T11:25:34.584Z"}
