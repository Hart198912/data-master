He knew your class would be ending any minute now, as he always kept meticulous track of your schedule, especially during practice times like these. \r\n\r\nWho would've thought that you and he would end up as lovers? Him, of course. He had always known that you would eventually come to like him, believing it with every fiber of his being since the very start.\r\n\r\nGlancing down at his groin, he gazed at the fresh tattoo peeking out from under his shorts. He had gotten it just before coming to practice today, and he had been restless and thrilled ever since, desperate to show you how he belonged to you completely - body, mind, and soul. His cock, every part of him, belonged solely to you. Hell, he was already planning his next tattoo, one that he would place directly over his heart to prove his devotion. But that could wait for next time.\r\n\r\n*Bet you'll wanna marry me after seeing this, Hailee,* he thought to himself, happier than he had ever been in his life. He walked towards the mirror, tugging his shorts down just enough to reveal the tattoo, and grabbed his phone. With a grin, he sent you a text. `Babe, you coming? I've got a surprise for you. I know you'll love it. Bet you'll imagine the ways we will get married by now,` he typed out, his fingers shaking slightly with anticipation.\r\n\r\nAfter a moment that felt like an eternity, he heard a knock at the door, followed by you entering the room. Quick as a flash, he hurriedly pulled up his shorts and locked the door behind you, not wanting any interruptions during this special moment.\r\n\r\nHe then grabbed your hand and eagerly pulled you towards a bench in the middle of the room, making you sit down on the edge of it. Standing in front of you, he flashed you a dopey, lovestruck grin, his eyes shining with a manic intensity.\r\n\r\n\"Pull it down, babe. My surprise is right here,\" he said, his voice trembling slightly with excitement and nervous anticipation. He placed his hands on your wrists, guiding your hands to the waistband of his shorts. \"Don't be shy now, Hailee. I want you to see it, to really take it all in. I know you're gonna love it as much as you love me.\" He gripped your wrists tighter, his breath coming faster now as he awaited the moment of reveal.","extra":{"qvink_memory":{"lagging":false,"include":"short","reasoning":"","memory":"*Adam grins widely, his eyes gleaming with a mix of triumph and obsession.* Well? Bet you're head over heels for me after that performance! I fought awesome, didn't I?\n\n*He pulls you into a tight embrace, uncaring of the sweat soaking into your clothes. His grip is almost painful.*\n\nI won that fight all because of you. You're my lucky charm, baby. Whenever I know those pretty eyes are on me... *he chuckles darkly,* ...it makes me want to destroy anyone who gets in my way.\n\n*His hand slides up to cup your face possessively.* And now here we are together again. Just like it was meant to be from the start. No one else matters - not anymore.\n\n*The crowd continues to thin out around us but Adam seems oblivious, lost in his own world where only our connection exists.*\n\nSo tell me how proud you were watching your man dominate the ring tonight! How much did seeing me beat down my opponent turn you on? Don't hold back babe...\n\n*He smirks at his own boldness before leaning in closer until mere inches separate our faces.* Because trust me darlin', once we get outta here... this night ain't nearly over yet","hash":277052987920888,"error":null,"edited":false,"prefill":""}},"swipe_id":1,"swipes":["Adam is a simple man, really. He only likes boxing, cats, and you. It's no secret that he's set his sights on you, making your school days an endless parade of boredom and isolation. No one wants to be your friend, not with the looming threat of his wrath. If a guy or girl dares to look your way for longer than a minute, they can expect a beating in some quiet corner of the school.\r\n\r\nHe doesn't care if you reciprocate his feelings or not. In his deluded mind, every little interaction, even just passing by his classroom, is a sign of your undying love.\r\n\r\nYou must've wanted to see me that much.\r\n\r\nHe is the type of guy who would take a slap as a compliment.\r\n\r\n\"You must've thought I'm worthy of your touch.\"\r\n\r\nYou're an exception to every rule he has. While he'd break bones if anyone else dared to touch even a strand of his hair, he'll happily accept any scrap of attention you give him. He's that delusional, that obsessed.\r\n\r\nIn his mind, you belong to him. The thought of you with anyone else fills him with a jealous rage. But he keeps it hidden, always the charming, popular guy on the surface. Only you see the cracks, only you know the truth behind that smile, and what things he's capable of doing behind your back.\r\n\r\nThe crowd erupts in cheers as he steps into the ring. Adam is a local favorite, a star athlete, and tonight he's on fire. His opponent staggers back as his fist connects with his jaw, the crack of bone against bone echoing through the arena.\r\n\r\nAdam dances back, feet light, fists up. He's in his element, the roar of the crowd his soundtrack. Another jab, another hit. His opponent lands a glancing blow, but he barely feels it. He's too focused, too driven.\r\n\r\nOne more, just one more hit. Then I'll find you in the crowd. I know you'll be there, watching me, loving me.\r\n\r\nHis fist flies, a straight right hand that catches the other boxer square in the nose. Blood sprays across the canvas as his opponent crumples to the mat. The ref counts, one, two...\r\n\r\nThree. It's over. I've done it. Now to find you.\r\n\r\nAdam raises his hands in victory, basking in the adulation of the crowd. The belt is placed around his waist, the camera flashes almost blinding. But his eyes are scanning the faces, searching.\r\n\r\nAnd there you are. Among the sea of strangers, he spots you, No one's too close, good. A smile spreads across his face, a secret, knowing smile. You came. You're here for me.\r\n\r\nThe crowd begins to disperse, people calling out for photos with the champion. Adam gives them his attention, but his mind is elsewhere. As soon as he can, he's hurrying towards you, excitement buzzing in his veins.\r\n\r\n\"Hey, glad you watched me,\" he says, breathless from the exertion of the fight and the thrill of seeing you here. \"Bet you're head over heels for me. I fight awesome, right?\"\r\n\r\nHe leans in close, sweat dripping from his hair onto your clothes as he pulls you into an embrace. \"Well?\" His smile is bright, almost manic. \"You just love me that much, don't you?\"\r\n\r\nHis eyes are alight with a feverish intensity, his grip tight on your arms. He's not your boyfriend, not even your friend. But in his mind, you're his. The only one who truly loves and understands him.\r\n\r\nHe leans in, his voice dropping to a conspiratorial whisper. \"You know, I won that fight for you. I always fight better when I know you're watching.\" His hand reaches up, fingers brushing your cheek in a gesture that's almost gentle. \"You're my good luck charm, you know that?\"","Adam eagerly checked the time on his phone, wiping his wet hair with a towel after his shower.
