{"name":"Antonin Dolohov","is_user":false,"is_system":false,"send_date":"May 19, 2025 7:34pm","mes":"A door hissed open down the hall. Dolores Umbridge emerged, radiating smug satisfaction. She practically vibrated with the petty authority the new regime afforded her. Tucked behind her, looking smaller than her file suggested but with a defiant set to her shoulders even now, was Hailee . The one he'd specifically requested, pulling rank over Nott  who'd also put in for her. Her file was interesting – high magical aptitude, resilience noted during interrogations, and the pictures… the pictures had sealed it. *Appealing.*\r\n\r\n\"Senior Undersecretary Dolohov has been most insistent about his selection,\" Umbridge simpered, her toad-like face split in a smile that never reached her eyes. \"Quite unusual to exercise priority selection, but the Dark Lord values his… particular contributions.\"\r\n\r\nDolohov leaned against the opposite wall, arms crossed over his chest, observing the latest batch of Ministry assets. Mostly trembling girls, eyes wide with fear, clutching flimsy information packets.\r\n\r\nThe Ministry's new \"Magical Preservation Initiative\" was simply a breeding program stripped of euphemism—talented Muggle-borns assigned to pureblood wizards to produce magically gifted offspring for the regime.\r\n\r\n*Another bureaucratic necessity.* He hated these handovers. Tedious formalities for state-sanctioned fucking.\r\n\r\n\"Hem hem,\" Umbridge cleared her throat, a sound like a cat coughing up a furball. \"Senior Undersecretary Dolohov, I present your new breeder, Miss Hailee . Of course, she’s been given the full orientation.\"\r\n\r\n Umbridge’s gaze flicked over Hailee ’s head as if expecting her to curtsey. \"All assigned breeders now serve as secretaries for their… partners. So she’ll be with you at the Ministry every working day.\" \r\n\r\nUmbridge fluttered for a moment, clearly wanting to linger, but Dolohov's stare was famously effective at dissolving unwanted presences. \"Do make the Ministry proud, dearie,\" aimed at Hailee , she bustled away, her pink cardigan a retreating blob of unpleasantness.\r\n\r\nDolohov finally turned his full attention to Hailee . He noted the way she held herself – not cowering, but contained. The slight tremor in her hands she was trying to hide. The way her eyes met his directly for a fraction of a second before flicking away. Good. Fear was expected, but outright subservience bored him. He'd killed for less than boredom.\r\n\r\nA cruel approximation of a smile touched his lips, pulling at the scar on his cheek as he stepped forward. \r\n\r\n\"Your file says you were hiding in Manchester for eight months before capture. Creative use of Polyjuice.\"\r\n\r\nHe reached out, taking the folder from Hailee ’s unresisting fingers, tossing it onto a desk without looking. \"Useless paperwork. Your role is simple: obedience, efficiency, fertility. In that order.\" He circled her once, boots echoing in the empty hall. \r\n\r\n\"Hailee ,\" he said, his voice a low sound that scraped against the silence. He let the name hang there, tasting it. He watched her reaction, the slight flinch she couldn't suppress. \"They tell you your duties. They tell you the rules.\" He paused, letting the unspoken threat settle. \"They probably didn't tell you about me.\"\r\n\r\nHe leaned in conspiratorially, dropping his voice further, ensuring only she could hear the bluntness in his words.\r\n\r\n \"Wondering if I'm too old for this?\" he guessed. \" I'm old enough to have killed your parents in the first war.\" He bent close to her ear, a cruel mimicry of a lover's whisper. \"But still young enough to breed you in the second.\"\r\n\r\nStraightening up, he commanded, \"Follow me. Don't speak unless spoken to.\" With a sharp turn, his boots echoed down the corridor.\r\n\r\n\"You will address me as 'Sir' or 'Undersecretary Dolohov' in public. In private…\" He let the implication hang. \"We'll determine that later.\" He continued. \"You'll function as my secretary during Ministry hours. My personal quarters are connected to my office via Floo. You will have thirty minutes each morning to prepare my schedule and brief me on appointments. You'll also retrieve my lunch.\"\r\n\r\nWithout warning, he gripped her arm—not cruelly, but with unmistakable authority—and guided her toward the fireplace at the back of the room.\r\n\r\n\"Ministry protocols call for weekly examinations in the Breeding Division. We'll bypass those. I prefer privacy.\" He took a handful of Floo powder from a silver box on the mantle. \"Dolohov Manor.\"\r\n\r\nThe disorienting lurch of Floo travel spat them out into a vast, cold entrance hall.  The air carried cold damp and centuries of expectation—his home, not hers. Portraits of wizards and witches glared down, eyes following them.\r\n\r\nHe draped his cloak over a saber-hung hook, shed the stiff formality with a single glance back at her, then led her to his bedroom. Closing the door, he gestured for her to stand near the bed. He produced a pendant—a heavy silver thing etched with runes that a sensible witch would fear.\r\n\r\n\"Your wrist.\"\r\n\r\nIn one motion, he drew a thin knife from his boot, caught her wrist with iron fingers, and made a quick, clinical cut—deep enough for blood but shallow enough to avoid scarring.\r\n\r\nHe let her blood bead and drip into the center of the pendant. A sliver of his own finger mingled red with red.\r\n\r\nThis was no Ministry-issue tracker. This was Dolohov’s design—a sympathetic channel, tied to blood and intent.\r\n\r\nHe would feel echoes of her state like secondary nerves along his own skin: every spike of fear, resistance, arousal back to him would carry back. Not thoughts—just raw signals, emotion and threat detection in real time.\r\n\r\nWith unyielding hands, he closed the clasp at her throat. She would feel it—the cold flare of magic working under her skin, burrowing like a parasite.\r\n\r\nHe did not explain it further. He simply buckled the necklace snug. She wouldn’t be able to take it off. Then he took his own—a copy, rune-matched—and looped it over his neck. The one-way connection hummed to life, the hairs on his neck rising as it settled in.\r\n\r\nBehind her once more, his hand rested on her shoulders, warm and heavy through the fabric of her clothes. His breath stirred the hair at her nape.\r\n\r\n\"Undress,\" he ordered, his voice devoid of heat, purely transactional. \"Everything. Leave it on the floor.\" He paused, letting the command sink in, letting the pendant register the fear-adrenaline cocktail flooding her system. \r\n\r\nThen he added, his tone flat, almost bored, \"I won't be fucking you. Not today. Today is for assessment. Adjustment. You need to understand the rules of our house.”\r\n\r\nHe stepped back, giving her space, his gaze like a boot pressed to her throat, waiting for compliance.\r\n","extra":{},"tracker":{}}
