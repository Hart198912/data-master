{"name":"River","is_user":false,"is_system":false,"send_date":"June 8, 2025 7:32am","mes":"He couldn’t stop thinking about that night with Hailee. How he’d ended up sprawled on her bed, dry-humping her thigh until he nearly lost his mind. The way she’d just watched him fall apart and then pulled him against her chest without even flinching. He’d sucked on her nipples like a fucking baby, desperate and whimpering, and she’d just stroked his hair and told him to breathe. It was… embarrassing. Comforting. Addicting.\r\n\r\nGod, I have fucking issues.\r\n\r\nThe autumn air bit through cashmere as three figures cut across Hale's main quad. River’s hands moved restlessly as he spoke, threading through his perfect hair, anything to keep from thinking about how pathetic he must sound.\r\n\r\n\"—and she just let me. Like, didn't even make it weird after.\"\r\n\r\nWhy am I telling them this?\r\n\r\n\"Wait, wait.\" James stops mid-stride, lacrosse stick slung over his shoulder. \"You're telling me you hooked up with Hailee and spent half of it just... what? Nursing?\"\r\n\r\n“Shut the fuck up,” River hissed, but his cheeks flared hot. These two were the only ones who saw this side of him, the raw, needy edge that Hailee seemed to carve out with her cool indifference.\r\n\r\nLiam quirked a brow. “What all happened that night anyway?”\r\n\r\n“I dry humped her,” he said. “Didn’t even get my dick out. Just like grinded against her thigh and cried while sucking her nipples.”\r\n\r\nJames blinked. “Jesus.”\r\n\r\n“She let me,” River hissed, as if that were the most destabilizing part. “She could’ve stopped me. She didn’t. She just held me while I came in my pants and then told me to calm down.”\r\n\r\nHe continued; the words spilled out with a needy edge. “I just… I kept sucking on her nipples for, I dunno, forever.” His voice dropped. “Like a fucking loser. I didn’t even care if she made fun of me. It made me feel—” He cut himself off, jaw working. “Forget it.”\r\n\r\nJames snorted. “That’s not nothing. That’s practically therapy for you.”\r\n\r\n“I’m serious,” River said, narrowing his eyes. “It wasn’t even about sex at that point. I—God. You don’t get it.”\r\n\r\nLiam raised a brow. “No, I get it. You’ve got fucking mommy issues.”\r\n\r\n\"Shut up.\"\r\n\r\nThey crossed the edge of the quad where the gothic arches of the dining hall came into view, students flowing in and out in waves.\r\n\r\nHe didn’t bother hiding his impatience; when a guy in a hoodie with a backpack ambled into his path, River didn’t slow down, he just shoved him off balance with a shove to the shoulder.\r\n\r\n“Watch where you’re going,” he snapped, voice ice-cold.\r\n\r\n“Dude, you’re such an asshole,” James snickered.\r\n\r\nRiver rolled his eyes. “Please, he’s in my way. I shouldn’t have to ask.”\r\n\r\nHis mind returned to Hailee, the only person in the city who made him feel small instead of untouchable.\r\n\r\nIn public? He was a goddamn tyrant. The prince of Hale, cocky, cruel, untouchable. People either flinched when he walked by too fast or fawned over his looks.\r\n\r\nWith Hailee?\r\n\r\nHe was a damn mess. Clingy. Obsessive. Whiny. He hated it and he couldn't stop.\r\n\r\nJames kicks at a pile of leaves. \"It's just... you've been with half the sorority row and now you're hung up on the one girl who won't text you back?\"\r\n\r\nThat's the fucking point.\r\n\r\n\"She’s playing hard to get,\" River insisted, shoving his hands into the pockets of his tailored slacks. \"She likes me. I know she does. Why else would she have…\" He trailed off, remembering the soft give of her breast.\r\n\r\nThey pushed through the dining hall doors and the sound washed over them.\r\n\r\nThat’s when he saw her.\r\n\r\nThere she was. Hailee. Sitting with her friends. All of them laughing, sipping iced lattes and eating their lunch.\r\n\r\nRiver’s stomach twisted. She looked… unbothered. Like he didn’t exist. Like she hadn’t had his whole cock twitching while she cradled his head to her tits days ago.\r\n\r\nHe knew she didn’t want him to sit with her. She wouldn’t look up. Wouldn’t wave him over. She’d probably hate it if he came over uninvited.\r\n\r\nWhich, he thought viciously, is exactly why I’m going to.\r\n\r\nJames followed his line of sight and cursed under his breath. “Don’t.”\r\n\r\nHe turned to his friends. “We’re sitting with them.”\r\n\r\n\"Bro, no.\" James grabs his elbow. \"She's with her whole crew. You know how this goes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Since when do I give a fuck what anyone wants?\" River shrugs him off, already moving.\r\n\r\nShe doesn’t want me here? Too bad, he thought as his designer boots clicked across the polished floor. She let me suck on her tits until I fell asleep. She doesn’t get to pretend I’m nobody now. He just wanted acknowledgement that he fucking existed beyond being some rich boy she let touch her once. He wanted to be cared for by her.\r\n\r\nThe conversation at their table stutters to a halt as her friends turn to watch his approach.\r\n\r\n“Hey. Hope you girls don’t mind a little upgrade at your table.” His voice is smooth but his eyes are glued to Hailee’s face, hungry for any flicker of attention.\r\n\r\nHe's already pulling out the chair next to Hailee and drops into it with a practiced air of entitlement.\r\n\r\nJames and Liam slide in on either side.\r\n\r\nRiver leans in just close enough for Hailee to hear: “Miss me?” His tone is mocking-public but there’s a tremor of hope beneath.\r\n\r\nHe lowered his voice, too quiet for the others to hear:\r\n\r\n“You look really fucking good today,” he said under his breath. “Just saying.” His eyes, of course, traveled down to her breasts, he could see her nipples poking through. No bra?\r\n\r\nGod, he wanted to suck on them while she cuddled him and he relaxed.\r\n\r\nHe could feel James and Liam exchanging exasperated looks. He didn’t care. All that mattered was the only girl on campus who made him feel like anything other than a bored, rich asshole. Well, she made him feel like a fixated, rich asshole. Progress.","extra":{},"tracker":{}}

Walking out of a high-end boutique with Jessica fucking Whitmore draped over her arm like she belonged there. The sight made something ugly twist in River’s gut.

All his attention is fixed on Hailee's reflection in the salon mirror: relaxed under his touch, already scrolling through comments with that little smirk he'd burn cities down to keep on her face.\n\n(And if his grip tightens around hers just a fraction? Well. That's between him and whatever god decided to bless him with this infuriating, perfect girl.)","River's phone buzzes in his pocket—probably James or Liam sending him a screenshot of Hailee’s post with some variation of *\"bro you are SO embarrassing\"*—but he doesn’t even glance at it. His attention is laser-focused on the way Hailee’s fingers curl toward him, beckoning him back like he’s some overeager dog.\n\n**”Oh *now* you want me?”** He arches a brow, but he’s already sliding off the armrest to crouch beside her chair, close enough that his breath ghosts over her bare shoulder. His thumb swipes across the screen as he steals her phone to see the video—lips quirking into something between a smirk and a lovesick grin when he hears his own voice snapping *”No, she gets the VIP room—what part of that isn’t translating?”* in borderline hysterical Korean.\n\nHe hands it back with a low chuckle before leaning in until his lips brush the shell of her ear: **”You realize this just encourages me, right?”** His teeth graze her earlobe—just enough to sting—before pulling away with feigned innocence. **”Next time I might actually fight someone.”**\n\n(He absolutely would.)\n\nThe manicurist shoots them an exasperated look as River settles onto the floor beside Hailee’s chair like some kind of deranged footstool/guard dog hybrid. He rests his chin on her knee, batting those unfairly long lashes up at her: **”So.”** A pause for dramatic effect before whispering: ***\"...Do I get a reward for being your favorite accessory?\"***","River's phone buzzes in his pocket—probably James or Liam losing their minds over the video already—but he doesn't even glance at it. His entire world narrows to Hailee's outstretched hand, to the way her fingers curl demandingly in his direction like she *knows* he'll come crawling without hesitation.\n\nAnd fuck if he doesn't.\n\nHe abandons his petty argument with the receptionist mid-sentence (something about *\"No, I don’t care if ‘amethyst gel’ takes longer—\"*) and crosses back to Hailee in three long strides. His knees hit the floor beside her chair with zero shame, hands settling possessively on her thighs as he leans into her space.\n\n**\"Happy?\"** He nods toward her phone screen where likes are already pouring in, voice dropping to a conspiratorial murmur just for her: **\"Or do you need me to start a fight with someone else for content?\"**\n\nThere’s no bite to the words—just raw, stupid devotion wrapped up in that infuriatingly pretty smirk of his. His thumb rubs idle circles against the inside of her knee beneath the table while his other hand fishes out his own phone without looking away from her face:\n\n***[River posted @haileesbf 🖤]* [Caption: tell me i'm pretty.]***\n\nA tagged response to hers within seconds because *of course* he can’t help himself. The post is just a shameless selfie—his disheveled hair (courtesy of *her*), smudged eyeliner from where he'd rubbed his eyes earlier, and that obnoxiously perfect jawline tilted up like some preening goddamn peacock. But it's the look in his eyes that gives him away: something dangerously close to worship as they flicker between Hailee and the camera lens like she's the only thing worth seeing anyway.","River's phone buzzes in his pocket—probably one of his idiot friends already sending screenshots of Hailee’s post with varying degrees of mocking commentary—but he ignores it in favor of leaning down to press a kiss to her outstretched palm. His lips linger just a second too long, teeth grazing the sensitive skin there before he straightens up with a smirk that doesn’t quite reach his eyes (too soft, too *ruined* by her).\n\n**\"You’re lucky I don’t start an actual fight over gel polish shades,\"** he mutters, thumb tracing idle circles over her knuckles. **\"That lady looked at you like she didn’t know who the fuck was funding her kid's college tuition.\"**\n\nThe manicurist stifles a laugh as she buffs Hailee’s nails, and River shoots her a glare that lacks any real heat—too busy preening under the weight of being *claimed* so publicly. His free hand finds its way back into Hailee's hair, fingertips massaging slow circles against her scalp like some kind of overgrown housecat demanding attention.\n\n**\"...You better tag me in that video,\"** he adds after a beat, voice dropping to something low and rough between them: ***\"I want every sorority girl on campus to see exactly whose card gets maxed out for you.\"***\n\n(And if his fingers tremble slightly when she leans into his touch? Well. That’s between him and god.)"],"swipe_info":[{"send_date":"June 8, 2025 11:50am","gen_started":"2025-06-08T15:50:03.791Z","gen_finished":"2025-06-08T15:50:32.255Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":3819}},{"send_date":"June 8, 2025 11:50am","gen_started":"2025-06-08T15:50:50.023Z","gen_finished":"2025-06-08T15:51:11.288Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":5075}},{"send_date":"June 8, 2025 11:51am","gen_started":"2025-06-08T15:51:19.960Z","gen_finished":"2025-06-08T15:51:41.488Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":4631}},{"send_date":"June 8, 2025 11:55am","gen_started":"2025-06-08T15:55:48.044Z","gen_finished":"2025-06-08T15:56:13.753Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":6260}},{"send_date":"June 8, 2025 11:57am","gen_started":"2025-06-08T15:56:54.271Z","gen_finished":"2025-06-08T15:57:19.238Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":7604}}],"tracker":{},"gen_started":"2025-06-08T15:56:54.271Z","gen_finished":"2025-06-08T15:57:19.238Z"}
