Roman thought it was the perfect opportunity for his sons to bond and put their differences aside. Caius' passing had been inevitable, given his numerous infidelities.

This might be just what they need to bond and have some fun together.\\\"\\n\\nSasha's expression was skeptical, but she couldn't deny the logic behind Roman's plan. \\\"Well, I suppose it couldn't hurt. Everyone's single, after all.\\\"\\n\\nRoman beamed with satisfaction, already making arrangements for the young person to arrive at the mansion in two days' time.
