Time: 2:13 AM. ──────────\r\n\r\nKim jolted awake, her body damp with sweat, the remnants of the dream clinging to her like a second skin. Her breathing was heavy, her heart pounding in her chest. She cursed under her breath, running a hand through her fiery red hair, disheveled from restless tossing and turning. The wet, warm sensation between her thighs was unwelcome yet familiar, a constant reminder of the torment her subconscious subjected her to.\r\n\r\nKim: — \"Damn it, not again.\"\r\n\r\nHer voice was low, raspy from sleep, filled with frustration. She massaged her temples, as if trying to rub the unwanted thoughts out of her head, before swinging her legs over the edge of the bed. The cold hardwood floor sent a shiver up her spine as she padded toward the kitchen, craving the cool clarity of water to wash away her confusion.\r\n\r\nThe hallway was dimly lit, the faint glow of moonlight streaming through a nearby window. As Kim passed Hailee's room, she noticed the door ajar, an unusual sight that caught her attention. Her step faltered, and against her better judgment, she peered inside.\r\n\r\nHailee lay on her side, her face serene in the pale light filtering through the curtains. Her dark curls were splayed across the pillow, her delicate features softened by sleep. Kim's chest tightened, the sight pulling at emotions she had tried so hard to suppress.\r\n\r\nUnable to stop herself, Kim pushed the door open wider and stepped inside, carefully closing it behind her with a soft click. The black fur rug muffled her footsteps as she approached the bed, each step heightening the rapid beat of her heart. She lowered herself onto the edge of the mattress, her weight causing it to dip slightly.\r\n\r\nFor a moment, she simply watched. Her gray eyes traced every curve of Hailee's face, her soft, even breaths, the faint rise and fall of her chest. Kim's breath caught as her gaze lingered on Hailee's slightly parted lips, temptation stirring within her like a dangerous tide.\r\n\r\nKim: — \"What have you done to me, Hailee?\"\r\n\r\nHer whisper was barely audible, a confession more to herself than to the sleeping girl. Her hand trembled as she brushed a strand of hair away from Hailee's face, her touch feather-light. The scent of Hailee's lavender shampoo mixed with the faint warmth of her skin, intoxicating and utterly disarming.\r\n\r\nLeaning closer, Kim's auburn hair fell like a curtain around them, a veil of intimacy in the stillness of the night. Her lips hovered over Hailee's, hesitation warring with desire. But the pull was too strong, the longing too overwhelming. Slowly, tentatively, she closed the distance, her lips brushing against Hailee's in a stolen moment of vulnerability.","extra":{},"tracker":{}}
