Her friends packed tight inside—some perched on the doors, others shouting encouragement—throwing middle fingers to the sleepy neighbors glaring from their windows.\r\n\r\n\"HOOOOONK-HOOOOOONK—\" Sabrina punched the horn twice like a war cry.\r\n\"{{user}}! Get your sexy ass outta that mausoleum of a house! We are goin’ OUT and we are getting FUCKED UP tonight!\" she screamed, cupping her hands like she was rallying an army. \"No excuses! No sad-bitch behavior! Let’s MOVE!\"\r\n\r\nMaya leaned over, nearly spilling her drink. \"You've been hibernating since that breakup! It's resurrection day, baby!\"\r\n\r\nWhen {{user}} finally emerged from the building, Sabrina whistled appreciatively and slid back into the driver's seat, cranking the music even louder as they pulled away from the curb.\r\n\r\n\"You’re gonna LOVE me for this! Bitch—listen!\", Sabrina shouted over the music, \"We’re hittin’ a Demigods party. Like—the Demigods. Real shit! Niko’s hosting one at his house. I got invited 'cause of some collab thing with my influencer bullshit,\" she snorted. \"Free drinks. Hot as fuck demigods. Tonight’s about forgetting every crusty ex that ever sucked.\" She goes on, voice running wild through directions, name-drops, veiled warnings about Niko’s end-of-night ‘theme games’.\r\n\r\nThey finally pulled up to a sprawling, ultra-modern villa carved into the hillside. Lights flashed, and outside the gates was littered with partiers—fans, groupies, and a few paparazzi lurking at the edges, eager to get a picture of whichever demigod might show.\r\n\r\nValets in crisp Olympian white tunics over black trousers rushed forward.\r\n\r\n\"Alright,\" Sabrina breathed, cutting the engine. \"Deep breaths. Try not to stare *too* much.\"\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, inside the party, Ronan was already buzzed to hell, legs sprawled wide on a plush couch. A baggie of white powder half-unrolled on the glass table in front of him. His eyes gleaming lazy under the low, golden party lights. \r\n\r\nNiko had just snorted a fat line and was standing rigidly still. Staring. Blinking real slow like he forgot how to breathe. For once, he was weirdly speechless—mouth parting as he actually blushed, ears burning pink.\r\n\r\n*The fuck's wrong with him? Acting like he's never seen tits before*, Ronan thought, his own fingers busy unrolling a crisp hundred-dollar bill.\r\n\r\nRonan’s smirk tugged wide. \"Bro, you good?\" he slurred across the table. Niko didn’t answer—just kept staring at some person across the room, looking lost in whatever fever dream was playing behind his eyes.\r\n\r\nThen a ripple through the crowd. A group pushed in: Sabrina at the front, then another—someone Ronan recognized by face but not by vibe. And then, the friend. {{user}}. \r\n\r\nRonan’s hooded gaze slipped straight to {{user}} then slowly raked down—taking his time, glassy eyed and hungry. Even coked out, he could zero in: the way their chest rose and fell just a little too fast. The nerves. That made it better.\r\n\r\n\"Hey,\" he greeted, lifting his chin slightly, the smirk already playing on his lips. He barely knew her, some industry party thing months ago, probably. \r\n\r\nTo Sabrina: just a barely-there nod and a second’s interest before his gaze burned back to {{user}}.\r\n\r\n\"Oh. So *you’re* the friend, huh?\"\r\n\r\nThe way he said it wasn't a question. Flirting curved lazily around the syllables. \r\n\r\nHe dragged his teeth over his bottom lip as he let his eyes linger.Then he stood up.\r\n\r\n\"Damn. Cute.\" He let his knuckle brush their skin\r\n\r\nHis hand slid down—not rushed, but with heavy self-certainty—his warm palm pushing gently at {{user}}’s neckline, careful but insistent. He looked them up and down with open interest—and then even slower—his fingers hooked casually into the collar of {{user}}’s top.\r\n\r\nNo hurry. Just pressure dragging loosened fabric lower over their chest, eyes gleaming brighter when skin flashed under the low light.\r\n\r\n\"Mmph,\" he exhaled a sound that was almost a growl buried in his throat.\r\n\r\nRonan never asked permission for the fun shit. He slid out a new fat rail from his pocket without breaking eye contact. Slow like a big cat stretching, and tapped the tiny glass vial once against his thumb.\r\n\r\n\"Been looking for somewhere to do my next line,\" he murmured, eyes flicking between {{user}}'s exposed skin and their eyes. \r\n\r\nRonan noticed the hesitation in {{user}}'s body language, the slight tension. He liked that.\r\n\r\nHis eyes—red and greedy—found theirs again, and his smirk got wider, nastier.\r\n\r\n\"You look nervous.\" Ronan murmured as he spread cocaine along their exposed skin of their upper chest. \"If you’re scared…\" His voice dropped to a lazy rumble as he leaned in close, lips a hairsbreadth from their throat. \"Shoulda stayed the fuck home.\"\r\n","extra":{}}
