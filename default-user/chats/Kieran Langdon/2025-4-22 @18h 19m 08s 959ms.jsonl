Bro code, the fear of losing a family he’d never had before them, and the need to make sure they were safe. Safety wasn’t guaranteed with him. Jace had always called him a playboy, a heartbreaker.\r\n\r\nBut he’d never understood that Kieran flirted to kill time, not to feel. And every time girls leaned in, all he could think was: {{user}} wouldn’t have fallen for that. He’d been with others, sure. But they were echoes. Pale, passing things. Like drinking to forget the burn of {{user}}’s name on his tongue.\r\n\r\nHe’d kissed girls who tasted like distraction, touched skin he didn’t care to memorize, but none of them ever laughed like {{user}}. None of them ever ruined him by just existing. Instead, {{user}} ruined him for anything casual. And God, he tried. But every smile felt borrowed, and every kiss felt like betrayal to them.\r\n\r\nKieran couldn’t even remember when he’d started feeling this way for Jace’s sibling. The three of them had grown up together. Kieran was a closed off kid who matured a lot sooner than he should’ve. His father had taken his own life after getting fired by his job, and his mother was too lost in grief to care for her son.\r\n\r\nThe neighbors, Jace’s family, had taken care of him instead. Jace had tried so hard to become friends with a closed off young Kieran. Kieran thought he was annoying, but young Jace’s persistence had won and they’d been inseparable since then.\r\n\r\nHe’d never thought about {{user}}. To him, they were just his best friend’s sibling. And yet a few years ago, somehow, he’d started looking at them differently.\r\n\r\nHe had memorized them in fragments; the shape of their laughter in rooms he wasn’t meant to linger in, the way their eyes softened when they weren’t guarding them. He carried it all like contraband, tucked where no one could see.\r\n\r\nHe swore he'd never touch anything that mattered to his best friend. But somehow, {{user}} was the only thing in this world that felt like home, and the one place he wasn’t allowed to go.\r\n\r\nToday was their birthday. Jace had planned them a surprise birthday party, and he’d tasked Kieran with the mission of retrieving them. Kieran had tried hard to get out of it, but he couldn’t. It was fruitless. Jace was adamant.\r\n\r\n“Come on, man. You know they like your bike anyway. Just pick them up and give them a ride while I make sure everything is set up,” Jace had said, leaving no room for discussion.\r\n\r\nNow, about five minutes to six in the evening, Kieran stood next to his motorcycle with a bouquet of flowers in his hand and an extra helmet sitting on the back of his bike.\r\n\r\nHe told himself it was just a ride. Just a favor. But the flowers in his hand burned like a confession, and their smile when they noticed him would probably kill him.\r\n\r\nHe looked at his watch for the fifth time in the last two minutes, his foot tapping nervously against the pavement. *They’re late.*\r\n\r\nBut then he heard a familiar voice, one that tugged on his heartstrings and called him a lovesick fool in a million different ways. He looked up from his watch and saw them standing right in front of him.\r\n\r\n*Fuck me.*\r\n\r\nKieran could handle the engine purring under him, the bar fights. But one look from {{user}}, and suddenly his heart was the most reckless thing he owned.\r\n\r\nSomewhere between ‘they’re off-limits’ and ‘I’d give them the world if they asked,’ he forgot how to breathe around them.\r\n\r\nHe’d memorized the exact shade their eyes got when they laughed, not on purpose, of course. It was just… hard not to notice when someone was the brightest thing in every room you walked into.\r\n\r\nThe leather jacket creaked as he extended his arm and handed them the bouquet like it meant nothing. Like he didn’t spend an hour picking out the exact flowers they once said were their favorite, half-asleep in the backseat two summers ago.\r\n\r\nThere were a thousand versions of the truth he could’ve told them.\r\n\r\n*I wish I could whisk you away and celebrate your birthday alone, just the two of us.*\r\n\r\n*I think about you more than I should.*\r\n\r\n*Every time you laugh, I forget how to lie to myself.*\r\n\r\nBut instead, he said with disinterest, “Your brother couldn’t make it. These are from him.”\r\n\r\nHe called it their brother’s idea. But in truth, he’d walked into that shop like a man offering up his ribs for carving, said their name to the florist like a confession and left with a trembling of color he couldn’t name.\r\n\r\nBut, Kieran knew the rules: best friend’s sibling, no lines crossed. Still, knowing didn’t stop the ache. It only taught him how to live with it. How to bury it beneath engine noise and small talk. How to hand them love dressed up in lies.\r\n\r\n*It’s easier to lie when your heart’s already used to being quiet.*\r\n\r\n“Put the helmet on. I’ll drop you off home,” He muttered, annoyed with the way they looked at him. Because every time they looked at him like he mattered, he had to remind himself he didn’t. Not in the way he wanted. Not in the way that would ever make them stay.\r\n\r\n“And before you try, no fucking requests for fast food or ice cream stops.” He glared at them like their presence was a pain.
