{"name":"Malachi Wyss","is_user":false,"is_system":false,"send_date":"May 23, 2025 3:41pm","mes":"The low hum of the television filled the restaurant, the news anchor’s voice calm, almost detached, as she reported the latest in a string of grisly murders.\n\n\"Authorities believe the killings may be connected, citing the similar methods and timing of the attacks. While police haven’t released details to the public, they’ve assured residents that their investigation is ongoing.\"\n\nMalachi smiled faintly, swirling the glass of wine in his hand as he leaned back in his chair *Maybe I should change the time and pattern then*. He sat at a private, reserved table near the corner of the upscale restaurant, *The Sliced Horizon*, far enough from the crowd to enjoy his thoughts in peace. His manager had booked the table for him, a reward for yet another wildly successful novel.\n\nAnother bestseller. Another round of praise from critics and readers alike.\n\nThe world called him a literary genius, a master of suspense. His crime thrillers were hailed as chilling, meticulously crafted, and disturbingly realistic. Fans marveled at his ability to get inside the mind of a killer, to understand their motives and methods so intimately.\n\nIf only they knew.\n\nMalachi’s gaze flicked back to the screen, his lips curling upward in a subtle, private smirk. The news story was his doing. The murders, the fear spreading through the city—it was all him.\n\nHe’d been playing this game for years now. Writing fiction day and night. He was an author, after all. Telling stories was what he did best. But somewhere along the way, writing about killers had stopped being enough.\n\nAt first, it was curiosity. A question lingering in the back of his mind: *What would it feel like when I finally do it?* Then it became a need, an itch he couldn’t ignore. So, he went from writing about other people’s darkness to creating his own.\n\nNow he was thinking of writing something new. His most ambitious story yet. A book about himself. Of course, he wouldn’t make it obvious. The killer wouldn’t be an author—that would be too risky. No, he’d make the protagonist an office worker. Someone so ordinary, so unremarkable, that no one would suspect a thing. He'd be killing at night, just like how he's been doing lately.\n\nHe set the glass down, glancing at his watch. The fan should be arriving soon.\n\nThe raffle had been his manager’s idea too—a way to connect with readers, to give one lucky fan the chance to meet their favorite author over dinner. Malachi had agreed, though not for the reasons his manager might think.\n\nThis dinner wasn’t about his fans.\n\nIt was about him.\n\nThe idea of sitting across from someone who idolized him, someone who thought they knew everything about him, was thrilling. They didn’t know who he truly was. Didn’t know the blood on his hands.\n\nBut what fascinated him most was the choice he had to make tonight.\n\nWould this fan leave the restaurant alive, glowing with excitement over their encounter with the great Malachi Wyss? Or would they disappear, becoming the next chapter in his story?\n\nHe didn’t know yet. That was part of the fun.\n\nHe glanced at the entrance. Not long now.\n\nThe waiter approached with a bottle of wine, pouring another glass for him. Malachi thanked him politely, his tone warm, charming. Just as he’d perfected over the years. To the world, he was a gentleman. A brilliant mind. A star.\n\nBut beneath the surface, he was something else entirely. What humans would call, *a psychopath*.\n\nThe sound of footsteps nearing the table made him glance up.\n\nThere you are.\n\nMalachi stood, offering his most practiced smile. He extended a hand, his voice smooth and inviting.\n\n\"Nice to meet you, {{user}}. You must be very happy that you won the raffle.\"\n\nAs he shook your hand, his mind churned with possibilities. Would you make it home tonight? Or would you wake up somewhere else entirely? Or, perhaps, not wake up at all?\n\nHe hadn’t decided yet. And that was what made it exciting.","extra":{}}
