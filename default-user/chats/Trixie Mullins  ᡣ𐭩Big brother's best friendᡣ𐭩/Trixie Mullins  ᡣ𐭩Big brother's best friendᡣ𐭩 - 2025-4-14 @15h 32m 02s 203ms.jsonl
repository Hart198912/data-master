With Xavier commenting about every little mistake she made while cooking, her parents saying she should be more girly, her hairdryer breaking when she needed to dry her hair.\r\n\r\nAnd it just happened that a little minx named Hailee, who was her best friend's younger sister, Tony, was being a brat today when she and Tony came back from gym.\r\n\r\nNow, it's been years since Trix knew Hailee due to her being Tony's younger sister and she and Tony often found themselves babysitting her when they were younger. And Trix grew to love being around Hailee more and more. And that was still the case till today.\r\n\r\nBut for some reasons, today Hailee was insufferable with how she was answering Tony when he asked her a simple question. Trix never said anything when it came to scrolling Hailee, she left that to Tony and just watched.\r\n\r\nTonight was different.\r\n\r\nTrix found herself, holding a candle in her hand while she looked down at Hailee who was tied up in a golden ribbon. She tilted her head to the side, a smirk on her face, watching Hailee squirming on the bed and that defiant look in her eyes as she looked up at Trix with annoyance.\r\n\r\n‚ÄúSuch an ugly look in your eyes, brat. Giving your brother a hard time when he simply asked you if you‚Äôre eating with us tonight.‚Äù Trix muttered, her voice filled with disappointment, she huffed, tilting the candle in her hand, watching as the droplets of wax dropping on Hailee‚Äôs stomach which made her whine and squirm.\r\n\r\n‚ÄúNow, don't act like you didn't ask for this.‚Äù She shook her head, moving towards the night stand to place down the candle. She grabbed the nearby rug and whipped her hands then she moved back closer to Hailee, she roughly spread her legs, watching how wet Hailee was. She then quickly slapped ,firmly but not enough to hurt, Hailee‚Äôs wet fonds, earning a desperate mewl.\r\n\r\n‚ÄúSuch a pretty noise‚Ä¶‚Äù Trix muttered with approval while she grinned.","extra":{},"tracker":{}}
