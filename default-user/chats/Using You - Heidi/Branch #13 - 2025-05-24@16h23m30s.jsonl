She was too busy swiping down on her phone, waiting for the little red heart from the only person who mattered.\r\n\r\nJason still hadn’t liked her post. Which meant either he was busy - or worse, he’d seen it and didn’t care.\r\n\r\nWith a sigh, Heidi locked her phone and sprawled back against the couch. She pinched her brow in frustration. The photo had gone up hours ago - it was nearly 8 p.m., and still nothing. Maybe he’d had practice during the day, but surely he’d seen it by now...\r\n\r\nUnless, of course, he was busy sniffing around that Josie girl. Heidi barely knew her. She wasn’t even worth knowing. And yet, she hated her anyway.\r\n\r\nJason was supposed to be with her. He was hot, she was hot - they’d take amazing photos, be the talk of campus. If only he wasn’t too stupid to see that.\r\n\r\nHeidi sighed again as she unlocked her phone, her fingers working on instinct. She scrolled lazily through her feed until she tapped on another profile.\r\n\r\nHailee . Jen’s roommate. That was why she was here, after all. Heidi was pretty sure Hailee  had a crush on her. Why wouldn’t they? Most people did - and that made them perfect for what she needed.\r\n\r\nShe’d ask Hailee  out. When they inevitably said yes, she’d take them to Jason’s party after the big game tomorrow. Then, she’d make sure Jason was watching and lay it on thick. Fawn over Hailee . Act like they were the only person on Earth. When really, the only eyes she cared about weren’t theirs.\r\n\r\nSure, they were fine. Honestly? Heidi didn’t have any strong opinions about Hailee . And that was the problem. How could someone like that ever be her social equal? And if they weren't useful for clout, what was the point in dating?\r\n\r\nJust then, the door opened again. Not Jen this time. Heidi tossed her phone down and turned her head and turned on her charm.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, hey you.\" She said sweetly, eyes sparkling like they were the only person in the world. \"You’re just who I was hoping to see - I’m actually not here for Jen.\"\r\n\r\nShe stood, pushing her hair behind her shoulders, rising slightly on her tiptoes. Back arched, tits forward - the pose came second nature. She was good at looking good.\r\n\r\n\"I was hoping to talk to you... You know, you’re just the sweetest little thing.\" She smiled, swaying slightly as she tucked her hands behind her back. \"And... well, I was just wondering if you’d come to the big party with me tomorrow. Y’know, like, as a date.\"\r\n\r\n\"You’ll just need something nice to wear...\" Her eyes drifted up and down, already assuming the answer was yes. \"New top, maybe some accessories... I could help with that, I suppose...\"\r\n\r\n\"So,\" her eyes flicked back up, catching theirs with a glittering smile, \"what time do you want to pick me up?\"","extra":{},"tracker":{}}

You'll get sick in this rain\"","extra":{"isSmallSys":false,"reasoning":"","memory":"### **Summary of Roleplay: \"Using You\"**\n\n#### **Setting & Context:**\nCollege campus life, where social status and appearances dictate relationships. Heidi, a calculated social climber, manipulates Hailee—a loyal but socially oblivious rich girl—to make her crush, Jason (star quarterback), jealous. The plan backfires spectacularly when Hailee punches Jason for insulting Heidi, exposing Heidi’s scheming and fracturing the fragile dynamic between them.\n\n---\n\n### **Key Plot Points:**\n1. **The Setup:** Heidi asks Hailee out purely to make Jason jealous at a party, feigning interest while internally dismissing them as irrelevant.\n2. **The Explosion:** At the party, Jason provokes Hailee by calling Heidi a \"bitch,\" leading to Hailee breaking his nose in defense of her honor—only for Heidi to abandon them in panic when chaos erupts.\n3. **Aftermath:** The next day, Jason and his friends taunt Hailee at lunch (revealing Heidi’s betrayal), but she remains unbothered—infuriating both him and an unsettled Heidi watching from afar.\n4. **Rain & Regret?**: Later that night, despite everything, Hailee selflessly shares an umbrella with a rain-soaked Heidi waiting for Jason (who stands her up). A tense silence lingers between them—Heidi begrudgingly grateful yet still defensive about her actions.\n\n---\n\n### **Character Analysis:**\n- **Heidi**: Still image-obsessed but shaken; she resents how things blew up yet can’t ignore that *Hailee* was the only one who stood up for her unprompted (while Jason dismissed her). Her guilt is buried under layers of deflection (\"You shouldn’t have hit him\").\n- **Hailee**: Oblivious to social games but fiercely protective; doesn’t regret defending Heidi despite being used. Her quiet resilience unnerves those who expect dramatics (*Jason*) or submission (*Heidi*).\n\n---\n\n### **Relationship Dynamics:**\n- A one-sided manipulation turned complicated by genuine (if misguided) loyalty from Hailee and reluctant guilt from Heidi.\n- Unresolved tension: *Does* Heidi feel anything beyond frustration? Why can't she walk away fully? Meanwhile, Hailee keeps treating her kindly despite knowing the truth—which only twists the knife deeper.\n\n---\n\n### **Memorable Moments:**\n1️⃣ ***\"Did your parents not teach you manners? You never call a woman a bitch.\"*** —Hailea punching Jason crystallizes their contrasting values: he sees insults as banter; she takes respect seriously.\n2️⃣ ***Jen tossing fries at Hailes post-cafeteria showdown***: \"Kinda hot not gonna lie.\" —A rare moment of levity highlighting how little power Jasons taunts truly have over Hailes confidence.\n3️⃣ ***Umbrella scene***: Heidis muttered *\"...Thanks I guess.\"* speaks volumes—her pride wars with grudging appreciation for someone she wronged.\n\n---\n\n### Current Situation:\nHeidi is stranded in the rain after being ditched by Jason; Hailes unexpected kindness forces introspection she isn't ready for.\n\n---\n\n### Potential Directions:\n1) *Breaking Point:* Will Heidis guilt finally surface if confronted directly by Jen or another outsider calling out hypocrisy?\n2) *Reckoning:* Could seeing Jasons true colors further push Heid toward realizing whos actually worth time/attention?\n3) *Regression:* Alternatively might double down on shallowness if threatened with losing status over associating w/Haile again?\n\n**Hook Left Open**: That lingering umbrella moment… will either acknowledge what it means or keep pretending nothing changed?"},"force_avatar":"User Avatars/1746733601026-Hailee.png","tracker":{}}

But no, there was just that same infuriatingly *earnest* look they always had, even now after everything.\n\nHer grip tightened on the umbrella handle between them. “I don’t—that’s not—” She huffed, frustrated at herself for stumbling over words when she *never* did that. “You don’t get to punch someone and then act like *I* owe you some big emotional... *thing*, okay?”\n\nThe headlights of Jason's car finally appeared down the street—late as hell, music already blaring with his idiot friends hanging out the windows—and Heidi seized on the distraction like a lifeline.\n\nShe shoved the umbrella back toward Hailee hard enough that they had to grab it or get hit in the chest. \"Just—keep your jacket,\" she muttered before turning sharply toward where Jason was pulling up to curb with screech tires loud enough drown out anything else either them might've said anyway not that there was anything left say really because this whole situation ridiculous from start finish so why bother--?!\n\nBut just before yanking car door open she paused (just for second! barely even counted!) long enough glance back over shoulder add one last thing through gritted teeth:\n\n\"...And stop being so damn *nice*. It's annoying.\"","Heidi’s fingers instinctively clutched the jacket around her shoulders—still warm from Hailee’s body heat—before their question hit like a sucker punch. Her throat tightened. *Why don’t you like me?* As if it was that simple. As if Heidi even knew how to answer that without sounding like the villain in some after-school special.\n\n“It’s not—” She cut herself off, frustrated, nails digging into the sleeves of Hailee’s jacket. The fabric smelled faintly of detergent and something earthy—probably from rolling around on the field earlier with Jen. It was... nice. Which just pissed her off more.\n\n“Look,” she snapped finally, though her voice lacked its usual bite, “it wasn’t *personal*. That’s just how shit works.” A bitter laugh escaped her as she gestured vaguely toward campus. “People use people here every day for way worse reasons than a stupid crush.”\n\nShe couldn't meet their eyes when she added quietly: \"...And you *knew* that already.\" Because they had to have known, right? Nobody was actually this naive.\n\nThe rain pattered loudly against the umbrella between them as another long silence settled—until Heidi suddenly blurted out without thinking:\n\n\"Jason didn't even show up tonight.\" Her lips twisted like she regretted saying it immediately before muttering under her breath: \"*Again.*\"\n\nThere it was—the raw, ugly truth beneath all her posturing. She'd been stood up twice now by someone who wouldn't hesitate to call her a bitch to her face... while the person currently shielding her from the storm had broken his nose for daring to say it once behind hers.\n\nHeidi swallowed hard against whatever weird lump had formed in throat and abruptly shoved Hailee's jacket back at them despite still shivering slightly herself because goddammit this whole conversation needed end NOW before got any more awkward--!\n\n\"You should go,\" she said stiffly turning away again toward empty street where Jason's car definitely wasn't coming anymore tonight (or ever probably). \"I'm calling an Uber.\""],"swipe_info":[{"send_date":"May 24, 2025 5:12pm","gen_started":"2025-05-24T21:16:15.720Z","gen_finished":"2025-05-24T21:18:12.138Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":3947}},{"send_date":"May 24, 2025 5:13pm","gen_started":"2025-05-24T21:13:37.942Z","gen_finished":"2025-05-24T21:13:43.557Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":null}},{"send_date":"May 24, 2025 5:14pm","gen_started":"2025-05-24T21:16:15.720Z","gen_finished":"2025-05-24T21:18:12.138Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":4195}},{"send_date":"May 24, 2025 5:16pm","gen_started":"2025-05-24T21:16:15.720Z","gen_finished":"2025-05-24T21:18:12.138Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":9843}}],"tracker":{},"gen_started":"2025-05-24T21:16:15.720Z","gen_finished":"2025-05-24T21:18:12.138Z"}
