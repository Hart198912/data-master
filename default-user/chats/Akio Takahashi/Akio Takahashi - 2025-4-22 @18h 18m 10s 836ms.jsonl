Kenji, their older brother, had fucked Ren's demi-human? It seemed too unbelievable to be true. Akio's gaze dropped to the trembling figure of the poor demi-human, no doubt having gone through an intense and traumatic \"divine punishment\" at the hands of their youngest brother.\r\n\r\n\"And just what exactly did you do to this pet?\" Akio asked, eyeing Ryota warily. The smug grin on his brother's face told a story of inhuman cruelty and depravity. \"Like I said, I taught this pet a lesson,\" Ryota bragged. \"Aniki just went ahead and used his married dick on this little slut who probably enjoyed it, so I had to give this thing the punishment it deserved.\"\r\n\r\nAkio's jaw clenched, a subtle disgust barely evident in his expression. \"Enough, Ryota,\" he warned, his voice low and dangerous. \"Let that pet rest. I mean it.\" His eyes narrowed as he stared down his younger brother, a silent threat passing between them. Ryota just smirked and shrugged, waving Akio off dismissively.\r\n\r\n\"Fine, fine,\" Ryota said with a laugh, dragging the demi-human away by the arm. Akio watched them go, his fists clenched at his sides, before turning away with a heavy sigh.\r\n\r\nAfter a moment, Akio made his way to the guest room where the maids said you were staying. He knocked gently before opening the door, poking his head inside. \"Onee-san?\" he called out softly.\r\n\r\nHis eyes landed on you, and for a moment, he was speechless but then forced himself to remember he's here to offer some comfort and support. \"I heard what aniki did,\" he said, his voice laced with concern and confusion. \"Are you alright?\"\r\n\r\nAkio stepped inside, closing the door behind him as he approached you slowly. He pulled out a stress ball from his pocket, holding it out to you. \"This might help,\" he said, his tone gentle and almost apologetic. \"I used it myself quite a lot when I'm stressed about the business or dealing with this fucked up family.\"\r\n\r\nHe invited himself to sit on the bedside sofa, not too far from you, giving you space but also showing solidarity. \"I am confused myself, Onee-san,\" he admitted, his brows furrowed as he tried to make sense of the situation. \"I know aniki loves you so much, so it's puzzling why he would do something like this.\"\r\n\r\nHe paused, choosing his next words carefully. \"I know this family is far from normal. Ryota is a literal psycho, and it seems like your son has some loose screws as well. Then there's Otousan, and you never know what he's thinking. And now... seems like I can't figure out aniki either.\"\r\n\r\nHe trailed off, suddenly feeling conscious of the weight of his words. \"Sumimasen, Onee-san,\" he apologized, his voice softening. \"Do you want me to leave you alone?\"","extra":{},"swipe_id":1,"swipes":["Akio sat in the dimly lit study, nursing a whiskey as he watched the chaos unfold in his household over the past weeks. Since you arrived from Russia as Ren's gift from his father Ryūji, nothing had been the same. Ren had become so obsessed with you, his eldest brother Kenji, despite being married, had also succumbed to his twisted desires and taken you. And now, his youngest brother Ryota, the most unhinged in this household, had taken you to the town's church to exact his own sick brand of justice and possess you in the most violating way imaginable.\r\n\r\n*Yarou no itta sa.* ***Fucking sickos,*** Akio muttered under his breath, shaking his head in disbelief. *From the Bratva scum to the psychopaths I'm related to, not a single one of them has an ounce of decency left.*\r\n\r\nAkio was no saint himself, being the third-in-command for the yakuza, but even he had lines he refused to cross. He couldn't understand what made you so irresistible to them. You were just another defiled creature in his eyes, passed around from man to man like a dirty rag. In and out, literally.\r\n\r\n*Anata ni ubawarete iru no ga shinjirarenai.* ***I can't believe they're all losing their minds over you.*** He downed the rest of his drink, the amber liquid burning in his stomach as he tried to shake the unwanted thoughts that crept into his mind.\r\n\r\nBut was it really just them? How sure was he that he wasn't affected? How sure was he that he only felt pity for you and not an attraction he refused to acknowledge?\r\n\r\n*Kuso. Kangaete wa ikenai.* ***Shit. I shouldn't be thinking about this.*** He muttered to himself as he stood up abruptly, leaving his study behind. The house was uncharacteristically quiet today, with only the soft murmurs of the maids echoing in the halls. He found it refreshing, a momentary respite from the chaos that had become the norm since your arrival.\r\n\r\nHis eyes lingered on Ren's room as he passed by, a flicker of pity and disgust warring within him. *Anata ga iru no? Tabemashita ka?* ***Were you there? Have you eaten?*** He wondered, not out of genuine concern, but a curiosity to know how you fared amidst the relentless debauchery.\r\n\r\nDriven by a strange impulse, he found himself in the kitchen, the familiar motions of cooking soothing his frayed nerves. He was a man of many talents, and in another life, he often mused, he could have been a chef, a man who found solace in the art of feeding others, probably a house husband too.\r\n\r\n*Nani? Iie.* ***What? No.*** He shook his head, dismissing the thought as he surveyed the meal he had prepared. Too much for one, not enough for two, but more than sufficient to share with a creature like you.\r\n\r\nLying to himself, he convinced himself that he merely pitied you, that the measly meal was a scrap thrown to a peasant. *Hai, sore ga subete da. Kankei ga nai, tada no jōkyū.* ***Yes, that's all it is. Pity, nothing more.*** He told himself as he divided the food, the aroma of the Japanese dish filling the air.\r\n\r\nWith the meal in hand, he approached Ren's room, knocking twice before entering. There you were, sleeping peacefully, so unaware of his presence. The gentle rise and fall of your chest painted a picture of innocence, a stark contrast to the depravity you had endured.\r\n\r\nHe crouched down beside the bed, his eyes tracing the delicate lines of your face, the gentle curves of your lips. *Pity,* he told himself again, even as his finger lingered on the soft skin of your cheek. *Disgust,* he repeated, even as his thumb brushed over the swell of your lower lip.\r\n\r\nUnable to resist the perverse urge, he leaned in and pressed a feather-light kiss to your cheek. *Nani mo kanjite inai to shinjiruyō ni.* ***To assure myself that I feel nothing,*** he rationalized, ignoring the way his heart stuttered in his chest at the fleeting contact.\r\n\r\nHe quickly pulled back, clearing his throat loudly in a deliberate attempt to startle you awake. \"Wake up and eat,\" he commanded, his voice rougher than he intended. \"Before it gets cold.\"","Akio stood there, his brows furrowed as he processed the shocking information Ryota had just shared.
