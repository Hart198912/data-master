{"name":"Landon Reynolds","is_user":false,"is_system":false,"send_date":"June 28, 2025 11:28pm","mes":"\"Tell me again how she deserved it,\" Landon purred, dragging the blade down his victim's sternum. Blood pearled in its wake, bright against the fluorescent lights of his basement. \"Tell me how breaking your wife's ribs was justified because dinner wasn't hot enough.\"\r\n\r\nThe man's – Derek Smith, age 42, history of domestic violence – screams echoed off the walls, muffled by the gag but still music to Landon's ears. Blood had already soaked through the pristine white of Landon's rolled-up dress shirt, spattering his forearms like abstract art.\r\n\r\n\"No? Nothing to say?\" Landon's blade danced lower. \"Funny how men like you go quiet when someone bigger comes along.\"\r\n\r\nHis phone buzzed. Hailee's message lit up the screen – another \"working dinner\" with her new boss Ronan. Landon's grip tightened on the blade until his knuckles went white.\r\n\r\n*Ronan fucking Carter. 39. Divorced. known for \"mentoring\" young female associates.*\r\n\r\nThe rage that surged through Landon was familiar – the same burning fury he'd felt watching Cole pawing at Hailee all those years ago. Poor, stupid Cole, who just wouldn't take the hint after Landon orchestrated his \"cheating\" scandal.\r\n\r\n*\"Hailee, please, you have to believe me! I would never—\"*\r\n\r\n\"Drunk driving is such a tragedy,\" Landon had said at Cole's funeral, holding Hailee while she cried. \"He should have called for a ride.\"\r\n\r\nLandon laughed suddenly, the sound sharp and unhinged. \"You know what's funny? Everyone thinks Cole —my wife's ex – died in a drunk driving accident. Poor bastard wrapped his car around a tree after she caught him cheating.\" His voice dropped to a whisper. \"Want to know a secret? I arranged everything. The girl who seduced him, the 'accidental' discovery, the tampered brakes... Because he wouldn't stop trying to explain himself to Hailee. Kept saying it was all a misunderstanding.\"\r\n\r\nThe man whimpered through his gag.\r\n\r\n\"Oh right, you're still here.\" Landon blinked, as if remembering his current task. \"Sorry, where are my manners? We were discussing your hobby of using your wife as a punching bag.\" A pause. \"See, that reminds me of someone – my father. He was my first kill, you know. Fifteen years old, and I made it look like an accident. My brother helped hide the evidence. Family bonding at its finest.\"\r\n\r\nLandon's phone rang. Cullen's name flashed on the screen.\r\n\r\n\"Speaking of the devil,\" Landon answered, putting it on speaker. \"I'm a bit occupied, brother.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is that why I hear muffled screaming?\" Cullen's voice was dry. \"Taking out your Carter frustrations on another wife-beater?\"\r\n\r\n\"You know me so well.\" Landon peeled back a strip of skin, earning another scream. \"What's up?\"\r\n\r\n\"Need your legal expertise on the Harrison precedent. But please, don't let me stop you from... whatever that is.\"\r\n\r\n\"Multitask? I can do that.\" Landon switched to a larger blade. \"Harrison case was all about intent. Check the footnotes in section twelve – that's where they buried the good stuff. Like I'm about to bury our friend here.\"\r\n\r\nThe man thrashed against his restraints, making Landon laugh.\r\n\r\n\"Got it. Don't forget to clean up.\" Cullen said before the line went dead.\r\n\r\n\"Love you too, you antisocial bastard.\" Landon said anyways.\r\n\r\n\"Now then,\" Landon turned back to his victim, eyes gleaming. \"where were we? Ah yes. Your pièce de résistance.\"\r\n\r\nThe skinning took precision. Patience. Landon hummed as he worked. Derek's screams grew weaker, then stopped altogether.\r\n\r\nThe mountain dirt was soft from recent rain, perfect for burial. As Landon worked the shovel, his mind drifted to Hailee. Sweet, innocent Hailee, who had no idea her \"stalker\" from years ago was the same man who'd \"saved\" her, married her, worshipped her.\r\n\r\n*The same man who was going to have to do something about Ronan Carter.*\r\n\r\nBack at the villa, Landon scrubbed the night's work from his skin, hot water turning pink at his feet. Steam fogged the mirrors as he stepped out, wrapping a towel low on his hips. Droplets traced paths down the tattoos decorating his throat, chest, and arms – a canvas of carefully chosen art that hid the monster beneath.\r\n\r\nHis phone lit up with Hailee's activity. Every keystroke she made on her phone appeared on his screen in real-time. Her clumsy typing told Landon everything he needed to know about her sobriety level.\r\n\r\n\"Fucking perfect.\" he muttered, running a hand through his damp hair. Drunk Hailee was always entertaining, but the fact that she was drunk with *Carter* made his blood boil. \r\n\r\nThree minutes later, Landon was dressed in a black turtleneck and trench coat, stalking through the garage to his matte black Maserati. The peonies he'd picked earlier waited in the passenger seat – Hailee's favorites, because he remembered every detail she'd ever shared, even throwaway comments from high school.\r\n\r\n*High school.* When she'd smiled at the weird, quiet kid everyone avoided. Shared her lunch with him, like he was worthy of her kindness. She'd made him feel human, and he'd been obsessed ever since.\r\n\r\nNow some fucking corporate climber thought he could mentor his way into her life?\r\n\r\nLandon's foot pressed harder on the accelerator, the engine's growl matching his mood. His mind filled with vivid fantasies – Carter's throat under his hands, Carter's blood painting the pavement, Carter's body joining the others in the mountain soil.\r\n\r\n*Not yet,* he forced himself to think. *Too obvious. Too soon.*\r\n\r\nHe found them outside the restaurant, and the sight of Ronan Carter's hand hovering near Hailee's elbow made his jaw clench.\r\n\r\n\"Let me drive you home, Hailee. It's not safe—\"\r\n\r\n\"That won't be necessary.\" Landon's voice cut through the night like a blade. He moved forward, all predatory grace. \"I've got my wife.\"\r\n\r\nHe caught Hailee as she stumbled forward, using the momentum to pull her into a kiss that was all possession. His eyes locked on Carter over her shoulder, and for once, he didn't bother hiding the darkness there. Let this presumptuous fuck see exactly what he was dealing with.\r\n\r\n*Touch her again and they'll never find your body.*\r\n\r\n\"Drive safely, Mr. Carter.\" Landon said after breaking the kiss. \"People have been going missing lately. Such dangerous times we live in.\"\r\n\r\nAt his car, Landon shrugged off his coat, the movement graceful. \"Stay still,\" he commanded, draping it over his wife's shoulders. His fingers worked each button methodically, voice sharp with controlled irritation. \"Christ, just how many drinks did they ply you with, mm?\"\r\n\r\nHe then stilled for a moment, drinking in her face, the slight sway in her stance. If it were up to him, she wouldn't be working at all. He could give her everything – every fucking thing she could ever want. He hadn't clawed his way from nothing to becoming Chicago's most successful defense attorney just to watch his wife exhaust herself for a paycheck she didn't need.\r\n\r\nBut he couldn't tell her that. Not yet. Pushing too hard would make her bolt, and he hadn't spent years orchestrating their perfect life to fuck it up now.\r\n\r\n\"What am I going to do with you?\" he murmured, dropping his forehead to her shoulder. \"I just want to lock you up. Keep you where only I can see you.\"\r\n\r\nThe words were barely a whisper against her skin, a moment of raw honesty he only allowed because she was too drunk to remember. Then the mask slipped back into place, and he helped her into the car.\r\n\r\nBut then everything went sideways when Hailee reached for the glove compartment, and the USB drive – hours of his finest work, his trophies – clattered to the floor of his Maserati.\r\n\r\n*Fuck.*\r\n\r\nLandon snatched it up before her fingers could close around it. *Stupid, stupid, stupid.* He'd been so consumed with thoughts of Carter he'd forgotten to leave it at the villa.\r\n\r\n\"Just boring case files, baby.\" He pocketed the drive, already planning his return to the villa once she was asleep. \"Let's get you home. You're barely keeping your eyes open.\"\r\n\r\nAs Landon pulled away from the curb, his eyes flickered to Ronan Carter's reflection in the rearview mirror. One day, that fucker would cross a line. And Landon would be ready.\r\n\r\nHe always was.","extra":{},"tracker":{}}
