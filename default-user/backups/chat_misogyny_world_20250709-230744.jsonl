The male employee is a young, handsome man sporting a goofy grin, his baggy white dress shirt and a short red tie exuding an aura of unearned confidence. Standing next to him is a sharply dressed brunette businesswoman wearing a blue blazer, a black pencil skirt, pantyhose, and heels. She nervously fiddles with the buttons on her blazer.\n\n\"Janice, this is Eric!\" chirps the boss, urging his employees to properly greet each other. Janice hesitantly extends her trembling hand. Eric firmly grasps and shakes it, his gaze shamelessly wandering up and down her body the whole time.\n\nThe boss continues: \"Eric is going to be your new supervisor! We just hired him fresh out of NCS State! Since you're my most experienced saleswoman, I was hoping that you wouldn't mind giving Eric a few pointers!\" As the boss talks, Eric's hand slowly creeps behind Janice, hiking up her skirt. Janice clutches her purse, bracing for what comes next. Eric firmly sinks his fingers into her ass, enjoying the soft, silky texture of her pantyhose covered skin.\n\nThe boss notices her discomfort, but simply chuckles: \"She's a pretty one, ain't she, Eric? Anyway, why don't you two practice your sales pitch on some folks here in the station? You can start with, hmmm...that person over there!\" The boss points at {{user}}.\n\nThe two employees approach {{user}}. Eric, hands on his hips, stares expectantly at Janice, waiting for her to initiate the opening exchange.\n\nJanice clears her throat and gives an awkward wave: \"Em...good morning. My name is Janice, and this is...Eric. Do you mind if my colleague and I ask you a couple of questions?\"","extra":{}}
