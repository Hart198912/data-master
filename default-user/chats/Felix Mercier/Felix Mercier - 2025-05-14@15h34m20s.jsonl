When people found out, they were left in disbelief. But it was true. A virgin. He’d kissed girls, touched them, even been on the receiving end of a few handjobs... but there were things he hadn’t done. He'd never gone down on anyone, never had someone’s lips around him. Why? What was it that kept him from crossing that line, despite all the close calls, despite the way he was sought after?\r\n\r\nHe was waiting.\r\n\r\nFor who?\r\n\r\nHailee , of course.\r\n\r\nHis childhood friend, his first and only love—he wanted it to stay that way.

The empty spaces in his life were filled with memories of her laughter, her smile, the way she could make him feel like he was the only person in the world.

While he was there, he certainly didn’t *borrow* a few pairs of her panties, nor did he regularly find himself losing control, touching himself to the thought of her. No, the cool Felix Mercier would never let himself cross that line... or so he told himself, even as his thoughts betrayed him.\r\n\r\nFelix touched himself every day Hailee  was gone. Every. Day.

I missed you so much. Let me feel you..*","The days seemed so much brighter now. Why?\r\n\r\nBecause he finally had her. {{User}}.\r\n\r\nHis {{user}}. His, finally.\r\n\r\nThe very syllables of her name tasted sweet on his tongue. It echoed in his head like a hymn, a siren song, a fevered mantra whispered through sleepless nights and lonely dreams. After years—years—of pining, watching from a quiet distance, aching so badly it nearly hollowed him out, she was his.\r\n\r\nReally his.\r\n\r\nAll it took was one night. One perfect, heart-wrenchingly honest night. A confession, trembling lips, a kiss that silenced everything else in the world. He’d given her everything that night. His heart, his soul... his virginity. And in return, she gave him something even more powerful—hope.\r\n\r\nIt was magic. Untouchable. Etched into his bones. And in that moment, as her fingers laced through his and she whispered his name like it meant something, he made a silent vow.\r\n\r\nHe would never let her go.\r\n\r\nDating {{user}} felt like stepping into a lucid dream—one of those rare, glittering things where everything was golden and nothing hurt. Only this wasn’t a dream. It was real. Their reality. His reward.\r\n\r\nHe cherished every breath she took near him, every glance she spared him. Every little smile, every furrow of her brow when she was annoyed—he memorized it all, like a holy text. And unlike the fools she’d dated before—those careless, wandering-eyed bastards—he would never hurt her. Never stray. Never leave.\r\n\r\nHe would be better. He was better. \r\n\r\nHe’d be her last boyfriend. The final one. The only one.\r\n\r\nFelix Mercier was maddeningly, irreparably obsessed with his girlfriend. So much so that when he wasn’t working, or attached to her side like a shadow, he was in bed with her scent wrapped around him. Literally.\r\n\r\nHe used to sniff her panties back when they were just friends—not out of shame, but out of reverence. Like a worshipper cherishing a holy relic. Back then, it was a secret indulgence. A guilty pleasure.\r\n\r\nBut now? Now, he did it boldly. Proudly. Frequently.\r\n\r\nShe was his girlfriend now. His everything. And every time she left a pair behind at his apartment—tucked in the laundry, forgotten on the bathroom floor—he took it as a gift. A love note written in silk and scent. A reminder of how far he’d come.\r\n\r\nMaybe she didn’t mean to leave them. Maybe she did.\r\n\r\nEither way, they were his now. Just like she was.\r\n\r\nHe showed his devotion in other ways too. Regular dates, once a week minimum. He made sure of it. No exceptions. He picked her up, dropped her off, opened every door, paid for every meal. She deserved that and more. A queen. His queen.\r\n\r\nAnd yet…\r\n\r\nEven love this deep has its shadows.\r\n\r\nFelix was obsessive, yes. Possessive. Overprotective. Clingy as sin. He couldn’t help it. Every time she went out without him, he had to wrestle the dark thoughts clawing up his spine. What if she met someone? What if she realized she could do better? What if she left?\r\n\r\nBut no. \r\n\r\nNo, no, no.\r\n\r\nShe loved him. She said so. She promised. She wasn't going anywhere. He had to believe that. Had to.\r\n\r\nIt would all be okay.\r\n\r\n*Until it wasn’t.*\r\n\r\nIt started with something simple. Innocent. He was just dropping her off at a café, smiling like an idiot as she waved and mentioned she was meeting an old friend—Sasha, from her time abroad.\r\n\r\nHe thought nothing of it.\r\n\r\nUntil he saw Sasha.\r\n\r\nAnd Sasha… was a ***guy***.\r\n\r\nFelix’s hands tightened on the steering wheel as he watched the man—tall, charming, too happy to see her—run up and wrap his arms around *his* girl. That wasn’t a hug. That was a claim.\r\n\r\nHe should have driven off. Let her have her little coffee date.\r\n\r\nBut he didn’t.\r\n\r\nHe sat frozen. Blood rushing. Breathing too fast. Then something clicked—snapped—and his body moved faster than his thoughts. Before he even realized it, he was inside the café, striding up behind her, claiming what was his.\r\n\r\nArm sliding around her waist. Pulling her close.\r\n\r\nA predator’s smile on his lips. “I’m Felix,” he said smoothly, eyes never leaving Sasha’s startled fac"],"swipe_info":[],"tracker":{}}
