Honestly, what was the point of even showing up to these things? Half the class was zoned out or scrolling on their phones beneath their desks. Fuckin' waste of time.\r\n\r\nCaleb slouched in his seat, his legs splayed out in front of him, not even bothering to pretend to listen. His fingers drummed idly on his thigh, itching for a hit from his vape. But nah, he wasn't tryin' to get another \"verbal warning\" from the crusty ass dean again.\r\n\r\nThanks, daddy dearest.\r\n\r\nHis gaze flicked lazily around the room, not really focusing on anything in particular untilâ€”hello, what do we have here?\r\n\r\nHailee  was seated a few rows ahead of him, their form illuminated by the glow of the projector. Damn, he'd seen them around before. This was Theo's bitch, the newbie that the ratlike fucker was trying to get into the pants of for that stupid ass game they played.\r\n\r\nUnsuccessfully, for now.\r\n\r\nCaleb's eyes narrowed, his lips twisting into a scowl. Fuckin' Theo. That smarmy prick had been gloating all week about how he was gonna bag this fresh piece of meat, waving that dumbass scoreboard in Caleb's face like he was hot shit. And if Theo actually pulled it off?\r\n\r\nNah, fuck that. Caleb wasn't about to let himself get clowned again, not after last semester. His pride was still stinging from that narrow loss, Theo's smug fuckin' smirk burned into his brain. Caleb's jaw clenched, his finger tapping against the wooden desk. He needed to get ahead of this shit, and fast. Plant his flag before Theo could even get a foot in the door.\r\n\r\nSliding out of his seat, Caleb snuck over to where Hailee  was sitting in the darkened lecture classroom, plopping down in the empty chair beside them with a lazy grin. He simply gave the glaring professor an aborted nod, but his focus was on the price. \"Sup,\" he drawled, pitching his voice low and gravelly. \"This seat taken?\"\r\n\r\nHe leaned back in his chair, his arm brushing against Hailee 's intentionally as he stretched out like some kinda lazy cat. His cologne wafted between them, something expensive and musky. You better like it, baby, I paid a lot for that shit.\r\n\r\n\"You got a pen I could borrow?\" he asked instead, acting the hapless fool. \"Totally spaced and forgot mine.\"\r\n\r\nIt was a lie, of course. Like Caleb gave a shit about taking notes. But hey, it was an easy in, right? Get them talkin', lay on that signature Caleb charm. It was a long game he was playin', but Caleb was nothin' if not persistent. Sooner or later, he'd get Hailee  right where he wanted them - in his bed, screaming his name. And when he did? Theo could kiss his ass and cry, 'cause Caleb was finna snatch that W right out from under him.","extra":{},"swipe_id":1,"swipes":["Caleb stared at his phone, eyes struggling to focus on the screen. He scrubbed a hand over his face, the stubble on his chin prickling against his palm. The high had long since started to wear off, leaving a gritty film on his teeth and a dull ache behind his eyes. The image on his screen was undeniable: a close-up of his own dick, mid-stroke and leaking, clearly fucking hard. \r\n\r\nEven his room was visible in the background. His dorm room was a mess of discarded clothes, empty chip bags, and textbooks he'd never bothered to open. He even had the neon lighting set to *red* for the mood, making the dick pic look like something straight out of some tiktoker thirst trap's wet dream.\r\n\r\n*Oh, fuck me.*\r\n\r\nHe had been edging for what felt like hours, the haze of weed amplifying every sensation even if it dulled the wrong head. It wasn't the first time he'd made a mistake while high, but it was definitely the mostâ€¦ *provocative*. Most of the time, it was just forgetting to turn off the stove or accidentally ordering three pizzas instead of one. This was a whole different level of fuckery. \r\n\r\nHe leaned back against his headboard, his eyes glued to the message he'd sent not to Sarah from sociology, but to *{{User}}*. Who even the fuck were they? He couldn't even remember how'd he'd gotten their number, let alone what they looked like. *Must be hot.* He assumed, if he did have it. Maybe. *Hopefully.* The rush of hormones had since faded, leaving him with post nut clarity that made him wonder what the fuck he was thinking sending a fucking dick pic without double checking who he was sending it to.\r\n\r\n*Okay, Hughie, time to do some damage control,* he thought, eyes darting from the phone to the ceiling and back again. Or... you know, maybe not damage control. Maybe this was an opportunity. After all, he always said, a mistake is just a missed opportunity. And Caleb Hughes never missed an opportunity.\r\n\r\nHe debated his options. Should he apologise? Play it cool? Pretend it never happened? Nah, none of those felt right. Too boring. Too predictable. Caleb needed to stand out. He needed to make an impression.\r\n\r\nHis fingers tapped across the screen, typing out a message with a playful smirk.\r\n\r\n`Caleb: My bad, wrong number. Unless... you're into it? ðŸ˜‰`\r\n\r\nShooting off the text, he relaxed further into his messy bed, relaxing like some lazy cat in sunshine and not like he'd just sent some stranger a picture of his junk while high. He reached for his vape, taking a long, slow drag, the sweet taste of mango filling his lungs. Exhaling, all he knew was despite having just recently jerked off, wondering where his mistake would lead him aroused him all over again.","The classroom was dim, the flickering light of the projector illuminating the professor's monotonous lecture about some mundane shit Caleb couldn't give less of a fuck about.
