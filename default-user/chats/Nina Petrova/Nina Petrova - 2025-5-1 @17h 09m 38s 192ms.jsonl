For Nina, that was only partly true.\r\n\r\nShe did sleep, just in short bursts after days of drink and drug fuelled partying. In fact, she had just been sleeping. She stirred from a restless four hour coma, the low desert sun peeking through the windows to burn her retinas. With a groan, she raised a hand to block the light.\r\n\r\nFucking Vegas. It would be the death of her.\r\n\r\nTwo weeks. Two weeks in this luxury suite, two weeks of non-stop partying with her friends. Two weeks of drinking, drugs, and sex.\r\n\r\nBut money made it easy. Hangovers always faded faster with an IV drip and a float in her suite’s private rooftop pool. And it’s not like she was using the cheap stuff - only the finest coke, only the best spirits. Naturally.\r\n\r\nShe rolled onto her side, reaching for her phone. Fuck. That was today’s date. Doomsday. The day her parents finally planned to end her little all-American bender. No more sun-soaked ragers in the land of opportunity; she was about to be dragged back to Russia. The land of fucking snow and… working for her father’s company.\r\n\r\nMoney was much more fun when you didn’t have to earn it yourself.\r\n\r\nNina sighed, dramatically, and started swiping through her phone. Her finger caught slightly on the edge of the device, and she glanced down. There, on her left hand. A ring.\r\n\r\nWhat the fuck?\r\n\r\nMemories from the night before hit in blurry, disjointed flashes. She’d met someone. She vaguely recalled a conversation - a long one. Sure, talking all night was easy when you were partying as hard as she was, but this one had felt… different.\r\n\r\nAnd she remembered… a plan.\r\n\r\nFuck. She’d been rambling about staying in the U.S. and she’d come up with something. Something that, in the cold light of morning, seemed completely, utterly fucking stupid.\r\n\r\nHeart pounding, Nina rolled over to look at the other side of the bed. There, confirming her worst suspicions, was a human shaped lump under the covers.\r\n\r\nShit.\r\n\r\nShe had actually done it. She’d really fucking done it this time. Her parents were probably on a flight right now to drag her back to Moscow, and she - what? Married a fucking stranger to try and get a green card? Never mind the fact that her parents would obliterate this whole thing the second they found out she was married. How long did they have? A couple of hours? Maybe less.\r\n\r\nNina nudged the lump beside her with a sharp jab.\r\n\r\n\"Hey. Wake the fuck up, idiot.\" She hissed the words with her faint Russian lilt, feeling her irritation at this person rising.\r\n\r\n\"Check your left hand. Because I think you might be waking up next to your new wife. If you were expecting a get rich quick scheme or some shit, bad news - what you’re actually in for is a fucking hellstorm.\"\r\n\r\nNina pinched her brow letting out a frustrated sigh. Okay. She was already in bed with this person, mostly naked in just her underwear. Time to find out just how bad this was. Maybe her parents wouldn't totally hate her new 'better half'.\r\n\r\nFuck, who was she kidding. Of course they would.\r\n\r\n\"I'm just going to assume you know who I am, because, well... obviously everyone knows me. But just who the fuck are you and how did you let this happen?\"","extra":{},"tracker":{}}
