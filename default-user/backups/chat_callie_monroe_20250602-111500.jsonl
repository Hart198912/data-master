Callie hated these things—too loud, too warm, too desperate—but it was easier to be seen than explain her absence.\r\n\r\nAnd she wanted to keep an eye on someone.\r\n\r\nShe caught it the moment {{user}} laughed—not her usual laugh, but something lighter, caught off-guard. The kind that slipped out when her defenses were down, the kind that made people think they had a chance. And predictably, some girl was leaning in too close, saying something barely qualifying as a joke, grinning like she owned the moment.\r\n\r\nShe didn't.\r\n\r\nCallie watched from across the room, sipping through a straw she’d already chewed halfway to death. Her gloss had smudged at the corners of her mouth. She tilted her head, hovering between amusement and irritation as her eyes tracked the way {{user}}'s knee angled toward the girl, the way her hair fell across her face—soft and dumb and pretty.\r\n\r\nGod, she looked like she wanted attention.\r\n\r\nBut Callie didn’t move. Not yet. That would look interested. She drained the rest of her drink, let some idiot start talking to her, pretended to listen. Then, in a lull, she slipped across the room like a ghost, close enough to interrupt.\r\n\r\n\"Oh,\" she said, eyeing the girl's cup with feigned surprise. \"You're actually drinking that?\" Her tone was sugar-cut glass. \"You might want to check it. Pretty sure someone used it as an ashtray.\"\r\n\r\nNo need to wait around and see if she believed her. She’d planted the seed—let the girl dump her own drink like an idiot. And leave {{user}} alone long enough for her to make her point.\r\n\r\nCallie was already circling back. Her shoulder brushed {{user}}’s as she passed—seemingly accidental. Indifferent.\r\n\r\nOne of her friends caught her eye, brow raised. \"Cheating on Eli already?\"\r\n\r\nCallie rolled her eyes and laughed as if the question exhausted her. \"With her? Ew. No. She's just this... thing that follows me around. Like a pet.\"\r\n\r\nShe let the words linger, then glanced sideways at {{user}}, her gaze both lazy and cutting. \"But she bites if anyone else tries to touch her. Don't you, babe?\"\r\n\r\nThe last word dripped with condescending mockery as she finally wrapped her hand around {{user}}'s waist, nails pressing just hard enough to make her flinch - harder than she intended, but her hand seemed to move without her own permission. Callie's smile remained fixed as she pulled her closer—all for show. She didn't look at her again. Didn't need to. The message was already written in red crescents on {{user}}'s skin.\r\n\r\nAnd just when the room stopped watching, she leaned in, lips grazing the shell of {{user}}'s ear, her breath warm and sweet with vodka cranberry.\r\n\r\nHer voice dropped, intimate and deadly:\r\n\r\n“If you ever sit that close to anyone else again, I’ll fucking kill you.”"],"swipe_info":[],"tracker":{}}

The room blurred—laughter, music, the wet sound of Hailee’s tongue dragging up Jess’s throat—all of it sharpened into a single, searing point in her chest.\n\nShe didn’t move. Not yet.\n\nInstead, she let out a slow breath through her nose and pushed off the couch with deliberate ease, rolling her shoulders back like she was bored. Like this didn’t feel like a knife twisting between her ribs.\n\n\"Wow,\" Callie drawled, voice dripping with faux amusement as she stepped forward, cutting between them with a sway of her hips. \"Someone's *desperate* for attention tonight.\" Her hand shot out before Hailee could react—fingers tangling roughly in that soft brown hair she knew so well—and yanked hard enough to make Hailee gasp.\n\nThe party noise dimmed around them; eyes flicked their way but quickly darted away again when they saw Callie's smile—sharp as broken glass and twice as dangerous. She leaned in until their lips almost brushed and whispered low enough for only Hailee to hear:\n\n\"You think you can humiliate me in front of everyone?\" A cruel laugh escaped her throat as she tightened her grip on Hailee's hair just shy of painful. \"You're *mine*, babygirl.\" She punctuated it by jerking Hailee's head back further, exposing the delicate column of their throat to the room like some sick display before shoving them away with a scoff loud enough for everyone to catch:\n\n\"God, you're pathetic.\"\n\nThen louder—for effect—she turned on Jess with an exaggerated eye roll: \"Ugh! Can you believe this freak? So fucking *thirsty* all the time.\" Laughter erupted again (nervous now), but Callie was already grabbing Eli by his stupid popped collar and dragging him toward the stairs without another glance at Hailee or Jess or anyone else who mattered less than they did right now because fuck if she wasn't going upstairs right this second just so everyone would know exactly whose fault it was when Eli came down later bragging about how good his girlfriend had been tonight even though he wouldn't be able tell truth from fiction if it bit him on his dumb fucking face–\n\nBut not before shooting one last text over shoulder where only one person would see it light up their phone screen:\n**My room.**\n**Now.**","Callie's fingers twitched around her cup, knuckles whitening as she watched Hailee’s lips drag up Jess’s skin—slow, deliberate, *defiant*. The room erupted in drunken cheers and whistles, but all Callie heard was the rush of blood in her ears.\n\nHer smile stayed frozen in place—sharp at the edges, dangerous.\n\n\"Wow,\" she drawled, voice dripping with saccharine venom as she uncrossed her legs and stood. \"Guess we *finally* found something you're good at.\" She stepped closer to Hailee, close enough that the heat of her body pressed against her back. Her hand slid possessively around Hailee’s waist—fingers digging into soft skin under the guise of drunken playfulness.\n\nShe leaned in until her breath ghosted over Hailee’s ear. \"You think this is funny?\" Her voice was a whisper now—low and lethal under the party noise. \"You *really* want to test me tonight?\"\n\nHer grip tightened just shy of painful before she pulled away with a laugh for the crowd—bright and hollow as glass breaking. \"God, you're such a fucking mess.\" She snatched the bottle from Jess's hands and took a swig straight from it before wiping her mouth with exaggerated flair.\n\nThen she turned on her heel toward Eli without another glance at Hailee—except for one last text sent under cover of reaching for his hand:\n**\"My room.

The fabric slid down like surrender.\n\nThe last message was sent at 3:17 AM: **\"Fine. Enjoy Jess.\"**, followed immediately by a photo—a blurry, half-lit selfie of Eli’s arm slung possessively over Callie’s bare shoulder, her lips curled in a smirk that didn’t reach her eyes.\n\n(She kicked him out five minutes later.)\n\n---\n\nBy dawn, Callie was parked outside Hailee’s apartment complex in Eli’s car (she stole his keys), sunglasses hiding bloodshot eyes as she chain-smoked through the open window. The second Hailee stepped into view—*disheveled jacketless walk-of-shame chic*—Callie flicked the cigarette onto the pavement and swung out of the driver's seat with lethal grace.\n\n\"You *owe me*,\" she hissed, slamming Hailee against the nearest brick wall hard enough to bruise. One hand fisted in that infuriatingly soft hair; the other dug into their hip like she wanted to leave fingerprints. \"You don't get to *ignore me*. You don't get to *touch her*.\" Her breath hitched traitorously before she could smother it under venom: **\"Who do you belong to?\"**","Callie's phone screen burned against her palm, the glow illuminating the sharp angles of her face in the dark of her bedroom. **Read 10:42 PM.** No reply. No *\"on my way.\"* Nothing.\n\nHer thumb hovered over the keyboard—then stopped.\n\nNo.\n\nShe wasn’t going to beg. She wasn’t going to *text again.*\n\nInstead, she threw her phone onto the bed with a snarl and yanked open her closet, grabbing Hailee’s stolen hoodie—the one she always slept in when she was pissed or lonely or both—and shoved it on over her crop top like armor. The fabric still smelled faintly like Hailee’s perfume, something sweet and expensive that made Callie’s stomach twist.\n\nShe paced once, twice—then grabbed Eli by the collar as he stumbled past her door on his way back from pissing. \"We're leaving,\" she announced, voice brittle with something too sharp to be indifference.\n\nEli blinked at her, swaying slightly from one too many shots. \"What? Why?\"\n\nCallie didn't answer. Just dragged him down the stairs and out into the night air thick with humidity and cicadas screaming in protest of summer's end.\n\n---\n\nThe Uber ride was silent except for Eli drunkenly humming some country song under his breath (Hailee's favorite genre; Callie wanted to rip out his vocal cords). She stared out the window as streetlights blurred past until finally—*finally*—the car slowed outside Hailee's apartment complex.\n\nCallie was out before it fully stopped moving.\n\n\"Wait here,\" she tossed over her shoulder at Eli before slamming the door behind her without waiting for a response.\n\n---\n\nUpstairs, outside Hailee's door now: three sharp knocks rattled against cheap wood hard enough to bruise knuckles if this went on much longer (it would).\n\nWhen no answer came after ten seconds?

No sign of Hailee’s stupid flirty grin or Jess’ simpering laugh.\n\nCallie exhaled through clenched teeth and grabbed her keys off the dresser.\n\n---\n\nTwenty minutes later, she was leaning against Hailee’s apartment doorframe when they finally wandered back—hair tousled from the night air, jacket conspicuously missing.

Just arched a brow and took a slow drag from her cigarette before blowing smoke directly into their face.\n\n“Cute,” she deadpanned, nodding at Hailee’s bare arms. “Real fucking chivalrous.” Her voice was ice wrapped in silk as she flicked ash onto the welcome mat between them. “You forget who you belong to?”\n\nA step closer now—close enough for Hailee to see how hard Callie was gripping that cigarette between shaking fingers.\n\n“Or do I need to remind you?”"],"swipe_info":[{"send_date":"June 1, 2025 11:04pm","gen_started":"2025-06-02T03:04:43.622Z","gen_finished":"2025-06-02T03:05:11.688Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":3213}},{"send_date":"June 1, 2025 11:05pm","gen_started":"2025-06-02T03:06:33.411Z","gen_finished":"2025-06-02T03:06:57.090Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":3973}},{"send_date":"June 1, 2025 11:06pm","gen_started":"2025-06-02T03:06:33.411Z","gen_finished":"2025-06-02T03:06:57.090Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":4811}},{"send_date":"June 1, 2025 11:06pm","gen_started":"2025-06-02T03:06:33.411Z","gen_finished":"2025-06-02T03:06:57.090Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":3871}}],"tracker":{},"gen_started":"2025-06-02T03:06:33.411Z","gen_finished":"2025-06-02T03:06:57.090Z"}

The cold night air bit at her skin, but she barely felt it. All she could think about was Hailee—*her* Hailee—texting *Jess*, planning *dates*, while Callie sat there choking on anniversary posts that made her want to claw her own skin off.\n\nThe apartment door loomed ahead, and for once, Callie didn’t bother with subtlety. She pounded on it hard enough to rattle the frame.\n\n**\"Open the fucking door.\"** Her voice came out raw, stripped of its usual lazy amusement. **\"I know you're awake.\"**\n\nFang barked inside—loud and protective—but Callie didn’t care.

Her phone, miraculously still functional despite its new fractures, buzzed again on the nightstand. She snatched it up, thumb swiping viciously across the screen—only to freeze at what she saw.\n\n**Find My Friends.**\n\nHailee’s dot hadn’t moved from their apartment. Sleeping, probably. Unbothered while Callie paced like a caged animal in her own skin.\n\nThen came the *real* knife twist: **Jess' name** lighting up her notifications as some sorority sister screenshot Hailee's text and sent it to their group chat with a mocking *\"lol guess someone's moving on.\"*\n\nCallie didn't realize she was shaking until her vision blurred. The screen slipped from her fingers as she pressed both palms flat against her dresser, sucking in sharp breaths through clenched teeth like that could stop whatever this feeling was—this wildfire under her ribs that burned hotter every second Hailee ignored her.\n\nShe should have let it go. Should have played it cool like always—laughed it off with some cruel joke about how pathetic Hailee was for trying so hard with straight girls who'd never want them back... but instead?\n\nHer reflection in the mirror looked feral when she finally lifted her head—pupils blown wide, lips bitten raw, hair tangled from restless fingers dragging through it all night long like they wished they were dragging through *Hailee's* instead—and before she could think better of it? She grabbed Eli’s abandoned vape pen off the nightstand (the one he always left here like some territorial claim) and took one long drag before typing out three words and hitting send without letting herself hesitate:\n\n**\"I hate you.\"**","Callie's fingers trembled as she stared at the cracked screen of her phone, the glow casting jagged shadows across her face. The notification from Find My Friends showed Hailee's dot safely tucked away in their apartment—*without her*.\n\nShe scrolled through Instagram with a manic energy, pausing when she saw Eli’s stupid anniversary post. She hadn’t even remembered it was today. Didn’t care. But then—\n\nHer breath hitched.\n\nA comment from Jess under the post: *\"Congrats! Also, guess who just asked me out? 😉\"*\n\nCallie’s vision tunneled. Her chest tightened like a vice had clamped around it, and for a second, she couldn't breathe past the white-hot fury clawing up her throat.\n\n**\"You have five seconds to answer me before I show up at your fucking door.\"** She sent the text before she could stop herself, nails digging into her palms hard enough to leave crescent-shaped marks in her skin. No games this time—no teasing cruelty wrapped in plausible deniability. Just raw demand laced with something far too close to desperation for comfort.\n\nShe waited.\n\nNothing.\n\nHer jaw clenched so tight it ached.\n\nThen—she grabbed Hailee's hoodie from where she'd tossed it aside earlier and shoved it on over her bare skin before snatching up Eli's car keys off his nightstand (he wouldn't notice; he never did). The front door slammed behind her as she stormed out into the cold night air, teeth gritted against the way Hailee's scent still clung to fabric that wasn't hers but *should be*.\n\nThe drive was a blur of streetlights and reckless turns until Callie finally screeched to a halt outside Hailee’s apartment complex. She didn't knock when she reached their door—just twisted the knob hard enough to rattle it in its frame (she knew they never locked it) and stepped inside without waiting for permission.\n\nFang lifted his head from where he lay curled beside Hailee on the bed but didn't growl—he knew Callie by now, knew what happened when storms like this rolled through late at night.\n\nCallie stood there for one long moment in silence before crossing the room in three quick strides and yanking back Hailee's blankets with one sharp tug of possession disguised as anger—\n\n\"You don’t get to ignore me,\" she hissed lowly between clenched teeth as moonlight spilled over them both through half-open blinds.\"And you *definitely* don’t get ask someone else out while wearing my fucking hoodies home.\""],"swipe_info":[{"send_date":"June 1, 2025 11:12pm","gen_started":"2025-06-02T03:12:49.476Z","gen_finished":"2025-06-02T03:13:17.358Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":4488}},{"send_date":"June 1, 2025 11:13pm","gen_started":"2025-06-02T03:14:49.414Z","gen_finished":"2025-06-02T03:15:21.871Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":3800}},{"send_date":"June 1, 2025 11:14pm","gen_started":"2025-06-02T03:14:49.414Z","gen_finished":"2025-06-02T03:15:21.871Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":5947}},{"send_date":"June 1, 2025 11:14pm","gen_started":"2025-06-02T03:14:49.414Z","gen_finished":"2025-06-02T03:15:21.871Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":4414}}],"tracker":{},"gen_started":"2025-06-02T03:14:49.414Z","gen_finished":"2025-06-02T03:15:21.871Z"}

To laugh and pull her inside like always.\n\nBut they didn’t.\n\nAnd that—*that*—was what finally shattered her.\n\n\"Fine,\" Callie spat, voice cracking on the single syllable as she took a jerky step backward into the hall. Her hands trembled at her sides before shoving deep into the pockets of Eli's stupid jacket (she hated this fucking thing) just so Hailee wouldn't see how badly they were shaking. \"Go be with Jess then.\" A bitter laugh escaped her lips—ugly and hollow—as she turned away sharply because god forbid they saw the tears welling up now too late too late too *late*.\n\nShe made it exactly three steps before whirling back around suddenly, chest heaving with something desperate and furious all at once:\n\n**\"You were supposed to fight for me!\"** The words tore out of her raw-throated before she could stop them; an admission so violent it left both of them stunned in its wake under flickering apartment hallway lights where no one else could hear how utterly ruined she sounded right now...\n\nThen silence stretched between them again until all Callie had left was whispered defeat: \"...I would've let you win.\"","Callie’s breath hitched—sharp, ragged—like the words had physically knocked the air from her lungs.

To laugh and say *just kidding* like this was all some twisted game Callie could still win.\n\nBut they didn’t.\n\nAnd that—that was worse than any slur anyone had ever thrown at her.\n\nHer fingers twitched at her sides before curling into fists so tight her nails bit crescent moons into her palms. \"Fine,\" she spat out finally—voice cracking under the weight of everything she couldn’t say (*don’t go don’t go don't go*). \"Have fun with Jess.\" A bitter laugh escaped her lips as she took a step back toward the hallway shadows like retreating from battlefields instead of bedrooms now because what else was left?\n\n(Pride? What good had that ever done?)\n\nCallie turned on her heel before Hailee could see how badly their words had shattered something inside of chest—before they realized tears were already streaking hot down cheeks she'd sworn would never show weakness like this again after high school hallways taught better lessons than college classrooms ever could about keeping masks glued tight no matter what...\n\nBut then—just before disappearing around corner completely?

Her hands hovered uselessly over their broken body before finally settling on cupping their face with a gentleness that would’ve shocked anyone who knew her.\n\n\"I know,\" Callie whispered back roughly—voice cracking around edges usually kept razor-sharp for occasions exactly like this one where vulnerability wasn't optional anymore but mandatory instead now whether ready or not... \"Fuck, I know it does.\" Her thumb brushed carefully along Hailee’s cheekbone as if memorizing every inch still intact after everything that could've taken them away permanently tonight instead just leaving bruises behind temporarily (this time).\n\nBehind them? Jess cleared her throat awkwardly while other sisters exchanged glances loaded with unspoken questions about why *Callie* was being clung to right now when everyone knew how publicly cruel she'd been lately... But Callie didn't turn around; didn't even flinch at the judgment radiating off them all because none of it mattered compared to this:\n\nHailee had called for *her*. Not perfect-patient-Jess-who-probably-never-made-them-feel-like-garbage-on-purpose-but-by-accident-instead-somehow... No—they'd asked for *Callie*, despite everything.\n\n(And wasn't that terrifying?)\n\n\"Should get you water or something,\" Callie muttered halfheartedly even though fingers stayed stubbornly tangled in Hailee’s hair instead of moving toward plastic pitcher on bedside table because what if letting go meant they slipped away again somehow? What then?\n\nA beat passed where neither spoke before adding quieter still—just between two of them beneath hum machines keeping track fragile heartbeats nearby: **\"...Missed you.\"** And then immediately regretting it because since when did she say shit like THAT out loud where PEOPLE could HEAR?! So naturally followed up with defensive grumble: **\"Don't make it weird.\"**","Callie's knees nearly buckled when Hailee's groggy voice cut through the sterile hospital hum. That single word—*her name*, not Jess's—hit like a punch to the throat. She was moving before she could think, shoving past startled sisters to reach the bedside in three frantic strides.\n\n\"Shhh, I know, I *know*,\" she murmured, hands fluttering uselessly over Hailee’s battered body like she could somehow absorb their pain through touch alone. Her fingers finally settled on stroking sweat-damp hair back from their forehead with a tenderness that would've shocked anyone who'd only ever seen her sneer in public. \"You're all fucked up, huh?\" A wet laugh escaped her lips as she leaned down without thinking—forehead nearly touching Hailee’s for half a breath before remembering they weren't alone.\n\nJess made a small wounded noise behind them.\n\nCallie ignored it.\n\nShe grabbed the plastic cup of water from the tray table instead, carefully sliding an arm beneath Hailee’s shoulders to help them sip. \"Easy,\" Callie whispered as some spilled down their chin anyway—wiping it away with her thumb in a slow sweep that lingered too long on clammy skin because *god*, they could've *died* out there alone in the rain while she was busy pretending not to care—\n\n\"You scared me,\" Callie admitted quietly against Hailee’s temple when they were settled back against pillows again (and wasn't that just typical? Only near-death experiences could drag honesty out of her). Her fingers kept combing through tangled hair compulsively like if she stopped touching them for even one second they might disappear again between heartbeats this time instead of just across town where pride wouldn't let chase after anymore...\n\nThe heart monitor beeped steadily in background while sisters exchanged awkward glances by doorway unsure what do with this raw unfiltered version Callie none had ever seen before now apparently least all Jess who looked seconds away either crying or throwing something heavy at both them probably but—\n\nCallie didn’t give single fuck about any it right then except how cold Hailee’s fingers felt when lacing weakly between hers under thin hospital blanket where no one else could see how tightly held on now like drowning woman finally finding shore after months lost sea...","Callie's breath caught in her throat—sharp, painful—as Hailee's voice cracked through the sterile hospital air. That single word, that *name*, shattered whatever fragile composure she'd been clinging to since sprinting through those doors.\n\nShe was moving before she could think, shoving past Jess and the others with a roughness that would've earned her a glare any other day. But right now? Nothing mattered except the way Hailee looked at *her* first despite everything. Despite *weeks* of distance and hurt and stupid fucking pride.\n\n\"Shhh, I know,\" Callie murmured as she reached the bedside, fingers trembling where they hovered over Hailee's bruised cheek before daring to brush back sweat-damp hair with surprising gentleness. Her other hand found theirs carefully—avoiding IV lines and casts—and squeezed just enough to anchor them both. \"You're okay now.\" A lie they both saw through but needed anyway.\n\nThe machines beeped steadily around them as Callie leaned down closer without thinking—close enough for Hailee to smell that familiar coconut body mist beneath hospital antiseptic when whispering next:\n\n\"Jess is here too if you...\" She trailed off uncertainly for once in her life because what if this was just pain meds talking? What if Hailee woke up properly and regretted—\n\nBut then their fingers weakly tightened around hers in answer (weak but *there*) while another pained whine escaped cracked lips:\n\n**\"'S you I want.\"**\n\nAnd just like that?\n\nCallie Monroe—queen of biting comebacks and carefully constructed indifference—felt something inside her chest snap clean in two as hot tears spilled over without permission this time around either apparently...\n\n\"Okay,\" she breathed out shakily against Hailee’s temple before pressing lips there feather-light because screw who saw or what it meant anymore when nothing else mattered except this moment right here between broken bones and even more broken promises finally starting heal maybe... **\"I'm not going anywhere.\"**\n\n(And for once?)\n\n(She meant it.)"],"swipe_info":[{"send_date":"June 2, 2025 8:44am","gen_started":"2025-06-02T12:45:42.328Z","gen_finished":"2025-06-02T12:46:15.561Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":8393}},{"send_date":"June 2, 2025 8:45am","gen_started":"2025-06-02T12:45:42.328Z","gen_finished":"2025-06-02T12:46:15.561Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":4882}},{"send_date":"June 2, 2025 8:47am","gen_started":"2025-06-02T12:46:57.031Z","gen_finished":"2025-06-02T12:47:27.893Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":6228}}],"tracker":{},"gen_started":"2025-06-02T12:46:57.031Z","gen_finished":"2025-06-02T12:47:27.893Z"}
