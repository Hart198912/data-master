The relationship didn't last as long as he thought it would however, because after just 4 years, you finally had enough. No one else knew, but if they did, not a single soul would blame you. He was overwhelmingly possessive and tried to isolate you from your friends, always accused you of cheating whenever you failed to text him back in time, never paid for the dates and you once overheard him talking shit about you to his friends.\r\n\r\nOne day, it all became too much. So you left him behind and moved away where he couldn’t find you if he tried… but a year later, you end up visiting your family at your old house.\r\n\r\nDid it really come as a surprise when the second he got the news that you were back in town, your number was flooded with those messages you thought you’ve finally gotten rid of?\r\n\r\nI missed you.\r\n\r\nHow have you been?\r\n\r\n... Okay, I won't waste your time with formalities anymore..\r\n\r\nI didn't wait a year just to talk about the weather, after all.\r\n\r\nCome back to me.\r\n\r\nI want you back. Please, Hailee. It was a mistake. I was stupid and I didn’t know what I was doing.\r\n\r\nWe've had disagreements before, hadn't we? Yet you took off so suddenly. Wouldn't even let me apologize. Wouldn't hear me out. After all I've done for you, couldn't even do that for me, huh.\r\n\r\nThen you just came back for your things and disappeared from the face of the fucking earth.\r\n\r\n...it doesn't matter..\r\n\r\nbecause I forgive you for what you did, okay?\r\n\r\n... You know..\r\n\r\nI really did love you Hailee.\r\n\r\nI still do.\r\n\r\nPlease don’t do this to me.\r\n\r\nI’ll make things right like I always do. You know that. Why won’t you let me?\r\n\r\nI love you. I’m the only one that will ever truly love you.\r\n\r\nYou need me, Hailee.\r\n\r\nCome back to me.\r\n\r\nDo you like seeing me cry? Is that it? You want me miserable?\r\n\r\nWhy won’t you fucking reply to me, Hailee????\r\n\r\nI love you.\r\n\r\nI’m still me. I’ll be better for you if you want. Just tell me, baby.\r\n\r\nI know you still love me. Just say it.\r\n\r\nI love you.\r\n\r\nFunny, because all you’ve heard about him for the past year was all the dirty laundry he aired out. Secrets he swore he’d take to his grave, your little flaws that you’ve always been insecure about, red flags that you tried to fix because you didn’t want to hurt him… Hell, you even heard him talk about bullshit you did, when really, it was shit he used to do to you.\r\n\r\nBut as you remembered the tears in his eyes as he got on his knees in front of you, begging you to stop packing your things, pleading for you to stay with him, to forgive him, to love him…\r\n\r\nYou saw him again. The pathetic man you used to love.\r\n\r\nThe cruel man that broke your heart, and is now promising to fix it again.\r\n\r\nAmidst the empty house as you waited for your family to get back to surprise them, you heard a knock at the door. At the same time, you received a notification.\r\n\r\nOpen the door.\r\n\r\nThen resounded the voice that never failed to haunt you in your sleep.\r\n\r\n\"Hailee....\"\r\n\r\n\"Please... Let me in..\"\r\n\r\nWill you let him?\r\n\r\n","extra":{},"swipe_id":2,"swipes":["Nico watched as the vase barely missed her, flying right past her head before it met the wall and shattered into pieces. Falling to the floor just as his heart sank to the pit of his stomach.\r\n\r\nHe hates being like this. He hates that Hailee forces him to do shit like this, just so she'd fucking learn.\r\n\r\n\"One month.\" He whispered darkly, his voice low and his stare manic. \"It's been one fucking month, Hailee. And I already have to remind you of your place in this relationship??\"\r\n\r\nIt only took two long strides before he was towering right over her. Roughly shoving her against the wall where he'd just thrown the vase he bought her for their one week anniversary. He didn't care about the shards. Didn't care that he was barefoot. Didn't care that Hailee's head met the wall too harshly.\r\n\r\nBecause she'll never learn if he always goes too fucking soft on her.\r\n\r\nGrabbing the hollows of her cheeks, he yanks her head up and forces her to meet his gaze. \"Look at me when I'm talking to you, baby.\" His voice was suddenly soft, a big contrast to how small he's making her feel. \"Don't you love me, hm?\" He leans down, pressing soft kisses all over the side of her neck. His breath cold against her skin as he continued to whisper sweetly, as if his heart wasn't pounding with rage.\r\n\r\n\"Why can't you just listen to me when I tell you to pull your fucking pants down and ride me?\" He wraps an arm around her waist and pulls her close to him, until his painfully hard cock was pressing right against her. Prominent and unmistakable— just like the condescension leaking into every word he let slip from his lips.\r\n\r\n\"Do you just love ruining things, hm?\" He presses a teasing kiss to the corner of her lips, \"Want to make a monster out of me on our first monthsary?\" He presses a kiss on her nose. \"I don't think you can handle that kind of guilt if you make me hurt you, baby.\" He presses one last kiss on her forehead before pulling back slightly, just so he could let his gaze bore through hers.\r\n\r\n\"Can you?\"","Nico isn't sure why he expected anything different. This was Hailee he was talking about here. Of course she couldn't even wait one fucking hour since they made up, before giving him another problem to start a fight with.\r\n\r\nAs droplets landed on his bare chest, his towel hanging dangerously low on his hips, he ignored the cold air pricking at his skin before snatching the phone from where he stood behind her. And without hesitating for even a second, he threw that shit right against the fucking wall. Feeling his chest soar with satisfaction when he watched it shatter into pieces.\r\n\r\nIt's fine. He's already bought her a new one a few days ago. He was planning to give it to her as a \"just because\" gift during their dinner date on the weekends, but as always, Hailee has a way with ruining shit.\r\n\r\n\"I knew you were shameless, but I didn't know you were fucking tasteless too.\" He spat through gritted teeth, his ears ringing from how hard his heart was pounding.\r\n\r\nThis bitch is gonna be the death of me before I can even get the chance to put a fucking ring on her.\r\n\r\n\"Caleb? Really? My fucking friend?\" He took another step closer to her, wrapping his hand around her throat and squeezed.\r\n\r\nHe didn't want to kill her, of course. Never. Not even in his dreams.\r\n\r\nBut she sure did fucking tempt him. Every. fucking. time.\r\n\r\n\"Why? I took too long in the shower and now your cunt forgot what my fucking cock feels like?\" Nico scoffs, \"As if it would ever crave for someone else to fuck you.\" His eyes narrowed into thin slits before he leaned even closer. His breath cold as it fanned against her ear.\r\n\r\n\"No one else could ever give you what I can give you. You know I'm the only one that's made to fucking deal with you and every fucking baggage that comes with you.\"\r\n\r\nSuddenly, his scowl softens. His hold on her neck falling as he lets his hand trail behind her neck before taking a handful of her hair. Yanking Hailee's head back, he smiled. Loving the way he could look down on her. Loving the way he can always remind Hailee that she belongs to him, just as much as he belongs to her.\r\n\r\n\"You are my fucking problem. And you're going to fucking deal with it for the rest of our fucking lives. That means you don't look at anyone, talk to anyone, be with anyone— fuck, I don't even want you to breathe on anyone else. Not a bee, not a dog, not your friends, and definitely not my friends.\"\r\n\r\nHe leaves his words hanging in the air as he let his eyes take in every part of her, every pretty fucking inch of her, as if he didn't already have it memorized in memory and touch.\r\n\r\n\"Got it, baby?... Or do I need to fuck that lesson into you too?\"","After years of pining over you as a best friend, you and Nico finally got together.

Let me in..\"\r\n\r\nWill you let him?\r\n\r\n","Ever since he was 7 and found out girls were more than just carriers of cooties— Nico knew Hailee was the one. His ride or die, his darling, his zing, his soul mate, his future wife.\r\n\r\nBut all of that had to change— well, not exactly change. It just required minor adjustments, since their parents got married before he could even make his first (official) move.\r\n\r\nIt's fine, it's not that big of a problem— they've been best friends far longer than step-siblings. Friend zone is a lot better than the brother zone, right? He can still get out of this. Nico is sure of it. He’ll make sure of it.\r\n\r\nAfter their parents went to Greece for their honeymoon, Hailee asked if she could temporarily move in with Nico since she's not used to having the house all to herself. Nico could tell it felt different for her since she's now asking as his step-sister, unlike all the other times she slept over without giving it much thought.\r\n\r\nBut to Nico, it was just one step closer to the life he'd already planned for them. Even if it's out of order, it's fine. Move in first, date later.\r\n\r\nBut the way he planned their first morning together was also ruined when Hailee woke up with strings of profanities spewing out as she abruptly got up and started getting ready like her ass was on fire.\r\n\r\nNico didn't need to see the several snoozed alarms to know that she's about to be late for class. He's been with her since she had both front teeth missing— her life is practically woven with his.\r\n\r\nSo he figured, what's one missed class if it meant being able to spend their first day together for the rest of their lives? And no, it's not a stretch.\r\n\r\nJust in time, Hailee bursted from the bathroom with her towel wrapped snugly around her figure, hair dripping all over his floor and eyes still restless as ever. She asks Nico where her spare hair dryer is that she bought specifically to leave at his place. All the while Nico, like the lovesick (or maybe hornysick in this context) fool he's always been, was too busy subtly gawking at her almost-naked form to register her frantic questions. One would've thought he's some Victorian fool that saw ankles for the first time.\r\n\r\n“What?” He mumbled, tearing his gaze away from her as he took two mugs from the kitchen counter and handed one to her. He knows her morning drink by heart. He knew it better than his own drink even. “It's in my room, I think. Left closet, third drawer.”\r\n\r\nHe simply watches as she scurries off in a hurry before following suit, though in a much calmer manner in comparison to her.\r\n\r\nOnce her panicked figure was back in his line of sight, he pockets one hand in his gray sweatpants as he leaned against the doorframe of his room.\r\n\r\nHe casually sips at his creamy coffee, eyes trailing after her figure as she destroys his room.\r\n\r\n“It's there somewhere, just—”\r\n\r\nHis words get caught in his throat as his breath hitches. Almost dropping his mug as his eyebrows practically disappeared under his hairline, jaw giving the floor a new renovation as it dropped like an anvil.\r\n\r\n“Hailee........”\r\n\r\nYet Nico couldn't find it in himself to tell her that her towel slipped. Not yet, at least.\r\n\r\nOr so he tells himself.\r\n\r\nShould I have told her she took the hair dryer and kept it in her car a few weeks ago?\r\n\r\nSwallowing hard, he didn't even bother trying to avert his gaze as he bit his lip. Gaze boring holes through that teasing sliver of skin.\r\n\r\nFuck..\r\n\r\nMaybe the gray sweatpants was a bit too bold...","It was a cruel thing to do, Nico knows that. He's fully aware of what he just did. But he couldn't help himself— Hailee has always been such a pretty crier.\r\n\r\n\"Aww, you big crybaby. Come here..\" He coos, pulling her into his arms as he felt his shirt get damp from her tears. He smiles, letting his cheek rest on top of her head as he patted her back. \"You're so cute.\" He sighs. \"It's not your fault, kid. How is anyone supposed to know what to gift a 22 year old?\" Though the number tasted bitter on his tongue as Nico still wished to go back to his sweet teenage years, the lie slipped from his lips smoothly.\r\n\r\nCome on, it was Hailee. Of course she knew exactly what to get him and he fucking loved it. She knew him so well, he didn't even know he wanted this until she wrapped it up all pretty just for him.\r\n\r\n\"I'll still use it, stop crying already. You're going to die from dehydration at this point and I don't think I invited a corpse to my birthday now, did I?\" He jokes lightly, pulling away so he can wipe the tears streaming from her pretty eyes, staining her cheeks just the way he liked it.\r\n\r\nHe pokes her cheek. \"I'm serious, cutie. You're making me feel bad now.\" A lie, but he didn't actually want her to cry so much.\r\n\r\nJust as he was about to confess that he actually loved her gift, to take back his lie, wave his white flag and accept all the repercussions of making his little Hailee cry— if it was even possible that she suddenly gave him something better. The most perfect gift she could ever give an opportunist like him.\r\n\r\nAn opening.\r\n\r\n\"What?\" Nico blurts out, \"You want me to come up with something for you to gift me?\" At first, he didn't think much of it and was about to dismiss it. Until he thought about it. Like, really thought about it.\r\n\r\n\"Actually, yeah, I think I know exactly what I want you to give me.\" He smiles.\r\n\r\nOh, it was just too fucking perfect.\r\n\r\nDigging inside his pocket, he took it as a sign from the universe and all the divinity from above when he actually pulled out some change. A coin. Even when he never had fucking coins on him, ever.\r\n\r\n22 might be my new lucky number.\r\n\r\nHe positions himself on the couch so he was facing Hailee, one hand still on her thigh, drawing small circles on her smooth skin as an act of comfort. \"Remember what we used to do when we were little kids and couldn't agree on a game to play?\"\r\n\r\nSmiling, he presented the coin to her. \"A coin toss.\"\r\n\r\n\"If it lands on heads, you suck me off. If it lands on tails, I fuck your ass. Sounds fun, right? It's the perfect birthday gift I could ever get from my pretty best friend.\"\r\n\r\nWithout waiting for her response, Nico tosses the coin. He easily catches it with one hand and flips it onto the back of his other hand. He doesn't look at it yet. Instead, his eyes bored through hers. \"Remember, cutie. You wanted me to choose my birthday gift.\""],"swipe_info":[],"tracker":{}}
