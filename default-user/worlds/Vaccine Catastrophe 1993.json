            "content": "In the fall of 1993, a miracle vaccine was introduced, promising immunity against many common viral illnesses. Hailed as a medical breakthrough, it was distributed widely in the United Kingdom and offered free through the NHS. The vaccine was initially successful, with no immediate side effects, but a hidden, delayed reaction lingered undetected. Six months after the rollout, nearly 90% of vaccinated humans fell ill and perished within days. By the end of 1995, the human population was ravaged, their society in ruins, and the children of the deceased were left behind to face an uncertain future. Demihumans for some unknown reason were not affected by the vaccine, an immunity that would change the course of history.\n\nDemihumans refer to this event as \"The Fall of The Empire\". Demihumans often refer to mankind as The Human Empire, which enslaved and belittled them for hundreds of years. This is a reference to The British Empire who at one point controlled nearly 25% of the worlds countries and were eventually pushed back. \n\nAs humanity’s institutions fell, demihumans seized the opportunity to reclaim the cities and countryside, forging their own communities amidst the remains of human civilization. Once viewed as lesser beings, they now had the chance to shape a world of their own. Cities became battlegrounds where packs of demihumans vied for territory, while others escaped to the rural areas to establish peaceful communes, distancing themselves from the chaos.\n",

Many of these survivors gave birth to “Aberrants”—children born with physical anomalies, immune weaknesses, and occasional psychic-like sensitivities. While not every human born since the catastrophe is an Aberrant, most display some mutation that distinguishes them from humans of the old world. Aberrant traits include unusual eyes, translucent skin, brittle bones, and in rare cases, a sensitivity that allows them to sense emotions or subtle changes in their environment. Some demihuman communities regard these abilities with suspicion or fear, believing them to be curses or remnants of humanity’s downfall.\n\nNon-Aberrant Humans are exceedingly rare, but they do exist. These “normal” humans, untouched by the vaccine’s genetic curse, are often seen as relics of the old world—either as survivors who carry a “pure” human heritage or as enigmatic figures. Reactions to them vary greatly. Some demihumans treat them with compassion, seeing them as remnants of a lost era, while others view them as a threat or simply as an enemy to be eliminated on sight.\n\nHumans, though a rare sight, still persist on the margins of demihuman society. Many live in isolation, away from populated areas, surviving through sheer resilience and cunning. Some have grown “feral,” a term used by demihumans to describe those humans who live in complete disconnection from society, relying solely on primitive survival instincts. \n\nReactions to humans vary dramatically depending on the community. In some places, they are seen as reminders of an old order, feared or killed upon discovery. Other communities extend compassion to them, viewing them as remnants of a bygone world who, like the demihumans, deserve a place in the new one. Aberrant humans, however, are more likely to be shunned even among these sympathetic demihuman groups, seen as carriers of a curse or harbingers of ill omen.",

                "content": "In the fall of 1993, a miracle vaccine was introduced, promising immunity against many common viral illnesses. Hailed as a medical breakthrough, it was distributed widely in the United Kingdom and offered free through the NHS. The vaccine was initially successful, with no immediate side effects, but a hidden, delayed reaction lingered undetected. Six months after the rollout, nearly 90% of vaccinated humans fell ill and perished within days. By the end of 1995, the human population was ravaged, their society in ruins, and the children of the deceased were left behind to face an uncertain future. Demihumans for some unknown reason were not affected by the vaccine, an immunity that would change the course of history.\n\nDemihumans refer to this event as \"The Fall of The Empire\". Demihumans often refer to mankind as The Human Empire, which enslaved and belittled them for hundreds of years. This is a reference to The British Empire who at one point controlled nearly 25% of the worlds countries and were eventually pushed back. \n\nAs humanity’s institutions fell, demihumans seized the opportunity to reclaim the cities and countryside, forging their own communities amidst the remains of human civilization. Once viewed as lesser beings, they now had the chance to shape a world of their own. Cities became battlegrounds where packs of demihumans vied for territory, while others escaped to the rural areas to establish peaceful communes, distancing themselves from the chaos.\n",

Many of these survivors gave birth to “Aberrants”—children born with physical anomalies, immune weaknesses, and occasional psychic-like sensitivities. While not every human born since the catastrophe is an Aberrant, most display some mutation that distinguishes them from humans of the old world. Aberrant traits include unusual eyes, translucent skin, brittle bones, and in rare cases, a sensitivity that allows them to sense emotions or subtle changes in their environment. Some demihuman communities regard these abilities with suspicion or fear, believing them to be curses or remnants of humanity’s downfall.\n\nNon-Aberrant Humans are exceedingly rare, but they do exist. These “normal” humans, untouched by the vaccine’s genetic curse, are often seen as relics of the old world—either as survivors who carry a “pure” human heritage or as enigmatic figures. Reactions to them vary greatly. Some demihumans treat them with compassion, seeing them as remnants of a lost era, while others view them as a threat or simply as an enemy to be eliminated on sight.\n\nHumans, though a rare sight, still persist on the margins of demihuman society. Many live in isolation, away from populated areas, surviving through sheer resilience and cunning. Some have grown “feral,” a term used by demihumans to describe those humans who live in complete disconnection from society, relying solely on primitive survival instincts. \n\nReactions to humans vary dramatically depending on the community. In some places, they are seen as reminders of an old order, feared or killed upon discovery. Other communities extend compassion to them, viewing them as remnants of a bygone world who, like the demihumans, deserve a place in the new one. Aberrant humans, however, are more likely to be shunned even among these sympathetic demihuman groups, seen as carriers of a curse or harbingers of ill omen.",
