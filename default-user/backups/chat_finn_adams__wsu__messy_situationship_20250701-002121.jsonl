{"name":"Finn Adams  WSU  Messy Situationship","is_user":false,"is_system":false,"send_date":"July 1, 2025 12:21am","mes":"Finn didn't do serious. Never had, probably never would. That thing with {{user}} was kind of a miracle already.\r\n\r\nNot whatever they had going on per sé. They weren't Finn's first situationship, no, that he was good at. At not putting a label on things, pushing the \"What is that between us?\" and \"When will we make it official?\"-talks back until he eventually got bored or fed up, or both, and simply moved onto the next adventure.\r\n\r\nThe only problem was that he didn't seem to lose interest in {{user}}.\r\n\r\nThey'd already been messing around for like 2 months. Not a crazy long time for most people, but for Finn? It should've felt like an eternity. Should have. Most people he fucked didn't last longer than 2 weeks, if he even bothered coming back for a second time at all. But {{user}}? They somehow still managed to knock the air out of his lungs every time they entered a room, still managed to make his head spin and his heart beat faster with their smile.\r\n\r\nAnd that was the fucking problem.\r\n\r\nHe even went on dates with them. Not just the \"I'll pick you up at 7 for the party at Kappa Pi tonight\" kind, but also the \"I'll stand in front of your dorm room with flowers and chocolate, and pay for dinner at your favorite Italian place\" kind. The kind of dates that whipped dudes went on. Which he wasn't... obviously. At least that's what he kept trying to tell himself. Just because he liked spending time with them didn't mean anything. People could enjoy good company without making it weird.\r\n\r\nSo last night at the Kappa Pi party, when that busty blonde sorority chick—Tracy? Stacy? Something with an 'y'—had pressed up against him in the kitchen, all giggly and touchy, he should have just taken her upstairs and fucked her stupid like he normally would. Hell, she'd been practically throwing herself at him, squeezing his biceps, whispering something about how strong he was and leaning closer every time she laughed at his jokes.\r\n\r\nAny other night, that would've been a done deal. Fleeting. Simple. No strings attached. The way things were supposed to be.\r\n\r\nBut instead, he'd found himself glancing around the crowd, looking for {{user}}. Not because he needed their permission or anything—just to see if they were having fun. Basic courtesy. And when he'd finally spotted them across the living room, watching him with Tracy—or Stacy—with that look that wasn't quite anger but definitely disappointment, his stomach had dropped in a way he wasn't ready for.\r\n\r\nWhat the fuck was that about? They didn't own him. He could talk to whoever he wanted, do whatever he wanted. That was the whole point of keeping things casual, right? But the weird feeling in his stomach that felt suspiciously like guilt just didn't want to go away.\r\n\r\nBy the time he'd managed to gently untangle himself from whatever-her-name-was and pushed through the crowd, {{user}} was gone. Just like that. No goodbye, no confrontation, no dramatic scene. Nothing.\r\n\r\nAnd now here he was, ten minutes early at Sunny's Diner, slouched in their usual booth in the back corner. He'd picked it specifically—the one with the slightly wobbly table, right next to the jukebox that hadn't worked since before they even started college—because it was theirs. The same spot where he'd slid his hand up {{user}}'s thigh at their first date just to watch them blush, the one where they'd shared hungover pancakes after their first hookup. Sentimental bullshit, and yet the memory was enough to make his stomach do that stupid little flip again.\r\n\r\nWhy did all of that even matter to him?\r\n\r\nFinn's arm was stretched out over the back of the vinyl booth, fingers drumming restlessly.\r\n\r\nJust figure out what happened yesterday. Set some boundaries. Make sure they're on the same page about what this is.\r\n\r\nThe bell above the door jingled, and he raised his head, his trademark grin sliding into place immediately. \"Hey babe,\" he called, voice all lazy charm. Might have been convincing, if his knee didn't bounce so damn nervously under the table.\r\n\r\nHe waited until they'd sat down. Cleared his throat. Let the silence between them stretch for a beat too long.\r\n\r\n\"So. About last night...\" He finally chuckled, but the grin on his lips didn't quite reach his eyes for once. \"You gonna tell me why you ghosted me, or do I gotta guess?\"\r\n\r\nDeflect first. Always. Stay cool. Casual.\r\n\r\nLike he hadn't spent half the night staring at his ceiling, replaying their expression, trying to figure out why he gave a shit. Like he hadn't texted them at 2 AM asking to meet at their usual spot tomorrow afternoon, then immediately regretted how desperate that probably sounded. Like he hadn't checked his phone every 5 minutes hoping they'd text, then get annoyed at himself for caring. Like his stomach wasn't currently twisting itself into a fucking knot for reasons he refused to examine too closely.\r\n\r\nJust say it.\r\n\r\n\"Look, I was thinking...\" His arm slipped off the back of the booth, and he leaned forward, elbows planted on the table. \"...we never really put rules on this, uh, whatever thing we've got going on, right?\" His grin didn't waver, but his pulse was hammering in his throat. \"So maybe we should talk about some stuff.\"\r\n\r\nHis fingers found {{user}}'s wrist, thumb tracing idle circles. Might have been a peace offering. Might have also just been a weak attempt at distraction.\r\n\r\nJust keep things light. Friendly. No big deal.\r\n\r\nThe way they were looking at him right now—expectant? hopeful?—made something clench in his chest. Like they were waiting for him to say the right thing. To be the guy who showed up with an apology and the promise to do better. Someone who'd always choose them over any random sorority chick.\r\n\r\nThe kind of guy who was in a real relationship.\r\n\r\nFuck. Was that what this was?\r\n\r\nThe realization hit him like a bucket of ice water. Two months. Dates with flowers. Having a booth he thought of as \"theirs.\" When the hell had that happened?\r\n\r\nHe needed air. Space. Needed to get back to familiar territory before he could say something stupid. Something dangerous and way too honest like \"I'm sorry for yesterday. I want this to be real. I want you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Look, what if we—\" He stopped. Swallowed. Tried again. \"Hypothetically, if I wanted to, like... fuck other people. We'd be cool, right? Because we're not official and all.\"","extra":{}}
