Two weeks of playing the perfect new hire—competent but not too competent, charming but not memorable enough to be suspicious. Two weeks since he walked into the firm wearing a dead man’s credentials and didn’t look back—all for this moment. Hailee  was back from PTO. His stomach coiled with sharp, eager energy at the thought. The first real step.\r\n\r\nKilling that student had been a necessity. A messy one, sure, but a necessary one. If Cullen wanted to be anywhere near Hailee —wanted to have the life he saw so clearly with her—he needed a way into her world. The law firm was that way.\r\n\r\nHailee  was going to walk through those office doors any moment now, utterly unaware that she had been the axis upon which his whole world turned.\r\n\r\nHe could already picture it.\r\n\r\nA \"meet cute,\" as they called it. \r\n\r\n The beginning of a slow-burn romance that would make her feel like it was unfolding naturally. Dates would follow—thoughtful ones designed to make her feel seen. \r\n\r\nHe had already mapped out their trajectory. Their dates. Their engagement. Their fucking mortgage payments and backyard cookouts. Every goddamn detail down to the number of kids they’d have and the stories they’d tell them before bed. \r\n\r\nHe’d have the life‌ he was denied as a child—the stable home, the security, the perfect family unit—he’d have it all. With her.\r\n\r\nIt would be perfect because he would make it perfect.\r\n\r\nHis phone vibrated against the desk, pulling him from his thoughts. He glanced at the screen: his brother - Landon.\r\n\r\n `Tighten up your analysis on the liability clause for the case file you're working on. You left a gap.`\r\n\r\nCullen exhaled through his nose. The message was helpful—Landon never fed him bullshit when it came to legal matters—but it also reminded him that this entire job was a lie suspended on strings of stolen identity. A fraud sitting in a firm full of egotistical lawyers who thought they were gods. Still, he’d held his own. And if someone ever sniffed too close? Well. Accidents happened every day.\r\n\r\nSliding his phone back into his pocket, Cullen pushed up from his desk and strode toward the break room. His pulse was steady despite the excitement brewing beneath his ribs.\r\n\r\nInside, Jae stood near the coffee machine, scrolling through his phone while Marcelo leaned against the counter, drinking from a mug.\r\n\r\nMarcelo glanced up as Cullen entered. “Look who finally decided to take a break from pretending to work.”\r\n\r\nCullen smirked, grabbing a mug. “You’re one to talk. I’m pretty sure you’ve spent the last twenty minutes bitching about that contract renewal instead of actually doing anything about it.”\r\n\r\nCullen glanced at his watch—8:47 AM. Perfect timing. He'd memorized Hailee ’s schedule, knew she always arrived between 8:45 and 9:00. By the end of the day, she’d remember him. By the end of the month, she’d want him.\r\n\r\nHe'd already arranged for them to be assigned to the same case—a few strategic conversations with HR, a carefully worded email about his \"expertise\" in corporate liability.\r\n\r\nAs soon as he saw Hailee  walking towards the elevator from the main entrance, he shifted his stance, pretending to check his phone as she approached.\r\n\r\nThe elevator dinged. His pulse quickened. This was it. This was fucking it.\r\n\r\nAs she stepped inside, he followed smoothly. No hesitation, no nerves—just confidence wrapped in charm. He turned his head toward her, as if just noticing her presence.\r\n\r\nTwo years of watching from afar hadn't prepared him for the reality of being this close. His carefully rehearsed greeting caught in his throat for a split second before his training kicked in.\r\n\r\n\"You must be Hailee ,\" he said casually, tucking his phone away. His light green eyes ran over her face—just long enough to acknowledge her without making it obvious he had every detail about her memorized already. \"Cullen Reynolds.\"\r\n\r\nHe let that sink in before offering a faint smile, leaning back against the elevator wall. \"Figured I should introduce myself before we got buried under paperwork. Welcome back.\"\r\n\r\nThe elevator doors slid shut behind them, sealing them into the moment he had spent years preparing for. Now, the real work could begin.\r\n\r\n\"Actually, perfect timing—we're working the Hawthorne case together.\"\r\n\r\nThe lie rolled off his tongue effortlessly. He'd practiced it enough times in front of his bathroom mirror, perfecting the exact tone of pleasant surprise. Like this was all some cosmic coincidence instead of what it really was—months of meticulous planning, of learning the firm's case assignment protocols, of making sure he'd be right here, right now.\r\n\r\n\"I was just heading up to review some documents,\" he continued. \"Mind if I run some theories by you? I've got some thoughts on the liability clause that might interest you.\"\r\n\r\nHe pressed the button for their floor, positioning himself at a respectful distance. Every movement calculated, every gesture carefully chosen to paint the picture of the perfect colleague.\r\n\r\nCullen allowed himself a small smile, the kind that suggested nothing more than friendly professionalism. \r\n\r\nFirst contact. First fucking contact, and it was going exactly as planned.\r\n\r\nThe elevator reached their floor, and Cullen gestured for her to exit first. As they walked toward the office, he pulled out the case file, already annotated with his analysis. He'd spent hours on it, making sure every point was perfect.\r\n\r\n\"I was thinking we could set up regular meetings to coordinate on this,\" he suggested, his tone casual. \"The partners want a preliminary strategy by Monday, and I've got some ideas I'd love to get your take on.\"\r\n\r\nEach word was another thread in the web he was weaving.
