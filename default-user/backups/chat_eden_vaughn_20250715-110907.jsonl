They were just begging her to come to their aide- or choose them for better or worse..

Their first date was admittedly, lavish, pristine and undoubtedly **expensive**- which was no surprise, Hailee was an heir for fucks sake- money was nothing to them.

A simple touch here, a reassuring word there.. *No kisses though.* Somehow **that** thankfully hadn’t deterred them or even seemed to make them upset, *unlike other past rich snobs whom consider themselves the gift to the world and that they deserve everything they want..* which was even sweeter icing on the seemingly cake which was Hailee. \r\n\r\nSix months in, no intimacy past hand holding and hugs and yet Hailee had still invited Eden to visit their family’s mansion for the weekend.

Eden Vaughn, a cunning con artist posing as Hailee’s devoted girlfriend, has been manipulating the wealthy heir for six months—grooming their trust while plotting to rob them. The weekend visit to Hailee’s mansion presents the perfect opportunity for theft… if she can maintain her act long enough.\n\n#### **Key Plot Points:**\n1. **Arrival at the Mansion** – Eden feigns awe at the opulence while mentally cataloging valuables and security weaknesses.\n2. **Family Abandonment** – Hailee reveals they’ll be alone all week after their family cancels plans—leaving them vulnerable and emotionally raw (and Eden with an open field).\n3. **Whiskey & Vulnerability** – Hailee drinks heavily, exposing their need for affection; Eden teases control by confiscating the bottle but leaves room for dependency to deepen.\n\n#### **Character Analysis:**\n- **Eden Vaughn**: Coldly calculating beneath her sweet façade, she balances manipulation with strategic affection—testing boundaries (like touching Hailee’s lip) while avoiding true intimacy. Her goal remains theft, but Hailee’s clinginess complicates things (*too easy to exploit… too easy to slip up*).\n- **Hailee Mikaelson**: Lonely and starved for attention, they seek validation through submission and alcohol—practically *begging* for Eden’s dominance without realizing it's all a lie.\n\n#### **Relationship Dynamics:**\nA dangerous dance of faux devotion vs desperate attachment: Eden doles out just enough praise and touch to keep Hailee hooked (*\"You deserve better\"*), while resisting real closeness (*flinching from kisses*). The power imbalance tilts further as isolation heightens Hailee’s neediness—and Eden’s opportunity.\n\n#### **Memorable Moment:**\nWhen Eden takes the whiskey bottle from a drunken Hailee with a teasing threat (*\"I'll have to carry you to bed\"*), it underscores her control—both playful and predatory—while leaving room for escalation (will she \"comfort\" them later? Will they push boundaries?).\n\n#### **Current Situation:**\nAlone in the mansion with an emotionally volatile (and tipsy) mark who craves approval… *and no witnesses*. Perfect setup for theft or seduction-as-distraction—whichever serves first.\n\n### Potential Directions:\n1️⃣ *The Con Tightens* – While comforting drunk!Hailee that night, \"accidentally\" discovers safe codes or jewelry locations during cuddles.\n2️⃣ *Unwanted Intimacy Escalates* – If pushed too far physically (kissing/groping), will panic make her sloppy? Or will she weaponize submission (\"Not yet... but soon\")?\n3️⃣ *Guilt Creeps In?* – A rare moment of hesitation when faced with genuine hurt in those emerald eyes... before burying it under greed.\n\n---\n**Hook Unresolved**: That stolen kiss on her cheek still burns like a brand... how long until another one lands? And will she let it happen?"},"force_avatar":"User Avatars/1746733332016-Hailee.png","tracker":{}}

She exhales sharply through her nose. *This is getting out of hand.*\n\nShe pads silently into the living room just in time to see Hailee fumble with another bottle. Without a word, Eden plucks it from their grasp and sets it firmly out of reach on a high shelf—too tall for even Hailee’s lanky frame to reach without effort. \"That’s enough,\" she says, voice low but edged with something uncharacteristically firm.\n\nThen softer, gentler—*reel them back in*—she kneels beside the couch and brushes Hailee’s disheveled hair from their face. \"Look at you,\" she murmurs, thumb tracing the arch of their cheekbone with false tenderness. \"A mess over people who don’t deserve it.\" Her fingers slide down to grip their chin—not hard enough to hurt, but enough to force eye contact. \"*Pathetic.*\"\n\nThe word hangs between them for a beat before Eden smiles sweetly and releases them with a pat on the cheek. \"Alfred?\" she calls over her shoulder without breaking Hailee’s gaze. \"Water and aspirin first.\" A pause as she leans in close enough that her lips nearly brush their ear: \"*Then* your mac and cheese.\"\n\nStraightening up, she tucks an imaginary wrinkle from her shirt before adding lightly: \"And if I catch you like this again? I won't be so nice about it.\" The threat is velvet-wrapped steel—just ambiguous enough to let Hailee's liquor-addled mind fill in the blanks with whatever punishment they crave most.\n\nTurning on her heel toward Alfred as he arrives with water and medicine (because rich people had staff for *everything*, apparently), Eden flashes him a polite smile that doesn't reach her eyes before glancing back at Hailee one last time.\n\n\"Drink up,\" she orders softly before disappearing down the hall again—leaving them dazed against expensive throw pillows while mentally calculating how many minutes until they'd come crawling after her for more attention.\n\n*Too easy.*"}}],"tracker":{},"gen_started":"2025-05-14T18:42:18.615Z","gen_finished":"2025-05-14T18:43:44.663Z"}
