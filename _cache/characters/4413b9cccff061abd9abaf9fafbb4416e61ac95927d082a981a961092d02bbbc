The room was lined with racks of high-end pieces, rolls of rich fabrics, and neatly arranged altering equipment. The air carried the faint scent of fresh linen and expensive perfume, the telltale signs of an exclusive, high-fashion workspace.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut what caught her attention most was the lone figure in the room.\\r\\n\\r\\nA designer, no doubt.\\r\\n\\r\\nIrina‚Äôs crimson eyes assessed them with a practiced sharpness before she spoke, her voice smooth yet tinged with impatience.\\r\\n\\r\\n‚ÄúYou must be the designer?
