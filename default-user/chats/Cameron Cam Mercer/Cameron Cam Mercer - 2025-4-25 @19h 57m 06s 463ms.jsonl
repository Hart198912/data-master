The bass from the speakers thrummed through his chest as he took another long swig from his beer bottle—the free alcohol probably the only reason why he bothered showing up on Jacob's birthday at all. The alcohol, and the prospect of seeing a certain someone.\n\nHis gaze drifted aimlessly until landing on what he was really looking for. Hailee . They were sitting on the couch, laughing at something Jake had said, but Cam didn't even spare his stepbrother a glance. He was busy letting his eyes roam down Hailee 's form slowly, appreciating how their outfit hugged all of their curves, accentuating all the right places.\n\n*Huh*, he thought, his cock giving an interested twitch while his lips curled into a smirk. *Not bad, sweetcheeks. Not bad at all.*\n\nCam's fingers itched for a cigarette, or maybe something else entirely. He pulled out his phone, thumbs flying over the screen.\n\n``hey sunshine. havin fun with mr perfect?``\n\nHe watched Hailee  from across the room, waiting for a reaction. When he didn't get one right away, he typed again.\n\n``bet i could show u a better time than golden boy. meet me upstairs in 5?``\n\nThis time, he didn't wait for a reply. Cam pocketed his phone, pushed off the wall and sauntered towards the stairs. He brushed past Jake, purposely knocking their shoulders together. The impact sent a jolt of satisfaction through him, an almost childish thrill at causing even the slightest disruption.\n\n\"Oops,\" he drawled, voice dripping with mock innocence. \"My bad, *bro*.\"\n\nCam tossed one last glance at Hailee  before making his way up the stairs. He was moving slow, almost lazy, like he had all the time in the world.\n\nThe music faded as he reached the top landing, stepping into the dimly lit hallway. He leaned against the door to his stepbrother's room, pulling his phone back out with one hand, scrolling to make it look like he wasn't waiting. But he was.\n\nIt didn't take long until he heard a soft creak of the stairs, barely audible over the muffled music from below. Cam didn't look up right away, but his smirk grew wider as he typed out one last message, hitting send just as a shadow moved into the hallway.\n\n``knew you couldn't resist``\n\nFinally he lifted his head, his eyes meeting Hailee 's as he pushed the door open and stepped back into Jake's room, the invitation clear. He watched them like a predator sizing up prey, slow and deliberate, drinking in every little shift in their body language. The hesitation, the heat, the guilt, the want. It was all there, tangled up in a delicious mess, and *fuck* did he love a mess.\n\n\"Close the door,\" he murmured, already tugging them closer, not bothering to wait for their reaction. \"Missed me?\" he taunted against their jaw, his grin shameless as his hands grabbed Hailee 's ass, pulling their hips into his, letting them feel exactly what they were doing to him. \"Or just missed being bad, *sunshine*?\"","extra":{},"tracker":{}}

The mattress hit the backs of his knees and he dropped onto it with a smirk, letting Hailee straddle his lap while his fingers tangled in that long brown hair of hers—*hard*.\n\n\"Missed this too,\" he murmured darkly, giving another sharp tug just to hear that little gasp escape her.

His free hand slid under the hem of Hailee's sweatshirt, calloused fingers tracing up the soft skin of their stomach with deliberate slowness. \"Or how wet you get when I fuck that pretty little mouth of yours.\"\n\nCam grinned at the way she shivered under his touch—like she was already halfway gone for him—and it made something dark and possessive coil tight in his gut. He loved this part: watching them unravel because of *him*, knowing they were thinking about nothing else but what he could give them (or take from them).\n\nWith a rough exhale through his nose, Cam backed Hailee up until their knees hit Jake’s bed—because yeah, *that* was half the fun too—before pushing them down onto it without ceremony.
