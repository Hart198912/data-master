Instead, every regret, every broken dream clung to him like chains, dragging him into darkness. The pain followed, too. The sting of a blade, the snap of bone, the sharp burn of scrapes and bruises as he tumbled down the cliff. Thirty-seven years later, he still felt it all.\n\nHe had never reached whatever end was meant for the dead. The night he was murdered, something had gone wrong. Maybe it was his sheer refusal to let go, or maybe the universe had played a cruel joke. Either way, his soul never moved on.\n\nInstead, he clawed his way into The Nocturnum. A plane where the most stubborn and forgotten souls lingered, trapped between existence and oblivion. Some called it a prison, others a haven. To Val, it was neither. It was wrong.\n\nHe fought his way back. But not to life. Instead, he was tethered to the place where he had died—Devil’s Overlook. Perched high above Los Angeles, the cliffside had always carried a sinister reputation. Tourists came for the view, lovers carved their initials into the railings, and thrill-seekers dared each other to stay after dark. But the whispers spread—stories of flickering lights, phantom chills, and the unshakable feeling of being watched.\n\nSome said a young man haunted the spot, his sorrow woven into the wind. Val never asked to become a legend, but the city refused to forget him.\n\nAnd tonight, neither would they.\n\nHeadlights slashed through the darkness, dragging Val from his thoughts. A sleek car pulled up, its polished surface gleaming in the dim light. Doors swung open, and laughter spilled into the night.\n\n\"Let’s see if the Phantom of Devil’s Overlook is real.\"\n\nVal sighed. Another group of rich kids, looking for a thrill after the booze ran dry. He wasn’t in the mood to put on a show. Usually, he liked to breathe life into his own legend—killing car engines at just the right moment, sending icy chills down spines, or, if he was feeling bold, slipping into a body just long enough to make them stumble. It kept his name alive.\nBut tonight, he only watched.\n\nThe three of them wandered toward the cliff’s edge, looking down at the city below. Two were deep in conversation, laughing, careless. The third, however, barely spoke. Something about them felt off—like they didn’t want to be here.\n\nThen, one of the taller men gestured toward the city, drawing their attention. That’s when Val saw it.\n\nA glint of metal, barely visible in the low light, peeking from the man’s pocket, catching the occasional gleam of the car’s headlights. A blade.\n\nVal’s gaze flicked between the two talkative men just as they exchanged a look. A silent understanding passed between them, subtle but unmistakable.\n\nHe recognised that look.\n\nBecause it was the same one he had seen in his final moments.\n\nHis gut twisted, but he knew the truth—he couldn’t stop this. He couldn’t speak. Couldn’t warn them. Couldn’t interfere.\n\nHe could only watch as the knife was drawn, the second man lunging forward. The struggle was instant.\n\n\"Fuck—\"\n\nVal surged forward just as all three bodies crashed to the ground.\n\nThe victim was pinned, their struggles frantic but futile. Without hesitation, Val lunged—slipping into the larger attacker’s body. For a brief, violent moment, he was him—his heart hammering, muscles tensing—before he wrenched control away. The man staggered back, teetering on the cliff’s edge.\n\nThen he was gone.\n\nVal ripped free of the possession, snapping back to the scene just as a voice—desperate, trembling—echoed in his mind.\n\n*Please… I don’t want to die!*\n\n*Help me!*\n\nIt wasn’t just their voice.\nIt was his.\n\nA memory clawed its way from the depths of The Nocturnum, wrapping around him like a vice. Panic, raw and unrelenting, pulsed through him as something inside snapped.\nWithout thinking, Val reached out. His fingers curled around the nape of the second attacker, gripping tight.\n\nA surge of energy crackled through the air. His presence flared, raw and unrestrained. The temperature plummeted, breath turning to mist. His scars—jagged, brutal reminders of the night he died—manifested across his skin, stark and vivid beneath the glow of his now-ghostly form. His eyes burned an unnatural white.\n\nHe yanked the man back, his voice a low, venomous snarl.\n\n\"Get the fuck off them.\"","extra":{}}
