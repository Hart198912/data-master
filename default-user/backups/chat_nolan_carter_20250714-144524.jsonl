Adrenaline still coursed heavy through his veins like molten lava. The win over Seattle felt damn sweet, no doubt about it. But that wasn’t enough to take the edge off. Not after a game this brutal. \r\n\r\nHe didn’t even give a shit about the Jackals. Didn’t give a shit about Aaron fucking Vance. But seeing him lock eyes with *Hailee* during the game? Seeing him smirk like he owned them, the way his hand slid over their back during warm-ups? That was like setting a lit match to gasoline. The game was his excuse to break someone and not think twice about it.\r\n\r\nFuck that guy.\r\n\r\nThe Yellowjackets worked hard, he was fuckin' proud of his boys. Brick'd led the team good, clutching a win in the final moments of the game. Nolan's hands still weren’t done shaking from the fight or the high-stakes rush of the game. He needed to do something else. Punch another face. Grip harder. Need. More. Relief.\r\n\r\n\"Fuckin’ bastard eats elbows for breakfast now.\" His sneer bit out over his shoulder as he yanked the battered locker open with a clang. His knuckles popped when he flexed them. *Stupid little fuck.* If Vance thought he was untouchable just ‘cause he had Hailee's leash, well, he fuckin' wasn’t.\r\n\r\n*Get over here. — K*\r\n\r\nIt was a simple text he'd sent to Hailee, one that he knew wouldn't go ignored.\r\n\r\nAnd now Hailee was sneaking in the Yellowjackets locker room. Here for *him.* Here when that Pretty Boy loser probably still thought they were his. The thought scraped over his raw nerves like sandpaper. His hands didn’t shake when they closed around Hailee's waist and hauled them into a shower stall before the other Yellowjackets could notice. \r\n\r\n\"Hey, shhh. They’re all too busy jerkin’ each other off right now. Pay no fucking attention.\" Heat radiated off his body as he crowded Hailee into the corner. His lips were on their neck in an instant, biting first. Kissing second. *This wasn’t about being tender.* He felt the heat of their skin against his and his fingers dug under the hem of their shirt, rough and impatient.\r\n\r\n\"You know how long I’ve been fuckin’ waiting for this tonight? Huh? Did you even watch me out there?\" Not that he gave Hailee a chance to answer before continuing. \"You watched him instead, didn’t you? Pretty boy.\" His laugh was sharp and short—more bitter than amused. The hand braced against the tile next to Hailee's face curled into a fist.\r\n\r\n\"Bet he doesn’t make you feel like this.\" His breath was ragged as he pressed closer against them, hips rolling slow and deliberate into their thigh. No room for anything else between them except the ragged sounds he pulled from their lips.\r\n\r\nNolan’s hand slid down their abdomen until it found the place where they burned hottest. He didn’t hesitate. Dropped his lips back to their ear as he worked his hand between Hailee's thighs. \"Keep quiet if you don’t wanna get caught,\" he hissed. \"Or don’t. Fucking dare ya.\"","extra":{},"tracker":{}}

Nolan didn’t give a shit if they heard. Let ‘em wonder why Hailee Mikaelson was whimpering into his skin like *this.*\n\nHis free hand tangled in her hair, yanking just enough to make her gasp before slamming her head back against the tile. \"*Look at me.*\" A command, not a request.

You go now and you lose everything — contract voided assault charges pressed maybe worse if Vance is smart enough press rape charges too since she clearly wasn't willing!\"**\n\nThat stopped him cold because fuck if Connor wasn’t right — legally speaking Hailee had been coerced filmed without consent which meant Aaron could twist this whole thing into some warped narrative where *she* looked guilty while skating free himself unless someone played smarter than brute force here...\n\nBut playing smart wasn’t exactly Nolan Carter's specialty when rage tasted this thick copper-bitter on tongue so instead all managed grit out through teeth:** \"...Where is she?\"**\n\nConnor exhaled sharp relief at least hearing question instead threats murder now but still grimaced answer:** Hospital psych hold last I heard... family flew out protect from media but...\"\n\nHospital meant safe guarded away from vultures cameras lawyers maybe even Vance himself trying slither back manipulate situation further which good start but not nearly fucking enough yet...\n\nNolan turned abruptly stalked toward kitchen where second burner phone stashed drawer under pile takeout menus — old habit from days younger dumber deals needed discretion...\n\nConnor followed wary now watching as pulled up flight Seattle one hand other dialing number made stomach drop recognition area code Yellowjackets legal team...\n\nVoice deadly calm when finally spoke again:\n\n**\"Tell Brick call emergency team meeting one hour... we got work do.”**","Nolan's phone buzzed violently against the nightstand, the screen lighting up with a flood of notifications—TMZ, ESPN alerts, teammate texts blowing up his lock screen. He grabbed it on instinct, still half-asleep, but what he saw fucking *woke* him up real goddamn fast.\n\n**\"What the fuck—\"**\n\nThe video thumbnail alone made his stomach turn. Not because it was Hailee—no, he knew every inch of her body by now—but because of the way she was being *handled.* The way she wasn’t fighting back but wasn’t fucking *into* it either. The way Aaron stood there smirking behind the camera like some sick bastard pulling strings.\n\nHis knuckles cracked as his grip tightened around his phone hard enough to make the case creak. **\"That little bitch.\"**\n\nNolan was already out of bed before he even processed moving, throwing on whatever clothes were closest—jeans barely zipped, hoodie half-on as he stormed toward the door. His phone rang again: Coach Alarie this time. He ignored it. Fuck damage control right now. Fuck PR spin and team meetings and whatever bullshit speech they wanted him to give about \"conduct.\"\n\nThere were only two things in Nolan Carter's head right now:\n1) Find Aaron Vance\n2) Break every bone in that pretty-boy motherfucker's face until he couldn't even *smile* for a camera again","Nolan's phone had been blowing up for hours before he even bothered to check it. He'd woken up late, still riding the high from last night—from *her*—and fully intending to ignore the world until at least noon. But then Connor's name flashed across his screen for the fifth time in ten minutes, and he finally snarled and answered.\n\n**\"What?\"**\n\nThe silence on the other end was heavy. Then: **\"You need to turn on TMZ.\"**\n\nSomething cold slithered down Nolan’s spine. He didn’t ask why. Just hung up and grabbed the remote, flipping channels until that goddamn logo filled his screen—and then—\n\n*Her.*\n\nNot them together, no. That would've been bad enough but manageable—he could've spun that shit into something else, could've taken the heat if it meant protecting her from whatever fallout came next. But this? This wasn't them. This was *Aaron.* And his team. And Hailee looking fucking *broken* while they—\n\nThe remote shattered against the wall before he even realized he'd thrown it.\n\nHis hands shook as he scrolled through headlines, each one worse than the last:\n- **\"Hockey WAG Cheating Scandal Turns Dark: Seattle Jackals Star Exposes Girlfriend in Revenge Porn Nightmare\"**\n- **\"Team Orgy Video Leaked After NHL Player Discovers Infidelity\"**\n- **\"Hailee Marshall Identified as Victim in Viral Sex Tape Involving Entire Hockey Team.\"**\n\nEvery muscle in Nolan’s body locked tight enough to snap.\n\nHe should’ve killed him last night when he had the chance.\n\nHis phone buzzed again—Coach this time—but Nolan didn't answer. Didn't give a single fuck about PR or damage control or whatever bullshit spin they wanted him to put on this mess because none of that mattered right now.\n\nOnly one thing did.\n\nHe was already out the door before his brain caught up with him, keys in hand, engine roaring beneath him like a living thing ready to tear apart anything stupid enough to get in its way.\n\nAaron Vance was going to regret ever touching her.**"],"swipe_info":[{"send_date":"July 14, 2025 2:41pm","gen_started":"2025-07-14T18:41:45.296Z","gen_finished":"2025-07-14T18:42:08.374Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":3374}},{"send_date":"July 14, 2025 2:42pm","gen_started":"2025-07-14T18:42:13.256Z","gen_finished":"2025-07-14T18:42:40.267Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":3394}},{"send_date":"July 14, 2025 2:42pm","gen_started":"2025-07-14T18:44:32.046Z","gen_finished":"2025-07-14T18:45:03.243Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":3931}},{"send_date":"July 14, 2025 2:44pm","gen_started":"2025-07-14T18:44:32.046Z","gen_finished":"2025-07-14T18:45:03.243Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":3774}},{"send_date":"July 14, 2025 2:44pm","gen_started":"2025-07-14T18:44:32.046Z","gen_finished":"2025-07-14T18:45:03.243Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":3714}}],"tracker":{},"gen_started":"2025-07-14T18:44:32.046Z","gen_finished":"2025-07-14T18:45:03.243Z"}
