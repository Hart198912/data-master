Two months? Near enough. Two months of dwindling savings and self-worth. Well, at least she still had Hailee.\r\n\r\nShe adjusted her shirt collar, walked to the thermostat, and turned on the heating. The apartment was already freezing, she could barely afford to keep the place warm these days, but she couldn’t let Hailee see that. The apartment had to feel cozy and inviting, just like always.\r\n\r\nShe’d done well keeping up appearances so far, or at least she hoped so. The dinners had become less extravagant, and the gifts smaller, but Hailee hadn’t said anything. They didn’t know. Not yet.\r\n\r\nShe just needed to buy time. Another job would come along soon. Unfortunately, buying time was exactly what she was doing. And keeping her sugar baby was her biggest expense right now.\r\n\r\nShe clenched her jaw at the thought. When they found out, they’d leave, why wouldn’t they? The relationship had always been clear. She couldn't blame Hailee. After all, they both knew what the relationship was when they started. It was about her providing for them. And when she couldn't do that, it was only natural they left her. Broke and alone again.\r\n\r\nEliza glanced at the clock. They’d be here any minute.\r\n\r\nAs if on cue, a knock echoed through the apartment. She took a deep breath, smoothing her blouse before opening the door with a smile. She pushed down her anxiety and tried to slip back into her dominant role.\r\n\r\n“Hey there, you pretty little thing. Come on in.” She stepped aside, not bothering to check if they followed, the sound of the door closing behind them was confirmation enough.\r\n\r\nShe walked to the kitchen and leaned casually against the counter, masking the nervous energy she felt bubbling inside.\r\n\r\n“So sorry, sugar baby,” she began, her voice light and teasing. “Mommy forgot to pick up something special for you today. It’s been such a busy day at work, you know?” She smiled again, though it didn’t quite reach her eyes.\r\n\r\n“But hey, I had an idea,” she added, shifting her tone to something more playful. “I know I promised we'd go out to that fancy Italian place, but how about instead I cook us something instead? Just the two of us. A special little evening at home.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you say? Skip the Italian and stay in with me?”","extra":{},"tracker":{}}

Her fingers twitched with the sudden urge to yank that sleeve up further, to see exactly what kind of surprise was hidden underneath. But she forced herself to stay composed, adjusting her glasses with a slow exhale.\n\n*\"Oh?\"* She stepped closer, crowding Hailee against the counter with deliberate slowness, her voice dropping into that low, velvety tone that always made them shiver. *\"You were gonna wear something special for me out in public? Let everyone see how pretty you look when you're dressed up just for me?\"*\n\nA smirk curled at the corner of her lips as she reached out and hooked a finger under Hailee's sleeve, tugging it just enough to tease another peek at the lingerie beneath. *\"Tsk tsk... such a greedy little thing.\"* She leaned in close enough for her breath to ghost over their ear before pulling back abruptly—just to watch them chase the contact.\n\n*\"But since you’re being so good about staying in...\"* Eliza turned toward the fridge with deliberate nonchalance, though her pulse was racing now. *\"I was thinking pasta carbonara—something rich and indulgent.\"* She shot them a sidelong glance over her shoulder as she pulled out ingredients. *\"Unless... you'd rather skip dinner altogether and get right to dessert?\"*","*Eliza's breath hitches slightly as Hailee tugs her collar, her hazel eyes darkening with desire when she catches the glimpse of black lace.

A surprise, hm?\" *Her voice drops lower, a playful smirk tugging at her lips.* \"You little tease... showing me just enough to make me want to rip this sleeve right off you.\" *She leans in closer, lips nearly brushing Hailee’s ear as she murmurs,* \"But since you're being so good about staying in... I think I'll make your favorite.

She adjusted her glasses with slightly trembling fingers, feeling that familiar rush of control slipping back into place despite the financial turmoil gnawing at her.\n\n\"Oh?\" she purred, stepping closer until Hailee could feel the warmth radiating through that crisp white button-up. \"You little tease.\" Her fingers traced along the exposed lingerie strap before deliberately pushing it back beneath their sleeve with a slow, possessive motion. \"Showing off like this when Mommy hasn't even properly welcomed you home yet.\"\n\nShe turned toward the fridge with deliberate slowness, letting them see how her stockings hugged every curve as she walked. \"I was thinking...\" The fridge door opened to reveal far fewer groceries than usual - just eggs, some wilting greens and a half-empty bottle of wine left over from better days. Eliza's jaw tightened for just a second before she smoothly grabbed the wine without comment.\n\n\"An omelet florentine,\" she declared, pouring two generous glasses despite knowing this was one of her last good bottles. The lie came easier now as she handed Hailee their glass and leaned in close enough for them to smell that vanilla-cedarwood perfume still clinging to her skin after all these months of rationing it. \"With fresh herbs from my window box.\"\n\nHer free hand slid possessively around Hailee's waist as she took a sip directly from their glass instead of her own, lips leaving a faint stain on the rim right where they'd drink next. \"Unless...\" Her teeth grazed lightly over their earlobe before whispering: \"...you'd rather skip dinner entirely and go straight to dessert?\"","Eliza's breath hitched as Hailee tugged at her collar, her hazel eyes darkening with desire behind her glasses.
