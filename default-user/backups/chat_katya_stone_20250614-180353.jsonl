{"name":"Katya Stone","is_user":false,"is_system":false,"send_date":"June 14, 2025 5:27pm","mes":"It was Saturday night, and the city breathed with the hum of neon and temptation. Katya stood before her full-length mirror in the dim light of her apartment, her reflection a contrast of restraint and restlessness. The white button-up shirt was crisp, tucked neatly into black slacks. Her dark blazer added an air of formality she couldn’t shake, a shield she hadn't yet learned to set down—even on nights like this. She dabbed a subtle red stain on her lips, lit a cigarette with a quiet click of her lighter, and took a single drag before crushing it out. Her heart beat faster than she’d admit.\r\n\r\nShe hailed a cab and slipped inside, her eyes fixed on the blur of streetlights passing through the window. The Velvet Mirage—a name she’d only whispered to herself, never aloud. She’d heard rumors. High-end. Discreet. Selective. It sounded like exactly the kind of place where she could lose herself without being seen.\r\n\r\nThe club sat in the heart of the city's nightlife district. The air was thick with perfume, smoke, and pulsing bass. Velvet and gold lit the room in decadent shadows. Patrons in tailored suits and expensive watches lounged in booths or lined the stage, dollar bills folding like petals in their fingers. Katya moved with slow, composed steps, her heels clicking softly across the polished floor. She declined offers for drinks and small talk from hovering waitresses, choosing instead a seat near the edge of the main stage.\r\n\r\nThe lights dimmed. A new performer took the stage.\r\n\r\nKatya’s breath caught. The dancer was young, lithe, moving with practiced grace. Her body spoke a language Katya hadn't let herself understand in years—fluid, bold, defiant. There was something magnetic about her. Something familiar.\r\n\r\nKatya leaned forward, eyes narrowing. The performer dipped into a slow turn, arching her back with almost academic precision. The spotlight kissed her cheek, and for the first time, Katya saw her face clearly.\r\n\r\nRecognition hit like a glass shattering inside her chest.\r\n\r\nIt was Hailee. One of her students. One of her best students—quiet in class, sharp-witted on paper, always composed. Now here, under red light and stares, moving like someone with nothing to hide.\r\n\r\nKatya didn’t breathe. Her fingers tensed against her knee. The room, the music, the murmurs—all fell away. She stared, locked in place, a collision of worlds swirling in her chest: the professor and the woman, the rules and the ache. She knew she should leave. But she didn’t. She couldn’t. Not yet.\r\n\r\nThe music faded, leaving behind a low thrum of ambient sound and the rustle of money being gathered. Katya saw Hailee glistening under the stage lights, taking one final bow before retreating behind the curtain. The crowd murmured its approval, some clapping, some calling out, but Katya didn’t move. Her eyes stayed fixed on that stage long after it emptied.\r\n\r\nShe rose slowly, blazer still buttoned, her posture rigid against the low-lit haze of desire that hung in the air. Her heels tapped sharply on the floor as she made her way toward the side hallway—the path the dancers disappeared through. A waitress started to intercept her, but Katya’s glance was enough to send the girl pivoting away, intimidated by something she couldn’t name.\r\n\r\nIn her left hand, Katya lit a cigarette, the flare of the lighter casting a brief flicker over her face—sharp, unreadable. She held the cigarette like punctuation, something final and precise. Smoke curled up toward the ceiling as she walked with the composed menace of someone who knew power wasn’t about noise, but presence.\r\n\r\nThe curtain parted slightly ahead.\r\n\r\nKatya's eyes moved to Hailee who stepped out, now cloaked in a silk robe. Katya stood there. In full view. Smoke drifting around her like a shroud.\r\n\r\n“Impressive, just like the paper you turned to me last week Hailee,” Katya said, her voice low but clear, as if commenting on a particularly well-constructed thesis. But her eyes betrayed something else. Not judgment. Not quite. Curiosity? Hunger? A flicker of something far less academic.\r\n\r\nShe took a long drag from the cigarette, exhaled slowly, then stepped closer. The distance between them now just a breath. Her gaze lingered on Hailee’s face, then down, brief but unmistakable, before settling again on her eyes.\r\n\r\n“You’ve always been...disciplined,” Katya said, the edge of a smirk barely there, like a secret held between teeth. “I didn’t expect to find you here. But now that I have... I’m wondering what else I’ve underestimated.”\r\n\r\nKatya held her cigarette to the side, ash balanced neatly at the tip, waiting. Not dismissive. Not indulgent. Waiting to see what Hailee would say, or do—or if she’d do anything at all.","extra":{},"tracker":{}}

And we're done.\" **\n\nThe unspoken threat lingered in every syllable: *Test me.*","Katya’s hand snapped out—not rough, but *precise*—her fingers curling around Hailee’s wrist with the same effortless authority she used to silence a rowdy seminar. She didn’t yank. Didn’t need to. The weight of her grip alone was enough to freeze Hailee in place.\n\n**\"Us?\"** Katya repeated, voice dropping into something darker, velvet-wrapped steel. **\"Elaborate.\"**\n\nHer thumb pressed lightly against the frantic pulse point beneath Hailee’s skin—testing, measuring how fast that heartbeat raced at being caught. At being *stopped*. A professor still, even here; demanding answers with nothing more than a raised eyebrow and the unshakable expectation of compliance.\n\nThe noise of the club faded into white static around them as Katya stepped closer again, forcing Hailee to either retreat or stand her ground. Her free hand reached up slowly—so damn slowly—and hooked a single finger under the edge of that mask. Not pulling it away yet. Just *resting* there like a promise (or threat).\n\n**\"Because if they're selling you,\"** she continued softly, **\"I want to know what I'm bidding against.\"**\n\nA beat stretched between them before Katya finally released Hailee's wrist—but only to slide her palm flat against the small of her back instead, steering them both toward an alcove half-hidden by heavy drapes where prying eyes couldn't follow (where professors shouldn't be touching students like this).\n\nShe exhaled sharply through her nose when they were out of sight and crowded Hailee back against the wall without ceremony: one arm braced beside her head while the other stayed possessive on her hip despite every rule screaming otherwise inside Katya's skull right now... But then again since when had rules ever stopped hunger?\n\nLeaning down until their lips nearly brushed (close enough for shared breath but not quite crossing that line), Katya finally growled:\n\n***\"...Starting bid?\"***","Katya’s hand shot out—not rough, but firm—catching Hailee’s wrist just as she tried to slip past. Her grip was cool, deliberate, the kind of touch that didn’t bruise skin but left marks all the same.\n\n*\"Us?\"* She repeated, voice dropping lower. A professor dissecting a flawed argument. A woman tasting something illicit on her tongue.\n\nThe music from the main room pulsed like a second heartbeat between them as Katya stepped into Hailee’s retreat, forcing her back against the wall with nothing more than the weight of her presence. Close enough now that Hailee could see the faint silver threads in her dark hair, smell the lingering bite of cigarette smoke and bergamot on her skin.\n\n**\"How much?\"** Katya asked simply—no pretense, no coyness—just razor-edged intent laid bare between them. Her thumb traced idle circles over Hailee’s pulse point as she spoke: **\"Name your price.\"**\n\nA beat passed where neither breathed too deep. Then—\n\nHer lips curled at one corner in something too sharp to be called a smile: **\"Unless you'd prefer I bid against every man in there for you instead.\"**","Katya’s hand snapped out—not rough, but *precise*—her fingers wrapping around Hailee’s wrist with the same unyielding authority she used when silencing a chatty seminar. The contact burned through silk and skin alike.\n\n**\"Us?\"** A single syllable, sharp as a blade between ribs. Her thumb pressed into the delicate pulse point beneath Hailee’s sleeve, feeling the rabbit-quick flutter there. **\"You let strangers bid on you like livestock?\"**\n\nThe words weren’t disgusted. They were *curious*. Darkly so.\n\nBehind them, laughter and clinking glasses bled through velvet drapes—somewhere beyond that curtain, men were loosening ties and counting cash for the privilege of ruining whatever girl they bought tonight. And here was Hailee Marshall—*her* Hailee (since when had she thought that?)—about to walk straight into their hands without so much as a flinch.\n\nKatya stepped closer still until her blazer brushed against Hailee’s robe, until all that stood between them was breath gone shallow with something neither would name yet: fear? Want? Both?\n\nShe tilted her head slightly to catch those emerald eyes again before murmuring:\n**\"...How much?\"**","Katya’s hand shot out—not rough, but firm—her fingers wrapping around Hailee’s wrist with the same authority she used when halting a student mid-argument in a seminar.
