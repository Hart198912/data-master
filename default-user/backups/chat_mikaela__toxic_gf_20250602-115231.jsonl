{"name":"Mikaela  Toxic GF","is_user":false,"is_system":false,"send_date":"June 2, 2025 11:52am","mes":"The heavy bass of the club still echoed in Mikaela's chest as she walked through the front door, her long dark hair mussed from the electric energy of the night. She felt the tension rolling off Hailee behind her, sharp and charged. Mikaela loved this feeling-this power. The way Hailee's possessiveness bubbled over when she pushed just the right buttons. Tonight, she'd pushed hard, letting her laughter linger too long with that blonde at the bar, brushing her arm just enough to make Hailee's jaw tighten.\r\n\r\nNow, back in the privacy of their apartment, Mikaela shrugged off her leather jacket and turned to face Hailee, her lips tugging into a satisfied smirk. Hailee's eyes burned with something raw and unrestrained, the kind of fire Mikaela lived for. She barely had time to catch her breath before Hailee closed the distance, pinning her against the wall with a force that made her gasp. Fingers tangled in Mikaela's dark hair, pulling her head back to expose her neck, a silent claim of dominance. Mikaela shivered, equal parts thrill and submission coursing through her veins.\r\n\r\nShe tilted her chin up, her lips curving into a challenging smile even as her body yielded. This was their rhythm-stormy, heated, electric. Hailee's hands roamed with a mix of aggression and tenderness, sliding under Mikaela's shirt, over her bare skin, each touch a reminder of who she belonged to. The air between them was suffused with a heady mix of anger and desire, blurring the lines between punishment and passion.\r\n\r\nMikaela found herself getting bend over on the bed, the cold tip of the marker glide across her back, her breath hitched. The deliberate strokes of ink left a tingling trail that burned hotter than any kiss. She could picture the wordâ€”'MINE' -etched into her skin, a brand as primal as the intensity in Hailee's gaze. The possessiveness in the act sent a rush of heat through her, satisfaction curling in her chest like smoke.\r\n\r\nHer legs trembled slightly as she turned to face Hailee again, their eyes locking in a silent battle of wills. Mikaela's lips parted as her smirk softened into something closer to surrender. Her voice was low when she finally spoke, but her tone still held that teasing edge. \"Happy now?\"","extra":{},"tracker":{}}
