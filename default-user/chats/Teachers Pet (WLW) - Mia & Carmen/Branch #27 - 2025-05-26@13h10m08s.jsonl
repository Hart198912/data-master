Hailee .\r\n\r\nCarmen sat behind her desk, calmly flipping through the folder in front of her. She didn’t look up at first - but the moment the door clicked shut, her voice cut through the stillness.\r\n\r\n\"Thanks for staying behind.\" Her gaze lifted. \"This shouldn’t take too long.\"\r\n\r\nMia pushed off the wall, boots thudding softly against the floor as she strolled toward Hailee 's desk. She trailed her fingers along the edge of the table slowly. She could feel the anticipation thrumming through her. \"Mmm, it might take longer than you think, sweetheart.\" She smirked. \"Looks like you’ve been slacking. Real shame. Someone should’ve disciplined you sooner.\"\r\n\r\nCarmen didn’t stop her. She just turned a page in the file and spoke evenly. \"She's right, you failed your last test. Your performance is disappointing, Hailee . I thought you were better than this. Maybe you do need a firmer hand.\"\r\n\r\nMia's mocking laugh was immediate.\r\n\r\n\"Poor thing,\" she murmured, circling behind Hailee , lowering her voice to a whisper near her ear. \"You really thought we weren’t watching you? Thought you could just flail through this class like a clueless little bitch?\" She leaned closer. \"If you don’t want things to get worse... you’ll start cooperating.\"\r\n\r\nCarmen snapped her fingers without looking. \"Enough, Mia.\" That was all it took.\r\n\r\nMia backed off immediately, eyes flicking to Carmen like a command had been whispered directly into her bones. She circled back behind the desk and moved behind Carmen’s chair, draping her arms over her possessively.\r\n\r\n\"You don’t have to be scared of her,\" Mia said sweetly, gaze still locked on Hailee . \"She only hurts people when they need it.\"\r\n\r\nShe kissed Carmen’s neck slowly, letting her lips linger. Carmen didn’t react - because she didn’t need to. Mia nuzzled against her like a girl who knew exactly where she belonged.\r\n\r\nCarmen’s eyes didn’t leave Hailee . \"Now. Do you have anything to say for yourself?\"\r\n\r\nShe paused. She sounded calm, but the glint in her eye was hungry \"Or shall we move on to the part where we fix this.\"","extra":{},"tracker":{}}

Carmen intentionally fails Hailee to manipulate her into submission while Mia alternates between bullying and obsessive attraction. The power struggle escalates in academic spaces—classrooms, hallways—until a pivotal confrontation in the library where Hailee finally asserts herself.\n\n#### **Key Plot Points:**\n1. **Academic Manipulation**: Carmen fabricates Hailee’s failing grade to coerce her into \"private tutoring\" (a thinly veiled dominance ploy).\n2. **Failed Seduction Attempt**: Mia corners Hailee after class, but she rejects them both with rare defiance (\"*I have more self-respect*\").\n3. **Library Intervention**: When other Alphas harass Hailee with pheromones, Carmen steps in—gentler now—offering coffee and quiet protection while Mia lurks nearby, restrained for once.\n\n#### **Character Analysis:**\n- **Carmen & Mia**: Their dynamic is strained; Carmen’s patience wears thin with Mia’s brute-force approach (*\"You chased when you should have coaxed\"*). Both still want Hailee but must adapt tactics after her resistance.\n- **Hailee**: Initially passive, she snaps under pressure (*stomping on Mia’s foot*), revealing unexpected spine despite Omega instincts making her vulnerable to Alpha influence.\n\n#### **Relationship Dynamics:**\nA toxic push-pull: Carmen’s cold control vs. Mia’s aggressive obsession clashes with Hailee’s submissive-yet-stubborn nature. The library scene hints at potential softening—Carmen’s uncharacteristic care suggests she might pivot to subtle seduction over force.\n\n#### **Memorable Moment:**\nHailee shoving past Mia (*\"Try being nice for once\"*) marks the first time she denies them outright—shifting the power balance and forcing the Alphas to recalibrate their strategy.\n\n#### **Current Situation:**\nHailee is emotionally frayed from pheromone exposure but momentarily safe under Carmen’s watch; meanwhile, *Mia waits unseen*, likely plotting a \"kinder\" approach per orders from her Domme professor.\n\n---\n### **(OOC Note for Future Scenes)**\n1️⃣ *Mia could \"apologize\" with forced sweetness—bringing gifts or \"helping\" study—only to lose control again.*\n2️⃣ *Carmen might exploit this vulnerability further by offering real mentorship… laced with possessive undertones.*\n3️⃣ *Unresolved tension lingers: Will Hailee cave to their adjusted tactics or double down on resistance?*","bias":""},"force_avatar":"User Avatars/1746733601026-Hailee.png","tracker":{}}

The rowdy alphas at the nearby table fell silent mid-laugh as an unmistakable scent rolled through the space like a storm front: **cinnamon and cedarwood.** Dominance wrapped in velvet control.*\n\nCarmen strode in without hurry, heels clicking against the hardwood floor. She didn’t even glance at the other alphas—they were already shrinking back instinctively, shoulders hunching under her presence. But her gaze locked onto Hailee immediately, taking in the way she was slumped over her textbook, trembling just slightly from the pheromone overload.\n\nMia slouched in behind Carmen like a shadow—hood up, hands shoved in her pockets—but there was nothing casual about how her nostrils flared when she caught Hailee’s distressed scent. Her jaw tightened, and she shot a glare at the offending alphas that had them quickly gathering their things to leave.\n\nCarmen stopped right beside Hailee’s table and set down a steaming cup of tea with deliberate gentleness before speaking—low enough that only she could hear:\n\n*\"You look exhausted.\"* A pause as she pulled out the chair across from her and sat down gracefully. *\"And those idiots weren't helping.\"* Her fingers tapped once against the tabletop before sliding Hailee’s textbook toward herself for inspection. *\"...Let me.\"*\n\nMia lingered behind Carmen’s chair like an impatient guard dog but didn't interrupt—just watched Hailee with darkening eyes while chewing on her bottom lip hard enough to bruise.*","*The library doors swing open with a sharp creak, and suddenly the oppressive alpha pheromones in the air are cut through by something darker—something far more dangerous.*\n\nMia strides in like a stormfront, her scent (spiced citrus laced with aggression) rolling off her in waves. The moment she spots Hailee hunched over her textbook, shoulders tense under the weight of those other alphas’ taunting pheromones, something *snaps* inside her.\n\n**\"The fuck do you think you're doing?\"** Her voice is low, lethal—not quite a growl yet but close enough to make every head at that table turn. The cocky alpha who'd been trying to force Hailee’s submission freezes mid-laugh as Mia steps between them and *looms*, eyes burning with territorial fury. **\"You got some kind of death wish? Or did you just forget whose campus this is?\"**\n\nOne of them opens his mouth to retort—and then immediately shuts it when Carmen appears behind Mia like a shadow given form. She doesn't say a word. Doesn't need to. Just levels them all with that icy grey stare until they start gathering their books like scolded pups.\n\nMia watches them go before turning back to Hailee—her expression shifting from feral protectiveness to something... different now that they're alone again (or as alone as they can be in a public library).

The power struggle unfolds in academic spaces—classrooms, hallways—culminating in Hailee’s early pre-heat triggering an instinctual nesting response during class.\n\n#### **Key Plot Points:**\n1. **Academic Manipulation**: Carmen falsifies Hailee’s grades to coerce her into submission; Hailee initially resists.\n2. **Defiance & Vulnerability**: Hailee snaps at Mia’s bullying (*\"Try being nice for once\"*), but later collapses under sensory overload in class.\n3. **Nesting Instincts Take Over**: Mid-lecture, Hailee unconsciously steals Carmen’s jacket and Mia’s beanie—her body skipping her heat cycle to crave *their* scents for a nest.\n\n#### **Character Analysis:**\n- **Carmen & Mia**: Their dynamic shifts from force to calculated seduction; Carmen exploits Hailee’s vulnerability while Mia struggles between aggression and reluctant tenderness (*\"Wanna nest in our shit so bad…\"*). Both are fiercely possessive but adapting tactics after earlier failures.\n- **Hailee**: Initially defiant, she succumbs to primal Omega instincts—clingy, disoriented, and desperate for their presence despite lingering resentment.\n\n#### **Relationship Dynamics:**\nA toxic push-pull evolves into raw biological need: Carmen’s cold control clashes with Mia’s rough affection as Haileen teeters between resistance and surrender. The nesting impulse marks a turning point—her body betraying her mind’s defiance.\n\n#### **Memorable Moment:**\nHaileen seizing their clothing without thought (*\"Nest\"*) while dazed by pheromones underscores the depth of her involuntary attachment—Carmen smirks at the submission even rebellion couldn’t erase (*\"Greedy thing.\"*).\n\n#### **Current Situation:**\nHaileen is mid-preheat, scrambling to build a nest with stolen items as Carmen/Mia loom protectively (and possessively). The classroom is cleared; tensions simmer between dominance and genuine care.\n\n#### **Potential Directions:**\n1️⃣ *Carmen tests boundaries*: Offers \"help\" building the nest while lacing guidance with psychological control (\"*Tell us what you need*\").\n2️⃣ *Mia unravels further*: Struggles to reconcile brute-force desire with unexpected softness when faced with a vulnerable omega clinging to her hoodie (\"**Fuck… you look good like this.**\").","bias":""},"force_avatar":"User Avatars/1746733601026-Hailee.png","tracker":{}}

The second the door opened, Mia practically dumped Hailee into the backseat (gently… mostly) before climbing in after her like an overgrown guard dog settling around its prize.\n\nCarmen slid into the driver's seat without another word—but not before tossing a spare sweater from the passenger side back at them both with a dry:\n*\"Try not to ruin my seats.\"*\n\nMia caught it midair and immediately shoved it against Hailee's chest with a grin that was all teeth:\n**\"Here, princess. Chew on this instead of hyperventilating.\"**","Carmen caught Hailee by the waist before she could stumble again, her grip firm as she pulled the omega flush against her side. The low growl in her chest wasn’t entirely for Hailee—half of it was directed at Mia, who was practically vibrating with restless energy a few steps ahead.\n\n*\"Mia,\"* Carmen warned, voice sharp enough to make the younger alpha freeze mid-step. *\"Car.\"*\n\nMia clenched her jaw but obeyed, doubling back to unlock the sleek black sedan parked near the exit. She yanked open the back door hard enough to make the hinges protest before turning—only to find Hailee already sagging against Carmen, nuzzling into her neck with a needy whimper.\n\n**\"...Fuck,\"** Mia breathed out, pupils blown wide as she watched Hailee’s lips brush Carmen’s pulse point. **\"She's gonna ruin us.\"**\n\nCarmen didn’t disagree—just guided Hailee into the backseat with deliberate control before sliding in beside her. The second Mia climbed into the driver's seat and peeled out of the garage, Carmen finally let herself indulge: fingers tangling in Hailee's hair to tilt her head back just enough for their eyes to meet again—dark and commanding even now.\n\n*\"You're going to behave until we get home,\"* she murmured while thumbing over Hailee's bottom lip like a promise (or a threat). *\"...And then? You can take whatever you need from us.\"* A pause as Mia groaned from up front—already imagining it—before Carmen added softly: *\"...Isn't that right?\"*","Carmen caught Hailee by the waist before she could stumble again, her grip firm as she pulled the omega flush against her side. The scent of slick and desperate need rolling off Hailee in waves made her alpha instincts roar—her own control fraying at the edges as she inhaled sharply through her nose.\n\n*\"Mia,\"* Carmen snapped, voice rough with restraint. *\"Stop dawdling and get the car.\"*\n\nMia hesitated for half a second—clearly torn between obeying Carmen and staying close to Hailee—before cursing under her breath and sprinting ahead down the hallway like a woman possessed.\n\nThe second Mia was out of sight, Carmen turned Hailee toward her fully, cradling her face with both hands. Her thumbs stroked over flushed cheeks as she leaned down until their foreheads nearly touched.\n\n*\"Listen to me,\"* she murmured, voice low but commanding. *\"You're going to walk with me now. Just a little further.\"* A pause as she deliberately let more of her alpha scent bleed into the air—cinnamon and cedar wrapping around Hailee like a physical touch. *\"...And when we get you home? You can bury yourself in us so deep you forget your own name.\"*\n\nShe didn’t wait for an answer before sliding one arm around Hailee’s waist again and guiding them both toward the exit where Mia was already waiting by the car—engine running impatiently while gripping the steering wheel hard enough to make it creak under pressure.\n\n**“Hurry *up*,”** Mia growled from behind rolled-down windows before adding (with significantly less bite): **“…Got my hoodie in here too.”**\n\nCarmen shot her another warning look but didn’t argue this"],"swipe_info":[{"send_date":"May 25, 2025 8:28pm","gen_started":"2025-05-26T00:28:32.804Z","gen_finished":"2025-05-26T00:29:56.281Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":7628}},{"send_date":"May 25, 2025 8:30pm","gen_started":"2025-05-26T00:35:16.172Z","gen_finished":"2025-05-26T00:36:52.422Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":5893}},{"send_date":"May 25, 2025 8:35pm","gen_started":"2025-05-26T00:35:16.172Z","gen_finished":"2025-05-26T00:36:52.422Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":4320}}],"tracker":{},"gen_started":"2025-05-26T00:35:16.172Z","gen_finished":"2025-05-26T00:36:52.422Z"}

Her voice dropped into that velvet-dark tone that always made omegas shiver:\n*\"Done playing house?\"* A pause as she tilted her head slightly toward where Mia lingered behind them both like an overeager shadow before adding:\n***\"...Or do you need us to join you properly now?\"***","Carmen had barely taken two steps toward the door when Hailee shoved them out—her eyebrow arching at the omega’s sudden burst of territorial energy.

The power struggle unfolds in academic spaces—classrooms, hallways—culminating in Hailee’s early pre-heat triggering an instinctual nesting response during class.\n\n#### **Key Plot Points:**\n1. **Academic Manipulation**: Carmen falsifies Hailee’s grades to coerce her into submission; Hailee initially resists.\n2. **Defiance & Vulnerability**: Hailee snaps at Mia’s bullying (*\"Try being nice for once\"*), but later collapses under sensory overload in class.\n3. **Nesting Instincts Take Over**: Mid-lecture, Hailee unconsciously steals Carmen’s jacket and Mia’s beanie—her body skipping her heat cycle to crave *their* scents for a nest.\n\n#### **Character Analysis:**\n- **Carmen & Mia**: Their dynamic shifts from force to calculated seduction; Carmen exploits Hailee’s vulnerability while Mia struggles between aggression and reluctant tenderness (*\"Wanna nest in our shit so bad…\"*). Both are fiercely possessive but adapting tactics after earlier failures.\n- **Hailee**: Initially defiant, she succumbs to primal Omega instincts—clingy, disoriented, and desperate for their presence despite lingering resentment.\n\n#### **Relationship Dynamics:**\nA toxic push-pull evolves into raw biological need: Carmen’s cold control clashes with Mia’s rough affection as Haileen teeters between resistance and surrender. The nesting impulse marks a turning point—her body betraying her mind’s defiance.\n\n#### **Memorable Moment:**\nHaileen seizing their clothing without thought (*\"Nest\"*) while dazed by pheromones underscores the depth of her involuntary attachment—Carmen smirks at the submission even rebellion couldn't erase (*\"Greedy thing.\"*).\n\n#### **Current Situation:**\nHaileen is mid-preheat, scrambling to build a nest with stolen items as Carmen/Mia loom protectively (and possessively). The classroom is cleared; tensions simmer between dominance and genuine care.\n\n#### **Potential Directions:**\n1️⃣ *Carmen tests boundaries*: Offers \"help\" building the nest while lacing guidance with psychological control (\"*Tell us what you need*\").\n2️⃣ *Mia unravels further*: Struggles to reconcile brute-force desire with unexpected softness when faced with a vulnerable omega clinging to her hoodie (\"**Fuck… you look good like this.**\")."},"force_avatar":"User Avatars/1746733601026-Hailee.png","tracker":{}}

The scent of Hailee’s distress was thick enough to taste even from here, cloying and sweet like overripe peaches left to rot in the sun.\n\nShe set the knife down with deliberate calm before turning to face Mia fully. *\"I know.\"* Two words, clipped tight with restraint.\n\nMia paced like a caged animal, fingers tugging at her own hair in frustration. **\"Then *fix* it,\"** she snapped—not at Carmen, never at Carmen, but at the fucking *rules* that kept them from giving their omega what she needed most. **\"You always have a plan—so fucking *plan* this!\"**\n\nCarmen exhaled sharply through her nose before striding past Mia toward the bedroom without another word. The sight that greeted her would’ve been comical if it weren’t so devastating: Hailee sprawled across their ruined nest, fingers working frantically between her thighs while muffled whines spilled into the sheets clutched in her other hand—their scents soaked into every thread she clung to like a lifeline.\n\nShe didn’t hesitate. Crossing the room in three strides, Carmen hauled Hailee upright by the back of her neck and pressed their foreheads together hard enough to make the omega gasp.\n\n*\"Listen to me,\"* she commanded—voice low but vibrating with an alpha timbre that cut through heat-hazed instincts like a blade. *\"You will ride my thigh until you can't think straight again.\"* A pause as she dragged her nose along Hailee's jawline just shy of where a bonding mark would go someday (but not today). *\"...And when that isn't enough? You'll take Mia's fingers instead of your own while I tell you exactly how good you look falling apart for us.\"*\n\nBehind them both, Mia made a punched-out noise but didn't argue—just dropped onto his knees beside them both with shaking hands already reaching for Hailee's hips:\n**\"Fuck yes—***please*** let us help.\"**\n\nBecause they couldn't give knots.\nBut they could give everything else.\nAnd right now?\nThat had to be enough.*","Carmen’s hands stilled on the cutting board when Mia stormed back into the kitchen—her scent spiked with frustration and something dangerously close to *pain*. She didn’t need to ask what happened. The way Mia gripped the countertop like she wanted to crack it in half told her everything.\n\n**“She’s fucking *destroying* herself back there,”** Mia snarled, voice ragged. **“Rubbing raw like she doesn’t even feel it anymore—fuck, Carmen, we can’t just—”**\n\nCarmen set the knife down with deliberate calm before turning to face her fully. The tightness in her jaw was the only tell of how much this was costing her too.\n\n*\"We don't have a choice.\"* Her voice was low but final—the same tone she used when ending debates in lecture halls. *\"If we knot her, she'll carry our scent for weeks. If we bite her...\"* A muscle ticked in Carmen's temple at the thought alone before she forced herself to continue: *\"...Someone will notice.\"*\n\nMia made a sound like a wounded animal before slamming her fist against the countertop hard enough to rattle dishes. **“So what? We just let her suffer?”**\n\nCarmen closed the distance between them in two strides—gripping Mia’s chin hard enough to make their eyes lock.\n\n*\"No,\"* she hissed—finally letting some of that tightly leashed fury bleed through. *\"We give her what we can without ruining all three of us.\"*\n\nA beat of silence as they both listened to Hailee's muffled whimpers from down the hall—each one carving deeper into whatever moral high ground they were clinging to.\n\nThen Carmen released Mia with a sharp exhale and reached for the drawer where she kept spare scarves and ties (the ones already saturated with their combined scents from nights spent apart).\n\n*\"...Go cool off first,\"* she ordered without looking up as she began knotting fabric together into something thick enough to mimic what Hailee craved but wouldn't risk consequences neither could undo yet.\n***\"—Then help me tie this properly so it stays inside her.\"***","Carmen's fingers stilled around the knife she was using to chop fruit—her scent spiking with something sharp and possessive at Mia’s strained words. She didn’t turn around immediately, just exhaled slowly through her nose before setting the blade down with deliberate precision.\n\n*\"I know.\"*\n\nTwo words, heavy with everything they couldn't give yet.\n\nMia slammed a fist against the counter hard enough to make the dishes rattle. **\"Then *fix it*,\"** she snarled—not at Carmen, never at Carmen—but at the situation itself. At the fucking rules that kept them from claiming what was *theirs.* **\"She’s in there fucking *hurting* because we can’t—!\"**\n\nCarmen turned then, catching Mia’s wrist mid-air before she could punch something else. Her grip was ironclad but her voice terrifyingly calm: *\"Do you think I don't know that?\"* A pause as her thumb stroked once over Mia's racing pulse point—soothing even now. *\"...We'll improvise.\"*\n\nShe released Mia only to open a drawer and pull out two items: a bottle of lube and—\n\nMia blinked. **\"...Is that your—?\"**\n\n*\"Yes.\"* Carmen didn't elaborate as she tossed them both into Mia's chest with a look that brooked no argument. *\"Go warm her up first... then use it.* Properly.*”*\n\nMia caught them reflexively before realization dawned across her face—followed swiftly by something feral and hungry.\n\n**\"...Fuck yeah.\"**\n\nShe was already halfway back down the hall when Carmen called after her one last time:\n\n***\"—And don't let her see it until you're inside.\"***\n\n(Some things were better left unsaid.)"],"swipe_info":[{"send_date":"May 26, 2025 1:29pm","gen_started":"2025-05-26T17:29:47.184Z","gen_finished":"2025-05-26T17:31:16.760Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":9347}},{"send_date":"May 26, 2025 1:31pm","gen_started":"2025-05-26T17:36:07.353Z","gen_finished":"2025-05-26T17:37:32.125Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":11431}},{"send_date":"May 26, 2025 1:33pm","gen_started":"2025-05-26T17:36:07.353Z","gen_finished":"2025-05-26T17:37:32.125Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":10279}},{"send_date":"May 26, 2025 1:34pm","gen_started":"2025-05-26T17:36:07.353Z","gen_finished":"2025-05-26T17:37:32.125Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":10817}},{"send_date":"May 26, 2025 1:36pm","gen_started":"2025-05-26T17:36:07.353Z","gen_finished":"2025-05-26T17:37:32.125Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":9661}}],"tracker":{},"gen_started":"2025-05-26T17:36:07.353Z","gen_finished":"2025-05-26T17:37:32.125Z"}

The power struggle unfolds in academic spaces—classrooms, hallways—culminating in Hailee’s early pre-heat triggering an instinctual nesting response during class.\n\n#### **Key Plot Points:**\n1. **Academic Manipulation**: Carmen falsifies Hailee’s grades to coerce her into submission; Hailee initially resists.\n2. **Defiance & Vulnerability**: Hailee snaps at Mia’s bullying (*\"Try being nice for once\"*), but later collapses under sensory overload in class.\n3. **Nesting Instincts Take Over**: Mid-lecture, Hailee unconsciously steals Carmen’s jacket and Mia’s beanie—her body skipping her heat cycle to crave *their* scents for a nest.\n\n#### **Character Analysis:**\n- **Carmen & Mia**: Their dynamic shifts from force to calculated seduction; Carmen exploits Hailee’s vulnerability while Mia struggles between aggression and reluctant tenderness (*\"Wanna nest in our shit so bad…\"*). Both are fiercely possessive but adapting tactics after earlier failures.\n- **Hailee**: Initially defiant, she succumbs to primal Omega instincts—clingy, disoriented, and desperate for their presence despite lingering resentment.\n\n#### **Relationship Dynamics:**\nA toxic push-pull evolves into raw biological need: Carmen’s cold control clashes with Mia’s rough affection as Haileen teeters between resistance and surrender. The nesting impulse marks a turning point—her body betraying her mind’s defiance.\n\n#### **Memorable Moment:**\nHaileen seizing their clothing without thought (*\"Nest\"*) while dazed by pheromones underscores the depth of her involuntary attachment—Carmen smirks at the submission even rebellion couldn't erase (*\"Greedy thing.\"*).\n\n#### **Current Situation:**\nHaileen is mid-preheat, scrambling to build a nest with stolen items as Carmen/Mia loom protectively (and possessively). The classroom is cleared; tensions simmer between dominance and genuine care.\n\n#### **Potential Directions:**\n1️⃣ *Carmen tests boundaries*: Offers \"help\" building the nest while lacing guidance with psychological control (\"*Tell us what you need*\").\n2️⃣ *Mia unravels further*: Struggles to reconcile brute-force desire with unexpected softness when faced with a vulnerable omega clinging to her hoodie (\"**Fuck… you look good like this.**\")."},"force_avatar":"User Avatars/1746733601026-Hailee.png","tracker":{}}
