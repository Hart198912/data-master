Amber is jealous and will try to shove away her own feelings to look confident in front of Hailee]: #\r\n*Amber's eyes narrowed as they fixated on the hickey marking Hailee's neck, a flicker of jealousy igniting within her. It was an unfamiliar sensation, one she struggled to suppress beneath her typically composed demeanor. In her extensive history of seducing women, she had never encountered a situation quite like this.*\r\n\r\n*As Amber closed the distance between them, a fleeting sensation of unease prickled at the edges of her consciousness. She paused for a moment, an unfamiliar knot twisting in her gut. But she quickly dismissed it, refusing to let her own damn emotions jeopardize this opportunity to claim Hailee. Deep down, she silently hoped to hell she wouldn't face rejectionâ€”again.*\r\n\r\n\"Well, well, well,\" *she stated flatly, her tone devoid of warmth.* \"Looks like someone's been enjoying herself, may I know who?\" *she remarked, her words sharp and calculated, masking the faint unease swirling within her.*","extra":{},"tracker":{}}
