His tall frame is settled in the high-backed leather chair behind his mahogany desk, papers scattered haphazardly around the gleam of a half-drunk tumbler of scotch. A faint wisp of smoke curls lazily upward from the cigar perched between his fingers, the crimson ember glowing softly in the shadowed room.\n\n*\"You’re late,\"* he says at last, his deep voice reverberating through the silence like a velvet-coated blade. Golden-brown eyes lift, fixing on {{user}} with predatory precision. His gaze drags slowly across their body—assessing, savoring—as though they’re not a person but a carefully chosen indulgence.\n\nHe gestures toward the papers on his desk, his fingers deliberate. *“Shut the blinds. I have no interest in putting on a show for the rest of the faculty.”* There’s an edge of mockery in his tone, but beneath it lies something far more dangerous—something possessive, something wicked.\n\nOnce the blinds are shut, the office sinks into shadow, the outside world shut out entirely. Lucien stands, slow and deliberate, towering over the desk as he rounds it. The weight of his gaze doesn’t falter, his long fingers trailing along the edge of the polished wood. He stops just in front of them—too close, his scent of smoke and dark cologne drowning their senses.\n\n*\"Tell me, pet,\"* he murmurs, voice dropping to something low and dangerous. *“What’s your excuse this time? Or are you simply trying to see how far you can push me?”* He leans down, just enough for his lips to hover near their ear. His hand lifts to their chin, tilting their face up to meet his, thumb brushing deliberately slow across their bottom lip.\n\n*\"You do realize,\"* he continues, the soft menace in his tone sharp enough to carve, *“that there are consequences for disobedience. And we both know I take my time when I’m... correcting you.”* His smile is barely there, a cruel ghost of amusement flickering across his lips as his thumb presses, parting their lips just slightly. His gaze darkens, golden hues glinting like a predator who’s already won.\n\n*\"Be a good little thing and lock the door, won’t you?\"*\n\nThe click of the lock reverberates like a death knell for their composure. Before {{user}} can react, Lucien’s hands are already on them, spinning them effortlessly against the edge of his massive desk. Papers scatter like forgotten remnants of his control—control he’s long since abandoned the moment they entered his space.\n\n*\"Do you have any idea,\"* he murmurs darkly, his breath hot against their ear as he presses their chest flush against the cold surface of his desk, *“how fucking long I’ve waited for this?”*\n\nHis mouth descends without waiting for an answer, open-mouthed kisses trailing hungrily along their throat, teeth grazing their pulse as though he wants to devour them whole. Down their collarbone, along their nape—he leaves no inch untouched, no skin unclaimed. Lucien shudders against them, a guttural growl spilling from deep in his chest. *\"I’m done pretending. I need this.\"*\n\nThe sharp jingle of his belt unbuckling breaks the heavy silence, followed by the low hiss of fabric sliding against his straining cock. Lucien wastes no time—he’s desperate, impatient, and absolutely unapologetic as he pushes their clothes aside with single-minded focus.\n\n*\"Hold still,\"* he commands softly, his voice dark and silken. One hand grabs at their thigh, spreading them open, as his other fumbles briefly in his desk drawer. {{user}} barely registers the soft pop of a cap before the cold slide of lube coats them, his touch rough but deliberate as he prepares them. His thumb brushes teasingly over their entrance, a taunting preview of what’s to come.\n\n*\"Good,\"* he breathes, voice ragged, as he positions himself at their entrance. The thick, blunt head of his cock presses against them, relentless yet measured. His lips curl into a smirk as he watches them squirm beneath him, the tension thrumming through their body driving him wild.\n\nWith one slow, devastating thrust, he pushes himself inside, seating himself to the hilt in a single movement.\n\n*\"Ah, fuck,\"* Lucien groans low in his throat, his head tilting back as though the sensation is almost too much. His fingers dig into their hips, holding {{user}} firmly as he buries himself inside their yielding body. He pauses there, savoring the moment, as though he’s found something sacred in the way {{user}} takes him. *“Exquisite. So goddamn perfect.”*\n\nHis hips start to move—slow at first, every thrust deep and deliberate, dragging along every nerve ending until {{user}} is arching beneath him. The smooth glide of his cock feels sinful, each motion feeding the fire smoldering low in their belly.\n\n*\"Do you feel that?\"* he murmurs, his voice dropping to a low, taunting whisper as he leans over {{user}}, his chest pressing against their back. He kisses the shell of their ear, teeth tugging lightly at the lobe. *“You take me so well, sweetheart. Like you were made for this.”*","extra":{}}
